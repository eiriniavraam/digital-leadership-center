# take into account bi- and tri-grams
'''
Lane and colleagues [1] offer a very effective desccription of what n-grams 
and explaing why we should care about them: 

"An n-gram is a sequence containing up to n elements that have been extracted 
from a sequence of those elements, usually a string. In general the “elements” 
of an n-gram can be characters, syllables, words, or even symbols like “A,” 
“T,” “G,” and “C” used to represent a DNA sequence.6 In this book, we’re only 
interested in n-grams of words, not characters.7 So in this book, when we 
say 2-gram, we mean a pair of words, like “ice cream.” When we say 3-gram, we 
mean a triplet of words like “beyond the pale” or “Johann Sebastian Bach”
r “riddle me this.” n-grams don’t have to mean something special together, 
like com- pound words. They merely have to be frequent enough together to 
catch the attention of your token counters. Why bother with n-grams? As you 
saw earlier, when a sequence of tokens is vectorized into a bag-of-words 
vector, it loses a lot of the meaning inherent in the order of those words. 
By extending your concept of a token to include multiword tokens, n-grams, 
your NLP pipeline can retain much of the meaning inherent in the order of 
words in your statements. For example, the meaning-inverting word “not” will 
remain attached to its neighboring words, where it belongs. Without n-gram 
tokenization, it would be free floating. Its meaning would be associated 
with the entire sentence or document rather than its neighboring words. 
The 2-gram “was not” retains much more of the meaning of the individual 
words “not” and “was” than those 1-grams alone in a bag-of-words vector. A 
bit of the context of a word is retained when you tie it to its neighbor(s) 
in your pipeline."

Concerning the detection of n-grams, Gensim 'model.phrases' 
function (see [2]) allows to detect "common phrases -- aka multi-word 
expressions, word n-gram  collocations -- from a stream of sentences."

# %% get corpus & dictionary to use for further nlp analysis

'''
I suggest to prepare the dictionary and the corpus `once for all' -- that is, 
dumping the files that, eventually, will be loaded for further analysis.
'''

# get dictionary and write it to a file
'''
a dictionary is a mapping between words and their integer ids. See Gensim 
documentation here: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/corpora/dictionary.html
'''
pr_dictionary = Dictionary(docs_phrased)
pr_dictionary.save('.data/pr_dictionary.dict')

# get corpus and write it to a file
'''
as per the Gensim documentation, it possible to convert document into the 
bag-of-words (format = list of (token_id, token_count) tuples) via doc2bow
'''
pr_corpus = [pr_dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in docs_phrased]
'''
Gensim offers several utilities to write a corpus of text to a file. 
Personally, I prefer the Matrix Market format [1]
