The Federal Reserve\'s portfolio runoff has been blamed by some investors for recent market volatility, but many economists and Fed officials think such criticism is misplaced. As evidence they point to the recent drop in long-term interest rates, suggesting plentiful demand for new Treasury debt remains despite less buying by the central bank. Meanwhile, the Fed\'s new head economist will be Stacey Tevlin, a Fed board of governors economist who has spent more than two decades at the central bank. And, on a busy day for news out of China, a senior banker has been picked as the country\'s top securities regulator.\n\nNow on to today\'s news and analysis.\n\nA $4 Trillion Scapegoat for Market Volatility: Shrinking Fed Portfolio\n\nSome investors "https://centralbanking.cmail19.com/t/d-l-nkrhrdd-jlohthuq-t/" on the Federal Reserve shrinking its bond portfolio. But the critique puzzles Fed officials and some economists because there is little evidence of turmoil in the two markets where the central bank actively intervened: Treasurys and mortgage debt.\n\nStocks Start Off 2019 With a Bang\n\nStocks around the world "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stocks-start-off-2019-with-a-bang-11548590400" at the fastest pace in months, the latest sign that the fears investors grappled with late last year have largely subsided. Some analysts have credited the rally to bets that the Federal Reserve will slow its pace of interest-rate increases and hopes that the U.S. and China will make progress on trade negotiations. Yet beneath the rally, signs of caution have emerged, unsettling investors who believe that the gains belie a market that remains on fragile footing.\n\n"https://www.wsj.com/articles/overlap-of-tech-earnings-trade-talks-fed-meeting-will-test-stocks-11548594001?tesla=y&mod=article_inline"\n\nFor the FOMC, Out With  \x18Gradual\' and in With  \x18Patient\'?\n\nThere\'s a good chance the Federal Reserve is about to get a new mantra.\n\nA number of economists believe that when the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee releases its policy statement Wednesday, there will be a rhetorical shift in how officials describe the path for monetary policy.\n\nIn recent years, the Fed has said it would "gradually" raise short-term interest rates. But now, with uncertainty about the outlook rising in a climate with low inflation, the future of rate increases isn\'t clear. The Fed needs a new way to convey that.\n\nIt could do that by echoing the remarks of a number of its top officials, and offer up some variation of saying it can be "patient" with monetary policy.\n\n"The most challenging topic" facing the Fed when it meets this week is how to portray its rate guidance, J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli writes. The Fed\'s December statement indicated "some further gradual increases" were likely, but Fed officials have backed away from that over recent weeks, Mr. Feroli writes. He reckons the Fed could say it can be "patient" given its current inflation expectations.\n\nUBS says in a note to clients it expects the Fed to say it can be "patient in making any further gradual increases" in its benchmark federal-funds rate. Morgan Stanley\'s Ellen Zentner writes: "Look for the word  \x18patience\' to usurp  \x18gradual\' in the statement."\n\nIf the Fed does shoehorn "patient" into its policy statement as a way to signal more rate rises lie some distance away, if they arrive at all, officials will have definitely laid the groundwork for that shift.\n\n"We are in a place where we can be patient and flexible and wait and see what does evolve," Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Jan. 10. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on the same day that "with inflation muted, I believe that the [Fed\'s rate-setting] committee can afford to be patient as we see how the data evolve in 2019."\n\nAnd then on Jan. 18, New York Fed leader John Williams said: "The approach we need is one of prudence, patience and good judgment. The motto of  \x18data dependence\' is more relevant than ever."\n\nIf the Fed goes for "patient," it would be another sign of how much the outlook for monetary policy has changed. When the Fed kicked off rate rises in December 2015, it touted its plans to make "gradual adjustments" in short-term rates. Some variation of that phrase has attended the entirely of the tightening cycle to date.\n\nNow, policy makers are moving into a world where changes in monetary policy are less certain and will be driven by the economy\'s performance. By switching to "patient," Fed officials could better signal they face little pressure to act, and that rates are likely to remain around current levels for some time.\n\nFed Names Stacey Tevlin New Head Economist\n\nThe Fed announced a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-names-stacey-tevlin-research-director-11548435944" Friday, naming an internal candidate to lead its crucial research division at a time of slowing economic growth in the U.S. and abroad. Stacey Tevlin, an economist with the Fed\'s Washington-based board of governors, will succeed David Wilcox as director of the central bank\'s division of research and statistics on Feb. 4. Mr. Wilcox recently retired after a 30-year career at the Fed.\n\nNew York Fed\'s Growth Tracker Sees 4th-Quarter GDP at 2.6%\n\nThe New York Fed\'s Nowcast, a real-time tracker of growth in the U.S. economy, leaves its reading of fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth at 2.6% and its reading of first-quarter growth at 2.2%. The Atlanta Fed\'s GDPNow tracker hasn\'t been updated since Jan. 16, and it is unclear when it will be given the partial government shutdown that has interrupted the flow of official data on the economy.

Derby)\n\nPBOC Releases Liquidity Via Targeted Reserve-Requirement Ratio Cut\n\nChina\'s central bank on Friday released 250 billion yuan ($36.97 billion) of liquidity by lowering the reserve-requirement ratio for some banks that extended loans to small businesses. The People\'s Bank of China last year set an annual targeted RRR cut mechanism to encourage more bank lending to small companies. Qualified banks that extend substantial loans to small firms, can get as much as a 1.5-percentage-point RRR cut. In early January, the PBOC further loosened the policy, allowing more companies to be classified as small firms, which in turn made more Chinese banks eligible for the reserve cut. The PBOC said in Friday\'s statement that more banks will be eligible for the RRR cut in 2019, though it didn\'t provide further details.

Outstanding mortgage loans to home buyers increased 17.8% from a year earlier to 25.75 trillion yuan ($3.793 trillion) at the end of 2018, 4.4 percentage points lower than at the end of 2017, the People\'s Bank of China said Friday. Outstanding loans to property developers climbed 22.6% at the end of 2018 to 10.19 trillion yuan, 5.5 percentage points faster than a year earlier, the PBOC said.

Uncertainty over the trade dispute coursed through conversations at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year. Many executives also said the two countries\' tussle for economic and technological supremacy is adding a new layer of unpredictability to their longer-term business outlooks.\n\nEconomic Outlook Better Than Perceived, JPMorgan\'s Frenkel Says\n\nThe outlook for the global economy is less gloomy than many expect, JPMorgan International Chairman Jacob Frenkel told CNBC in an interview at Davos. "I do see clouds, but I don\'t see it from the perspective of a crisis," Mr. Frenkel said. "Superficially, it looks like the mood is not extraordinarily glowing, but the situation is not as bad as some people make it to be." The U.S. economy is in good shape due to policies like tax cuts and deregulation, while the slowdown in China has been engineered by policy makers to prevent a bubble forming, he said. "The Chinese government seems to have its hold on the economy," he added. (Patrick Costello)\n\nAs Warren Eyes White House, Big Banks Brace for Browbeating\n\nBy Andrew Ackerman and Reid J. Epstein\n\nElizabeth Warren\'s presidential bid will be "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-warren-eyes-white-house-big-banks-brace-for-browbeating-11548671401?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" her populist assault on big banks that rose to prominence during the financial crisis and in her successful 2012 Massachusetts Senate race.\n\nAlthough the economy has recovered and new, stricter regulations remain largely in place, Ms. Warren sees cause for further vigilance and many on Wall Street dread another round of browbeating on an even bigger national stage \x14the Democratic presidential primary race.\n\n"Banks exercise too much power in Washington," Ms. Warren said in a recent interview. "One of the main things I\'ve done is grass-roots organizing to wave the flag and point out what\'s going on here and get some political pushback. Otherwise Congress and the administration will just continue to work for the big banks."\n\nU.S. banks are approaching Ms. Warren\'s candidacy with trepidation. "The banking industry is a lot different than it was in 2008," said Richard Hunt, president and chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association. "Most people know that but she still seems to be living in 2008-land."\n\nAs president, Ms. Warren would represent a striking change to the Trump administration\'s deregulatory approach to Wall Street and bank officials worry she would take a more adversarial tack than the Obama administration, which put the financial sector under tougher scrutiny after the 2008 crisis.\n\nHer campaign policy proposals include tearing apart the biggest U.S. banks by reviving a modern version of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which had separated commercial and investment banking before it was repealed in 1999. She backs a mandate that workers elect at least 40% of corporate boards, holding Wall Street executives liable for criminal misconduct at their firms and tougher federal oversight of the credit-reporting industry in the wake of the hack of Equifax Inc.\n\nIf elected, she would likely appoint regulators who would push for companies to disclose their spending on political activities as well as complete a raft of unfinished curbs to compensation for financial firms from the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, measures that supporters say will damp excessive risk taking.\n\nAn indirect threat to the industry may be the reception Ms. Warren\'s ideas receive with primary voters. Their response, if energetic, could nudge other Democratic presidential hopefuls to embrace the proposals as well. After the 2016 presidential primary, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\'s popular call for free college tuition found its way into the platforms of other liberal Democrats.\n\n"She has this sort of applause line that we are all crooks, which is scary that you may hear that for a year and a half," said a large U.S. bank executive who asked to remain anonymous for fear of a Warren backlash.\n\nA former Harvard Law School professor, Ms. Warren\'s signature accomplishment before being elected was helping the Obama administration launch the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea she floated in a 2007 article. Since then, the 69-year-old Ms. Warren has become a formidable obstacle to both to Republicans seeking to ease the postcrisis financial rulebook she helped craft and Democrats she viewed as too cozy with the financial industry.\n\nLast spring, Ms. Warren drew a private rebuke from Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), after the Massachusetts senator attacked a group of centrist Democrats by name in a fundraising email for their support of legislation to ease red tape for smaller banks \x14the most significant, bipartisan effort to ease postcrisis rules to date.\n\n"If Republicans \x14and even some Democrats \x14are going to help the bank lobbyists roll back Wall Street reform, we\'re going to make sure the American people know about it," Ms. Warren wrote in a March fundraising appeal that included a list of Republican and Democratic senators who backed the changes.\n\nMr. Schumer\'s reaction: Criticize the substance of the legislation, not its Democratic supporters, according to people familiar with the one-on-one meeting. Ms. Warren declined to discuss her conversation with Mr. Schumer. "I don\'t think I ought to be talking about private meetings," she said.\n\nThe bill ultimately passed in March on a 67-31 vote, with the support of 17 members of the Democratic caucus, and became law in May. "Nobody likes it when one of their colleagues from the same party publicly criticizes them," said Judy Reardon, a former chief legal counsel to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), who backed the legislation.\n\nMs. Warren has had some success at playing a behind-the-scenes spoiler for centrist lawmakers by effectively blocking them from gaining traction in Congress.\n\nTwo years ago, Virginia Democrat Mark Warner and then-Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) were developing a plan to overhaul mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which have been in government conservatorship since the crisis. For weeks, Messrs. Corker and Warner pressed Ms. Warren in private meetings to join their legislation. They calculated that her support would ensure buy-in from other liberal Democrats needed to help the bill reach the 60 votes to pass the chamber.\n\nUltimately, Ms. Warren balked, and the legislation stalled. "There is no one Warner and Corker courted more assiduously than Elizabeth Warren," said Milan Dilal, a former aide to Mr. Warner.\n\nIn other cases, she has succeeded in getting regulators to reconsider policy moves.\n\nShe pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last year to agree to have the central bank\'s board vote in any future decision to free Wells Fargo & Co. from a limit on its growth \x14an "asset cap" that is the product of the bank\'s repeated failures to address widespread consumer abuses. A bank spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nBut she\'s had some losses, too.\n\nShe was unable last year to stop the Trump administration from making the consumer bureau she championed more business friendly. She and other Democrats also failed to block the White House\'s pick to head the CFPB, Director Kathy Kraninger, who is expected to ease rules on payday lenders among other changes.\n\nMs. Warren\'s backers and detractors agree she has successfully leveraged her role on the Senate Banking Committee into a forum for interrogating regulators and bank officials.\n\nIn 2017, she challenged the credibility of Zions Bancorp Chief Executive Harris Simmons, who urged lawmakers to relax bank rules. Those arguments, Ms. Warren said, mirrored similar ones he made to Congress in the lead up to the financial crisis, when his firm took about $1.5 billion in federal bailout money.\n\n"When you say today that Congress can safely rollback the rules on banks like yours and there won\'t be any risks to taxpayers, why should anyone believe you," she asked.\n\nMr. Simmons, in a written statement, said his views mirrored those of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who ultimately backed the de-regulatory bill that became law last May.\n\nWhile she has been critical of Democrats who have crossed her on banking issues, Ms. Warren in 2018 moved to repair some of the political damage.\n\nShe was among the party\'s top surrogates in the midterm elections, raising money for dozens of Democratic candidates \x14including incumbents such as Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, all of whom voted for the banking bill she opposed.\n\n"I know the difference between a Democratic majority and a Republican majority," Ms. Warren said of her more supportive stance toward her colleagues. "I work hard to get my Democratic colleagues re-elected and to get new Democrats elected."\n\nPopular Hedge Fund Bet on Fannie and Freddie Is Paying Off Big This Year\n\nBy Juliet Chung and Andrew Ackerman\n\nSome of Wall Street\'s biggest investors "https://www.wsj.com/articles/popular-hedge-fund-bet-on-fannie-and-freddie-is-paying-off-big-this-year-11548504001?tesla=y" on a paper windfall this year as the government ratchets up a debate over the future of mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nThe increased rhetoric has so far led to a surge in the companies\' shares and paper profits for their investors, including mutual-fund giant Capital Group Cos. and hedge funds Discovery Capital Management LLC, Blackstone Group \'s GSO Capital Partners LP, Paulson & Co., Perry Capital and Pershing Square Capital Management LP, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nFor more than a decade, lawmakers have tried and failed to overhaul Fannie and Freddie, which were placed in conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis. But recent statements by administration officials indicating the government plans to move soon on taking the firms out of conservatorship have sent shares surging. The common shares of Fannie and Freddie are up more than 170% this year, while the most commonly traded class of the preferred shares, a form of senior equity that used to pay a dividend, are up more than 37%.\n\nSeveral of the funds own different classes of preferred shares. Pershing Square largely owns common shares.\n\nHedge funds have been betting on Fannie and Freddie\'s privatization for years. They have pressed their case for much of that time with lawmakers, but have been buffeted by political and legal developments that have swung the companies\' shares wildly. The trade has run for such a long time \x14a decade for some \x14that some early investors in it are closing down or have dramatically different businesses now.\n\nPerry told clients in 2016 it was closing but continues to hold Fannie and Freddie in vehicles it is winding down, while Claren Road Asset Management LLC has changed its name and shrunk to managing $300 million but is still investing in the companies, said people familiar with the firms.\n\nThere is no guarantee a deal to end conservatorship will come to fruition. Repeated efforts to overhaul the firms have failed since the financial crisis as the issue is politically fraught; a change to the status of the firms could hurt the price and availability of mortgages for millions of Americans.\n\nBut should a plan go forward, it would conclude the biggest unresolved legacy from the financial crisis \x14what to do with the failed mortgage-finance companies \x14and partly determine whether hedge funds wind up profiting from their wagers.\n\n"It\'s night and day," said David Barrosse of Washington, D.C., policy analysis firm Capstone LLC, of the change in political will to privatize Fannie and Freddie. "We think that the signs are there for anyone to see, in public statements: This is happening now."\n\nFannie and Freddie are central players in the mortgage market, buying mortgages from lenders and packaging them for issuance as securities. The government effectively nationalized them in 2008 in a bid to stabilize the housing market as mortgage defaults mounted.\n\nIn return for injecting about $190 billion into the firms, the government created a new class of stock \x14senior preferred shares \x14that paid an annual 10% dividend, along with warrants to acquire nearly 80% of the firms\' common stock. The Treasury revamped its bailout agreement in 2012 to require nearly all the firms\' profits be swept away as dividend payments on those preferred shares. Investors filed suit over the change.\n\nHedge funds, which largely own preferred shares, have been betting they will recoup on their preferreds something close to par, or 100 cents on the dollar. Some funds scooped up preferreds for cents on the dollar when the firms collapsed.\n\nHedge funds have been pushing for the government to raise fresh capital for the companies and sell its stake on the market. That way, investors hope, they might be paid out. Hedge funds argue the firms\' restructuring would bolster a slowing housing market and move liability from taxpayers to private shareholders.\n\nFannie and Freddie have sent roughly $292 billion to the federal government since their bailouts in 2008. Investors point out that return relative to the amount of government aid the firms received far outstrips the $16 billion return on TARP, the federal bailout fund for banks during the crisis.\n\nHedge funds could also benefit if lawsuits investors have filed related to the government\'s rewrite of the bailout terms are decided in their favor.\n\nTo help their bet, fund managers and analysts have made regular visits to Treasury and Congress, kept investment staffers in Washington and hired specialist public relations firms.\n\nSeveral investors have close ties to senior Trump administration officials. John Paulson, for example, invested inOneWest Bank, the lender rehabilitated by executives that included Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Joseph Otting, acting chief of Fannie and Freddie\'s federal regulator. Mr. Mnuchin also invested in Mr. Paulson\'s hedge fund before he became Treasury secretary.\n\nA growing cadre of investors who aren\'t suing the government, including Paulson and GSO, are behind a proposal by investment bank Moelis & Co. that calls for allowing Fannie and Freddie to recapitalize by ending the profit sweep and issuing new common and preferred stock. Moelis, which is advising some holders of Fannie and Freddie\'s preferred shares, estimates the government could make up to $125 billion through the sale of its warrants for the companies\' common stock.\n\nInvestors peg the total face value of preferred shares at more than $30 billion.\n\nA Trump administration plan to release the companies from government control is technically feasible, but analysts said it may be difficult to pull off partly because Congress would be unhappy that the administration was sidestepping it.\n\nDiscovery, GSO and Perry are up on the trade overall, said people familiar with the firms.\n\nKPMG Gets Poor Marks From Audit Regulator\n\nBy Michael Rapoport\n\nAudit regulators "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kpmg-gets-poor-marks-from-audit-regulator-11548460081?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" in nearly half the KPMG LLP audits they scrutinized in their last two years of inspections, according to reports issued Friday.\n\nIn what amounted to a public rebuke, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board also unsealed some harsh criticisms of KPMG it had made in the past, in which the regulator suggested the Big Four accounting firm had been less committed to audit quality than it had claimed to be.\n\nThe long-delayed reports from the PCAOB shed new light on a KPMG information-leaking scandal that erupted in 2017 and led to the firing and indictment of some KPMG partners. The partners allegedly took steps to improperly learn in advance which of the firm\'s audits the PCAOB planned to examine during its annual inspections. Prosecutors have said the "steal the exam" scheme was motivated by a desire to help KPMG better prepare for the PCAOB\'s inspections \x14closely watched assessments of the firm\'s performance on which it had previously fared poorly.\n\nIn a statement Friday, KPMG said audit quality "has been and continues to be a top priority across all levels of KPMG." The firm said it was "committed to improving our performance and our system of audit quality control" and was making "significant investments in our people, technology and governance" toward that end.\n\nPCAOB inspectors found significant deficiencies in 22 of the 51 KPMG audits they reviewed in the 2016 inspection cycle, and 26 of the 52 they reviewed in the 2017 cycle.\n\nThe leaks came to light when the PCAOB\'s 2016 inspection report was pending and its 2017 inspection was being planned; the regulator said in Friday\'s reports that KPMG partners\' "improper advance notice" of which audits the PCAOB would review had compromised its plans. In the 2016 cycle, that led the board to replace 11 of the audits it had initially reviewed with 10 new ones. The PCAOB said it found nine of the 10 newly added audits to have deficiencies, compared with three of the 11 original audits \x14illustrating the extent to which advance knowledge of the PCAOB\'s plans could have helped KPMG.\n\nIn its 2017 inspection, the PCAOB selected 51 new audits to review after it learned that KPMG had obtained advance word of those that the board had initially selected.\n\nThe PCAOB also made public some criticism of KPMG it had previously made confidentially. In an inspection report initially issued in 2015, for instance, the PCAOB said KPMG\'s failure to implement a structured process for assessing its partners\' audit quality "may suggest that the firm is not as committed to promoting and rewarding good audit quality, and discouraging and addressing poor audit quality, as its formal communications may suggest."\n\nThe criticisms were in sealed portions of the PCAOB inspection reports evaluating KPMG\'s quality controls. Those portions are kept sealed permanently if a firm addresses any criticisms to the PCAOB\'s satisfaction within 12 months, but the board decided KPMG hadn\'t done so.\n\nIn a written response to the PCAOB\'s move included with the unsealed criticisms, KPMG said part of the problem was that its efforts to address the issues the PCAOB had cited were overseen in part by the same people involved in the leaking scandal. Their conduct was "contrary to the firm\'s Code of Conduct, what we expect and demand of our people, and intolerable," KPMG said, adding that it had since overhauled its leadership and internal processes.\n\nNo further regulatory action has been taken against KPMG, and it isn\'t known whether the PCAOB plans any. A PCAOB spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThree people, including a former KPMG partner, have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the matter. Two others, including David Middendorf, KPMG\'s former national managing partner for audit quality and professional practice, are scheduled to stand trial in federal court in New York next month. Another KPMG partner charged in the case is scheduled to go on trial in October. Mr. Middendorf\'s attorney couldn\'t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nChina Replaces Top Securities Regulator Amid Market Weakness\n\nChina "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-replaces-top-securities-regulator-amid-market-weakness-11548508752?tesla=y" with a senior banker, as authorities look for ways to boost market sentiment amid a broad economic slowdown.\n\nYi Huiman, chairman of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, will be the new chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, replacing Liu Shiyu, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Saturday, citing a decision by China\'s top leadership.\n\nMr. Yi, 54, started leading ICBC, the nation\'s largest bank by assets and most profitable lender, in 2016. He is known within the banking industry for enforcing strong risk controls, according to people familiar with him.\n\nInvestors had been calling for a change. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 25% last year, while China\'s Shenzhen index fell even more. Some Chinese economists estimate that as much as 15% of last year\'s plunge in the Shanghai index was due to trade tensions with the U.S., which increased uncertainty over China\'s economic outlook.\n\nLiu Shiyu, also a former banker, had been put in place to turn a new page for China\'s stock market after a 2015 crash. Many investors believe China\'s government ultimately controls the markets, a sentiment reinforced after state-backed investors and funds stepped in to stabilize trading after the mid-2015 meltdown.\n\nSince then, officials have taken steps to loosen their hold on the market, and Beijing pledged to let foreign firms take bigger stakes in Chinese securities ventures.\n\nBut the market remains stuck at a multiyear low, and some investors have felt the regulator didn\'t make enough progress in market reforms. A push to lure big Chinese tech firms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to list on the mainland also stalled.\n\nSome investors felt Mr. Liu still preferred guiding the market with a heavy hand, stifling companies\' ability to use the stock market as a refinancing channel. He was known to use unusually strong rhetoric against suspected market manipulators, warning that his commission was on the watch for "barbarians" and "big capitalist crocodiles."\n\nMarkets rose whenever there were rumors that Mr. Liu would leave his post. Disgruntled investors even turned to an official Chinese social-media account of the U.S. Embassy to vent their frustrations, calling out Mr. Liu by name. The embassy was forced to turn off some comment functions.\n\nMr. Liu couldn\'t be reached for comment Saturday.\n\nMaintaining investor confidence will be a key task for Mr. Yi.\n\n"I\'m sure he\'s fairly competent because he worked his way from the bottom," said an economist at a Chinese brokerage firm, referring to Mr. Yi, who started his career as a junior staff at a local bank. That said, it might have been good to promote someone from within the securities regulator itself who specializes in markets, the economist added.\n\nChina\'s economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades last year. Beijing has stepped up its efforts to spur growth by pumping more funds into financial markets and jump-starting infrastructure projects.\n\nThe appointment had been widely anticipated in recent days. Mr. Liu, who took the helm of the securities regulator in early 2016, will move to the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, a little-known financial organization, according to state media.\n\n \x14Grace Zhu and Liyan Qi contributed to this article.\n\nAre ICO Tokens Securities? Startup Wants a Judge to Decide\n\nBy Paul Vigna and Dave Michaels\n\nA Canadian social-media startup is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-ico-tokens-securities-startup-wants-a-judge-to-decide-11548604800?tesla=y" Washington\'s ability to regulate the fledgling cryptocurrency industry.\n\nSocial-media startup Kik Interactive Inc. of Waterloo, Ontario, plans to fight an expected enforcement action from the Securities and Exchange Commission over a 2017 initial coin online offering, Chief Executive Ted Livingston told The Wall Street Journal, setting the stage for a legal battle that could have broad ramifications for the digital-currency market.\n\nThe SEC\'s enforcement division believes Kik issued an unregistered security when it sold $100 million in "kin," a digital token that Kik says works like a currency on the its platform, according to Mr. Livingston and documents reviewed by the Journal.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment.\n\nAt issue is whether kin should be considered an investment security. The SEC has said most tokens issued in ICOs, public offerings of bitcoin-like digital tokens that exploded in popularity in 2017, fall into that category. Yet Kik and others in the cryptocurrency industry say the tokens represent a new kind of asset that shouldn\'t be subject to the same rules as stock or bond offerings.\n\nA court battle with Kik could help determine the scope of the SEC\'s authority to tame the unruly ICO market, which has been used by legitimate startups and scammers alike to raise more than $20 billion since 2014. The SEC has taken aim at several token issuers, but a judge in a civil case has yet to rule on the central question of whether ICOs should be considered securities offerings. A loss for the agency could curtail its efforts to root out fraudulent offerings and give rise to a new crop of ICO scams.\n\nThe SEC isn\'t accusing Kik of fraud, Mr. Livingston said. Rather, its enforcement division believes Kik failed to register the sale with the SEC and thus didn\'t give investors the proper information. That can\'t happen until the SEC\'s commissioners vote on the matter, and it is unclear if they\'ve done so.\n\nMr. Livingston founded Kik In 2009, fresh off a stint at BlackBerry creator Research In Motion. Following a legal dispute with RIM, Mr. Livingston reinvented the music-sharing app into a chat-based social network.\n\nEarly investors included venture firms RRE Ventures and Union Square Ventures. The app quickly amassed millions of users but never gained enough traction to compete with social-media giants such as Facebook Inc.\n\nMr. Livingston devised kin as a way to monetize the Kik platform. Developers and Kik users could earn kin for building apps and completing tasks like answering surveys. The company created 10 trillion kin tokens, selling one trillion publicly. Six trillion went to a newly formed nonprofit foundation, and three trillion were retained by the company.\n\nOstensibly, Kik\'s existing shareholders would profit if and when the value of kin rose.\n\nKik says from the start it marketed kin not as a security but as a "utility token" for developers and the foundation of a new ecosystem of apps and service, of which Kik would be one part.\n\nThe SEC has said that many tokens sold in 2017 and 2018 should have been classified as securities, which would have required their offerings to be registered with the agency. "I have yet to see an ICO that doesn\'t have a sufficient number of hallmarks of a security," SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in November 2017.\n\nThe SEC says most digital tokens are covered by a 73-year-old Supreme Court decision that defined which investments are considered securities. Many tokens meet the court\'s test because they can be traded for profit, and their value is tied to the performance of the startup that sold them, regulators say.\n\nIn a 39-page rebuttal on Dec. 10 to the SEC, Kik argued the sale terms, in fact, don\'t constitute an investment contract, and investors weren\'t led to expect to profit on their purchase of kin.\n\n"Bringing the proposed enforcement action against Kik and the foundation would amount to doubling down on a deeply flawed regulatory and enforcement approach," the company\'s lawyers wrote, according to copy of the rebuttal reviewed by the Journal.\n\nHowever it is classified, kin hasn\'t been a moneymaker for its holders. In January 2018, shortly after being distributed to buyers, kin traded at a record high of $0.001, according to CoinMarketCap. They are currently changing hands at $0.00003.\n\nDwindling  \x18Debt Cushions\' Threaten Safety of Leveraged Loans\n\nBy Sam Goldfarb\n\nMore companies with low credit ratings "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dwindling-debt-cushions-threaten-safety-of-leveraged-loans-11548421200" their borrowing to loans that would be repaid first in a bankruptcy, a trend that stands to undermine loans\' reputation as a safe investment.\n\nAt the end of last year, roughly 27% of first-lien loans \x14the most senior type of debt that is typically held by investors \x14were backed by companies that didn\'t have junior debt outstanding, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. That was the largest share in records going back to 2007, up from 26% in 2017 and 18% in 2007, at the height of the last economic expansion.\n\nThe presence of more junior debt is often referred to as a "debt cushion" for investors in first-lien loans. Junior bonds and loans typically absorb losses first in a bankruptcy, while senior lenders typically get most or all of their money back.\n\nThe math works this way. If a bankrupt company with $5 billion of unsecured bonds and $10 billion of first-lien loans were determined to be worth $10 billion, for example, bondholders would be completely wiped out, while the loan holders would get all their money back.\n\nBut if the same company had $15 billion of loans and no bonds, loan investors would get back only 67 cents on the dollar.\n\nThe shift to more "senior" loan sales comes as investors are grappling with how safe fixed-income investments are after a decade of heavy issuance. During the next economic downturn, many analysts expect loan recoveries to be lower than the historical average, in part because of shrinking debt cushions.\n\nBusinesses aren\'t legally bound to protect lenders by issuing more-junior debt. Their ability to borrow via first-lien loans is determined by the level of demand from investors and the terms of their existing credit agreements, which typically limit the amount of secured debt they can issue.\n\nThinner debt cushions are the direct result of loans\' outsize popularity in recent years. As investors have flocked to loans, drawn by floating-rate coupons that rise when the Federal Reserve is lifting short-term interest rates, credit terms have eased, ensuring a steady flow of new debt.\n\nOnline ticket vendor Vivid Seats in June raised $115 million by adding to its existing first-lien loan, to largely pay down its $185 million second-lien loan. Despite the increasing risk for first-lien lenders, the company made no change to the loan\'s interest rate, which was more than 5 percentage points below its more junior loan, according to LevFin Insights.\n\nSuch transactions can be frustrating to investors.\n\n"As a lender, when you look behind you, there should be something there," said George Goudelias, a senior portfolio manager and head of leveraged finance at Seix Investment Advisors LLC.\n\nLast year, buyers of first-lien loans were paid 0.83 percentage point above the benchmark London interbank offered rate for every multiple the loans exceeded a measure of borrowers\' cash flow, according to LCD. That was the smallest amount since 2007, when lenders were paid just 0.69 percentage point.\n\nAppetite for leveraged loans dropped off toward the end of last year as investors retreated from riskier assets. But there has been a rebound this month, with loans rallying in the secondary market and companies returning to the market to issue new debt.\n\nCredit Risk Falls, but Banks Need to Watch Leveraged Lending\n\nCredit risk improved last year for banks\' syndicated loan portfolios, but the positive trend was marred by a rise in leveraged lending, regulators say in their annual review of large, complex loans known as the Shared National Credit Program. The number of loans that weren\'t in good standing decreased to 6.7% in 2018, from 9.7% in 2017, regulators say. But meanwhile, leveraged loans, which are made to highly indebted companies, comprised a large majority of those bad loans and rose more than 18%. "The review finds increased risks associated with leveraged lending," said the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in a statement. "The agencies remind banks to update credit risk management practices as the risk profile of borrowers and the industry changes."
