BB&T

SunTrust Deal Gets

Regulators' Backing

Financial regulators approved the merger of regional lenders BB&T Corp. and SunTrust Banks Inc., the largest bank deal since the financial crisis.

The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. both said Tuesday they approved of the deal.

BB&T and SunTrust -- based in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Atlanta respectively -- unveiled plans earlier this year to combine in an attempt to better invest in technology. The combined company will be called Truist Financial Corp. and be based in Charlotte, N.C.

While the Fed approved the deal, it issued a consent order against SunTrust and said the company "made misleading or inaccurate statements" to business customers regarding add-on products from 2013 through 2017. The regulator said the company has ended these practices and repaid customers about $8.8 million in fees. The FDIC approved the combination, but its approval is dependent on the combined bank divesting 30 branches and $2.4 billion in deposits, it said.

BB&T Chief Executive Kelly King will be Truist's CEO. SunTrust CEO William Rogers will take over as chief executive in 2021. Until then, Mr. Rogers will be president and operating chief.

APPROACH RESOURCES

Texas Energy Firm

Files for Bankruptcy

Approach Resources Inc. filed for bankruptcy, the latest in a string of chapter 11 filings by financially distressed oil-and-gas drilling companies.

Fort Worth, Texas-based Approach said it would explore a restructuring of its balance sheet, a going-concern sale of its business and other alternatives while under chapter 11 protection. The company has drilling operations in West Texas, having acquired oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin since 2004.

Approach reported revenue of about $14.7 million and a loss of approximately $13.6 million for the second quarter.

The company reported total debt obligations of $407.2 million, according to papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston.

Approach's business, like many other U.S. oil and gas producers, has been affected "by the prolonged and continuing period of commodity price decline and subsequent volatility," President and CEO Sergei Krylov said in a declaration filed in court.

Mr. Krylov said the company has attempted to weather industry headwinds through layoffs, cost cutting and "substantial reductions" in its drilling program.

URBAN COMPASS

Artificial-Intelligence

Company Is Acquired

Urban Compass Inc., a SoftBank-backed real-estate brokerage company, said it had acquired an artificial-intelligence startup to help improve the buying and selling process for its agents and their clients.

The company, known as Compass, said it purchased New York-based Detectica Inc. last month for an undisclosed sum. It is the first AI-related acquisition for Compass, which touts the online tools it has developed to help agents produce pitching materials and communicate with clients about listings.

Detectica has developed machine-learning tools for Compass that produce listing recommendations for home seekers, based partly on other listings they bookmarked; that speed up the listing-creation process for agents by automatically populating new listings with known property information; and that detect anomalies and likely mistakes in real-estate data for property taxes, previous sale prices, bedroom and bathroom counts and more.

Since July, however, Detectica has been working exclusively with Compass, whose business model functions much like legacy firms, with commission rates for agents.

Data hacks and big fines drive cyber insurance growth

Insurers view digital security as a chance to expand despite uncertainty over risks

Data breaches can be expensive   just ask Marriott. The hotel group said last November that hackers had been accessing its database since 2014, compromising up to 339m guest records.

Since then it has incurred $100m costs relating to the hack and that is before a potential 99m fine levied under EU rules.

However, the effect has been cushioned by insurance policies, which have paid out $102m to the company.

Cyber cover is one of the fastest growing parts of the insurance industry. High profile data breaches and ransomware attacks   such as the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks in 2017   have convinced companies they need protection.

 NotPetya was a huge trigger for buying outside the US as [companies] saw what business interruption really looks like,  says Sarah Stephens, the cyber, media and technology practice leader at insurance broker Marsh JLT Specialty.

Cyber insurance dates back to the 1990s when a growing number of ecommerce companies sought to protect themselves from the risk that hackers would take down their websites.

The growth more recently has been led by the US, where data protection regulations and fines for data breaches have convinced companies to buy insurance.

That trend is spreading to Europe where the GDPR data rules that came into force last year are expected to lead to a wave of fines   for example, British Airways has been provisionally fined 183m for a data breach in 2018.

It is unclear whether fines can be covered by insurance under EU law but brokers say that the potential penalties faced by BA and Marriott have raised awareness about the risks involved in data breaches.

The other growth market is small and medium-sized enterprises. Brokers say that penetration is still low but that given their smaller resources these companies are particularly vulnerable to a cyber attack.

 We are seeing more and more take-up, particularly in industries where we see a data breach risk such as retailers, healthcare, anyone dealing with data analytics and companies that work with big, global firms,  says Ms Stephens.

Cyber insurance policies pay out to customers that have suffered an attack, much as a normal insurance policy would. But there is often also a service element to the product that provides practical help to customers whose systems have been attacked.

These services can include forensic investigators to probe the causes and offer solutions, public relations experts to deal with reputational damage and even expert negotiators to deal with ransom demands and arrange for their payment, often via bitcoin.

Insurance companies see cyber as a rare opportunity for growth and have rushed into the market. Almost 200 insurers offer cyber cover in the US, while the global market for cyber insurance is expected to grow from about $6bn of premiums a year to $15bn by 2022, according to RBC Capital Markets.

But that growth could carry a high cost for insurance companies.

While there are sophisticated models in place for known risks such as floods and storms, cyber risks are different.

 Cyber modelling is still very much in its infancy,  says Rebecca Bole, head of industry engagement at CyberCube, a cyber modelling specialist.  It is a very different peril to weather-related perils, where the science is documented and well understood. Cyber is a man-made peril, which creates a lot of complexity. 

Insurers and modellers have to grapple with the ever-changing nature of cyber attacks, along with uncertainty over who the perpetrators are, what they want, how much damage they could cause and how quickly the effect of an attack could spread around the globe.

 We know more about [catastrophe risk] than we do about cyber,  Brian Duperreault, chief executive of insurer AIG, said at a recent Financial Times/PwC insurance summit.  The bad guys have a better research and development department than we do. 

He said there was strong demand for cover from AIG customers.  Every client faces cyber [threats]   it is the biggest single global risk we face. 

The possible cost of large scale attacks are eye-watering. CyberCube and Guy Carpenter, an insurance broker, modelled scenarios that could cause big losses for the industry. An extended outage at a large cloud services provider could lead to $14.3bn in payouts, for example, while a widespread theft from an email service provider could result in losses of $19.1bn.

Lloyd s of London, the insurance market, has also assessed the cost of a large-scale cyber attack. It recently estimated that a single attack on Asian ports in which a computer virus scrambled cargo records could lead to $110bn economic damage   equivalent to half the 2018 global loss from natural catastrophes   with only 8 per cent covered by insurance policies.

 There is a recognition that this is a huge growth area for the insurance industry,  says Ms Bole.  More and more enterprises will be looking for risk transfer.

Good day. A string of venture investments in startups building analytics software for commercial drones underscores a shift away from competitively challenged hardware startups and toward software firms in the drone industry.

"It has been a horrible market for investing," Signia Venture Partners Managing Director Ed Cluss said about drone hardware startups. "Data analytics and insight is really where it's at."

Pensa Systems Inc., which provides drone software used to take pictures and video of store shelves to generate inventory insights, is expected on Tuesday to announce $10 million in seed funding led by Signia and ATX Venture Partners. Last week, DroneDeploy Inc. raised $35 million for its drone software, which generates business insights in industries like agriculture.

The bets come after Chinese drone makers drove down prices and drove several U.S. startups out of business. For instance, Aria Insights shut down earlier this year, and Airware folded last year. Bessemer Venture Partners partner David Cowan, who led DroneDeploy's funding last week, is optimistic about drone-related analytics software. As the Federal Aviation Administration eases restrictions, more use cases will put software in higher demand, he said.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Neurological disease. Neuroscience drug startup Rodin Therapeutics Inc. has agreed to be acquired by Alkermes PLC for up to $950 million, showing the continued strong interest among pharmaceutical companies in attacking dementia and other neurological diseases, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports.

* The deal comes after Biogen Inc. passed on its previous option to buy the startup. It is another example of biotech startups' ability to find an acquisition after their previous buyout options with a different corporation weren't exercised.

* Alkermes is paying $100 million up front and could pay $850 million more if clinical, regulatory and sales goals are met.

* Boston-based Rodin had granted Biogen an option, through a 2016 research collaboration, to pay up to $485 million in upfront and contingent payments, Rodin said at the time.

'Starter children.' The pet-food startup sector continues to grow, and a new celebrity-backed company is the latest example, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports. Los Angeles-based Jinx Inc., which has secured $5.6 million from venture-capital and celebrity investors including Initialized Capital, actor Will Smith and musician Nas, officially kicked off its line of dog food this week. The company hopes to stand out in the crowded field by catering to the modern millennial dog owner, whose pet is treated more like a child than an animal, said Terri Rockovich, Jinx's co-founder and chief executive. "Dogs are not carnivorous fools. They are members of our family and their lifestyles have changed," Ms. Rockovich said.

PE allocation. With its private-equity portfolio shrinking, the California Public Employees' Retirement System is looking at ways to pump it back up, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming reports. The public pension plan, which with almost $379 billion under management is the nation's largest, is aiming to restart a co-investment program, expand its roster of fund managers and use more separate accounts as part of its goal to invest up to $10 billion a year in private equity.

Rideshare deal. Israeli startup Gett said it struck a partnership with Lyft Inc. to expand its U.S. footprint and is shutting its New York ride-sharing business Juno, The Wall Street Journal reports, the latest sign of consolidation in an industry facing mounting regulation from state and local governments. Venture-backed Gett acquired Juno in 2017 in a $200 million equity-based deal. Gett blamed Juno's demise on "misguided regulations in New York City earlier this year."

AI acquisition. Urban Compass Inc., a SoftBank-backed real-estate brokerage company, has acquired an artificial-intelligence startup to help improve the buying and selling process for its agents and their clients, Jared Council reports for WSJ Pro Articifial Intelligence. The company, known as Compass, said it purchased New York-based Detectica Inc. last month for an undisclosed sum. It is the first AI-related acquisition for Compass.

Exits

The deal is expected to close by year-end.

Alphabet Inc.'s Google acquired enterprise cloud platform CloudSimple for an undisclosed amount. The company was backed by M12.

VC Funds

Northzone closed its oversubscribed ninth fund at $500 million. Northzone IX LP will make mostly Series A and Series B investments, along with a few seed financings, in consumer and enterprise startups across Europe and the U.S. East Coast. So far, the fund has invested in Pollen, Spacemaker and Livepeer. In addition to the new fund, Northzone promoted Wendy Xiao Schadeck and Chris Steinau to principal, and Henrik Grim to investment manager. The firm has offices in London, Stockholm, New York and Oslo.

OpenView Venture Partners seeks to raise $450 million for its sixth fund, according to a regulatory filing. The Boston-based firm's portfolio includes leasing and asset management platform View the Space Inc. and customer experience technology company UserTesting.

Seed investor Unusual Ventures raised $400 million for its second fund. Limited partners include colleges and universities, foundations, endowments, and health-related institutions. Recent investments the firm has participated in include Styra Inc., Winnie and Shujinko. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm launched last year with a $160 million inaugural fund.

London-based MMC Ventures launched its latest fund with 100 million ($110.7 million) to provide expansion capital to later-stage portfolio companies. MMC Scale Up Fund will also participate in secondary transactions. The London-based firm launched a 52 million seed fund earlier this year.

None of the people scheduled to speak at the hearing actually currently work at a private-equity firm.

Meanwhile, in this morning's top news, Chris Cumming reports on how the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest state pension fund manager, is considering how it can pump more capital into its private-equity portfolio as it tries to reach its 8% target to the asset class. Also, Luis Garcia has details of Sightway Capital's first fund, which wrapped up with $1.2 billion, and I have news on NexPhase Capital's newest deal.

Yahoo Japan seals 1.3tn Line deal

? SoftBank-backed merger forms AI powerhouse ? Combination still dwarfed by Facebook-backed merger forms AI powerhouse ? Combination still dwarfed by

SoftBank-backed Yahoo Japan and messaging app Line have agreed to merge as Masayoshi Son seeks to create a $30bn south-east Asian powerhouse in data and artificial intelligence.

The deal follows a long courtship by Mr Son, SoftBank's founder, who sees the merger as a way to compete against bigger groups in China and Silicon Valley, say people familiar with the talks. The deal values Line at 1.3tn ($12bn), creating a group with a combined market value of 3.3tn. The group's $11bn combined revenue would put it above domestic rival Rakuten with access to a growing number of mobile users in south-east Asia.

Analysts have regularly made the case for a merger, saying that a deal would give Line and Yahoo Japan access to a bigger pool of data and stronger negotiating power with its advertisers. It also strengthens Yahoo Japan's presence in the mobile space by giving it access to Line's 164m monthly active users in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.

The merger allows Line to join Soft-Bank's ecosystem and benefit from its investment in AI and other technologies via the $100bn Vision Fund.

"We were driven by a sense of crisis about global competition and the pace of change in AI," Takeshi Idezawa, cochief executive at Line, said in Tokyo. "The timing arrived for us to move on to the next phase [with this merger]."

Masaru Sugiyama, Goldman Sachs analyst, cautioned that Line and Yahoo Japan combined would still be "far smaller" than Rakuten in terms of transaction value of their digital payments services.

The two groups together would also be dwarfed by Facebook, Amazon and China's Tencent in every measure from revenue, market value and research budget.

Makoto Kikuchi, chief investment officer at Myojo Asset Management, said: "Line can't compete alone in this space. There is really no other option."

Under the framework announced yesterday, Line will be taken private through a tender offer at a proposed price of 5,200 a share, which represents a 13 per cent premium to the messaging app's price on November 13 before news of the talks broke.

Z Holdings, a subsidiary of SoftBank's telecoms arm formerly known as Yahoo Japan, and Naver, the South Korean internet search group that owns 73 per cent of Line, plan to each spend 170bn on the tender offer.

Funds  holdings and  design flaws  vulnerable to market downturn prompt concern

Junk bond exchange traded funds are being short sold in bulk. Almost 40 per cent of the US s biggest junk bond ETFs available for borrowing are on loan to short sellers, according to data from FIS Astec Analytics, far more than for other kinds of ETF.

Such short selling has raised alarm about the quality of the funds  holdings. It has also prompted the question of whether junk bond ETFs have design flaws that could wreak havoc if market conditions deteriorate.

Junk bond ETFs   which buy bonds with low, or  junk , credit ratings   have surged in popularity thanks to a decade of low interest rates. They hold more than $60bn in assets, according to database manager Ultumus.

Yet their underlying holdings are extremely illiquid   in some cases completely illiquid   and there is no guarantee that they will trade at fair value in a downturn. This poses less of a risk for institutional short-sellers, but retail investors would feel the sting in the event of any failure.

The heavy shorting has been carried out mainly by professional traders, such as hedge funds, which have come to use ETFs in place of trading junk bonds directly. Their flight to ETFs is largely a result of banking regulations introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, which required them to increase the amount of equity they hold substantially when dealing in high-yield debts.

Tougher regulations have meant some bond markets have seen less trading activity in 2019 than in 2007, a review by Greenwich Associates has found. Junk bonds, due to their higher risk, have been especially hard hit.

Garth Friesen, chief executive of hedge fund III Capital, says investors hoping to short sell junk bonds have three options: ETFs, swaps and the credit default swap index.

At present, Mr Friesen says, hedge funds may prefer ETFs to swaps as the latter are becoming more expensive. The high price of swaps shows up in what traders call a  basis , which measures the difference in price between bonds and swaps.  It is not just in high yield but also in investment grade. The cash markets are trading very cheap relative to the derivative markets. 

Issuers have welcomed institutions short selling their junk bond ETFs as the large volumes traded help drive assets into the funds. This creates more revenue for issuers, which charge fees on total assets managed.

Matthew Bartolini, head of research at SPDR Americas, says institutions prefer short selling ETFs that are big and popular because they tend to be easier to trade.  You don t see a lot of short interest on unsuccessful products,  he says.  A $5m ETF that s newly launched doesn t get a lot of short interest. 

As such, ETF issuers can in some way take it as a form of flattery when institutions choose to short their ETFs.  It is confirmation that this is a strong product that has industrial strength,  Mr Bartolini says.

But some critics see institutional short selling in a sinister light. Prominent investors argue that junk bond ETFs are flawed because of the way in which they are constructed.

Academics have given some backing to this view. A recent study led by Yao Zeng, a professor of finance at the University of Washington, found that bond dealers were using junk bond ETFs as a way to package and dump junk bonds they could not sell elsewhere. This dumping could make ETFs trade at the wrong price, the study found, particularly in times of heightened volatility.

Critics have also argued that there is a  liquidity mismatch  between junk bond ETFs, which trade cheaply and smoothly, and the junk bonds that they track, some of which hardly trade at all. This mismatch could be a problem, the critics claim, because ETFs depend on junk bond trading in order to stay fairly priced   and some short selling interest may be the result of an anticipated failure caused by these flaws.

This argument chimes with that of Vanguard, the world s second-largest ETF provider. While Vanguard provides several bond ETFs, it has declined to provide a junk bond one. It cites the high cost and difficulty trading junk bonds as obstacles.

But liquidity mismatches are not confined to ETFs. Crises at Woodford Investment Management, GAM and Natixis-owned H2O have shown that they affect traditional mutual funds.

Dave Abner, author of trading manual The ETF Handbook, says liquidity mismatches can in fact cause more problems for mutual funds than ETFs.  You can have huge problems with mutual funds where nobody knows what they hold and they re forced sellers when they need to raise funds,  Mr Abner says.

It is far from clear, therefore, that short bets on ETFs are being made because of liquidity mismatches: shorting junk bonds is expensive because short-sellers must pay rental fees to the stock lender that owns the assets and cover any missed coupons. This means any short-seller anticipating a blow-up needs accurate timing or the wager could backfire.

There is a host of other factors that could impel managers to take short bets. These include a negative view on the credit quality of the underlying junk bonds, an assumption that credit spreads may widen, or to hedge other investments.

For now, junk bond ETFs only make up a small slice of the $1.2tn high yield market. But given the stunning speed at which bond ETFs have grown this year, finding a resolution   and soon   could be crucial.

VC Daily: Biotechs Find Deals After Buyout Options Fade; Bill.com Files for IPO; Private Equity's Role in 2020 Election

Good day. When biotech companies started signing acquisition-option deals earlier this decade, some industry watchers were skeptical. Among other questions, there was a concern that if a large corporation in such a deal decided to pass on a buyout, that could send a negative message to the market about the smaller partner. But that didn't appear to happen in two recent deals.

Plus, Deval Patrick's presidential ambitions are likely to put Bain Capital in the spotlight again, after its co-founder Mitt Romney brought Bain attention (and criticism) in the 2012 race. Venture capital sometimes gets lumped together with private equity by politicians, so it will be interesting to see if Mr. Patrick's run brings any additional scrutiny to venture capital.

Plus, the recent slowdown in initial public offerings hasn't stopped Bill.com Holdings Inc. from moving ahead with filing for its initial public offering.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Option deals. There is life for a biotechnology startup after a corporate partner passes on its option to buy the company. Despite concerns by some observers about the potential negative effects of a corporate partner passing on its purchase option, this week Roche Holding AG and Merck & Co. each snapped up biotech businesses after they were passed over by corporations that previously secured options to acquire them, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports.

* Roche is buying Promedior Inc., which in 2015 granted an acquisition option to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Meanwhile, Merck snapped up Calporta Therapeutics Inc., which formed in 2015 through a collaboration between Avalon Ventures and GlaxoSmithKline PLC signed in 2013 to launch biotech startups.

* GSK had an option to acquire companies started through this deal and purchased one of the eight that launched, buying celiac-disease startup Sitari Pharma in September. The Avalon-GSK collaboration ended a few weeks ago, according to Avalon Managing Director Jay Lichter.

* Acquisition-option agreements gained popularity early this decade. They can benefit startups and corporations, said Brian Goldstein, co-chair of the business and technology group at the Boston law firm Choate Hall & Stewart LLP, who has worked on these deals.

IPO filing. Bill.com Holdings Inc. on Friday filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company provides software to help small and midsize businesses with back-office financial operations. Bill.com said it has more than 81,000 customers and more than 1.8 million network members, which it defined as customers plus those customers' suppliers and clients. Major shareholders include DCM with 16% of shares, August Capital with 13%, Ossa Investments with 9.1%, Emergence Capital with 8.1%, Financial Partners Fund with 7.8%, Scale Venture Partners with 6.2% and Icon Ventures with 5.7%.

Beyond China. As TikTok faces mounting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and regulators, some employees and advisers in recent weeks have approached senior executives to suggest ways the company could rebrand, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the discussions.

Some investors in TikTok parent company ByteDance Ltd., including Sequoia Capital and SoftBank Group Corp., view growth in the U.S. as key to achieving their goal of a public offering late next year, people familiar with the matter said.

New fund. HarbourVest Partners has wrapped up fundraising for its fifth co-investment fund amid rising competition from institutional investors and funds pursuing the strategy, WSJ Pro's Ted Bunker reports. The Boston-based firm, among the pioneers of co-investing in private equity, collected $3 billion for its HarbourVest Partners Co-Investment Fund V. That is 71% more than it brought in for the strategy's predecessor fund, which raised $1.75 billion and closed in 2017.

Bunker's Take: Bain Capital Headed for Second Act as Political Football

By Ted Bunker

Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, hasn't done private-equity firm Bain Capital any favors by entering the Democratic presidential race.

First, he is exiting his role as co-head of the Boston-based firm's Double Impact fund, which he helped start, just as it is raising its sophomore pool. But Mr. Patrick also has virtually guaranteed his former employer will take center stage as the debate over reining in billionaires heats up on the hustings.

Bain Capital has been to this fight before. Co-founder Mitt Romney, now a Republican senator from Utah, took plenty of heat over his role in private equity during the 2012 presidential race. But today's environment is far more caustic, and the recent string of private equity-backed retail bankruptcies can only add to the bitter flavor.

High-yield debt Bulk short selling prompts question of whether 'flaws' could wreak market havoc, writes David Tuckwell

Junk bond exchange traded funds are being short sold in bulk. Almost 40 per cent of the US's biggest junk bond ETFs available for borrowing are on loan to short sellers, according to data from FIS Astec Analytics, far more than for other kinds of ETF.

SoftBank signs $30bn deal between Yahoo Japan and Line

Tie-up aimed at creating a south-east Asia powerhouse in data and AI

SoftBank-backed Yahoo Japan and messaging app Line have agreed to merge as Masayoshi Son seeks to create a south-east Asian powerhouse in data and artificial intelligence worth 3.3tn ($30bn).

The deal follows a long courtship of Line by Mr Son, SoftBank s founder, who has long pitched the merger as a way to compete against bigger groups in China and Silicon Valley, according to people familiar with the discussions.

The merger, which is expected to be completed in October 2020, values Line at 1.3tn, creating a group with a combined market value of 3.3tn.The group s $11bn in combined revenue would put it above domestic rival Rakuten with access to a growing number of mobile users in south-east Asia.

Analysts have often called for the two groups to combine, saying a deal would give Line and Yahoo Japan access to a bigger pool of data and stronger negotiating power with its advertisers.

It also strengthens Yahoo Japan s presence in the mobile space by giving it access to Line s 164m monthly active users in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.

For WhatsApp rival Line, the merger allows it to join SoftBank s ecosystem and benefit from its investment in AI and other technologies through the $100bn Vision Fund.

 We were driven by a sense of crisis about global competition and the pace of change in AI,  Takeshi Idezawa, co-chief executive at Line, said at a joint press conference in Tokyo.  The timing arrived for us to move on to the next phase [with this merger]. 

Following news of the deal, CLSA raised its target price on Line to 7,500 from 5,000, saying the combination made  perfect sense .

Goldman Sachs analyst Masaru Sugiyama cautioned that Line and Yahoo Japan combined would still be  far smaller  than Rakuten in terms of transaction value of their digital payments services. The two groups together would also be dwarfed by Facebook, Amazon and China s Tencent in every measure from revenue, market value and research budget.

Makoto Kikuchi, chief investment officer at Myojo Asset Management, said:  Line can t compete alone in this space. There is really no other option. 

Under the framework announced on Monday, Line will first be taken private through a tender offer at a proposed price of 5,200a share, which represents a 13 per cent premium to the messaging app s share price on November 13 before news of the talks broke last week.

Z Holdings, a subsidiary of SoftBank s telecoms arm formerly known as Yahoo Japan, and Naver, the South Korean internet search group that owns 73 per cent of Line, plan to each spend 170bn on the tender offer.

The multi-tiered tie-up will involve SoftBank s telecoms arm, which owns a 45 per cent stake in Z Holdings, creating a 50-50 joint venture with Naver. After the merger, Z Holdings will remain a listed entity, which will become a consolidated subsidiary of SoftBank s telecoms arm.

Following a surge last week, shares in Z Holdings rose 1.2 per cent on Monday after the deal was formally announced, while Line climbed 2.2 per cent. Shares in SoftBank s telecoms arm fell 0.3 per cent and Naver gained 2.9 per cent.

Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley advised Z Holdings, while Line was advised by JPMorgan. Mizuho advised SoftBank s telecoms arm, and Naver was advised by Deutsche.

Vijay Sankaran, chief information officer at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., is betting that artificial intelligence-powered customer service and personalization will help it stand out from competitors.

The Omaha, Neb.-based brokerage firm, which has about 12 million client accounts, is using AI to drive customized experiences for investors. "We want to be more of a Netflix-style or Spotify-style personalization engine for digital investing," Mr. Sankaran said. TD Ameritrade's competitors include not only traditional brokerages, but also upstarts like robo advisers and new trading apps.

The company launched an AI-powered tool this month that sends investors personalized emails, including tailored educational resources, based on their clicks on the TD Ameritrade website, their customer profile and their investor portfolio.

Before, investors would get generic marketing emails that would often be unrelated to their particular investment strategy, Mr. Sankaran said.

The tool was created by a team of eight AI experts at the company. Building AI tools in house is preferable to working with a vendor because they need to be customized specifically for the financial sector, Mr. Sankaran said.

The same AI engine also identifies news articles from outside sources that might make a particular company's stock price move up or down and affect a TD Ameritrade investor's portfolio. The articles appear as notifications that clients see within the TD Ameritrade platform.

Technology executives across industries feel a sense of urgency to compete against digital giants that place a premium on customer experience, Chris Howard, chief of research at Gartner Inc.'s CIO Research group, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jetblue-to-take-customer-service-tech-to-the-skies-11569968137". "Everybody wants the Amazon experience," he said.

Within the next two years, Mr. Sankaran predicts AI will have an even bigger role in customer service. The eight-person team is now working on an AI engine called "voice of the customer analytics," which builds on AI-based text and voice chatbots the company launched in 2017. The algorithm is trained on anonymized email, voice and chat transcripts between customers and human agents and it classifies the intent of those calls, Mr. Sankaran said.

The goal is to develop an AI-based voice assistant that can handle requests by phone, going beyond simple password resets and trade status queries, already possible with today's technology. For example, such a tool could provide all of the necessary forms for a complex transaction such as a rollover, where a customer reinvests funds from a security that has reached maturity into a new, similar security, Mr. Sankaran said.

Deploying such an assistant would mean the company wouldn't need to hire more customer-service agents, even as its client base grows, Mr. Sankaran said. Agents could help clients with more interesting questions, such as those related to trading and investment strategies.

Technology executives at many firms have said the big value in AI comes when it is paired with human workers, in what is known as "AI augmentation." In 2021, AI augmentation is expected to generate $2.9 trillion in business value, up from $1.6 trillion this year, according to Gartner.

The longest bull market in U.S. history has helped many retirees build savings while reducing the risk that they'll outlive their money.

But gathering assets is just half the battle. A smart investment strategy also means continuing to enlarge a nest egg and taking steps to ensure it can weather the next big downturn, financial professionals say.

The Wall Street Journal's latest "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-survey-economists-split-on-causes-of-hiring-slowdown-11573138800?mod=hp_major_pos3" of economic forecasters, released earlier this month, showed a slight easing in predictions of a recession occurring in the next 12 months: seen as a 30.2% probability, down from 34.2% in the survey results from October. Still, taken with concerns about the long bull market and recent trade disputes between the U.S., China and the European Union, this might be a good time to review a portfolio, particularly for investors relying on their assets for income.

Below, we've shared five possible actions to help safeguard, and increase, a retirement investment portfolio in the next downturn.

Some investors, of course, aren't particularly worried about a possible recession or a bear market. If you find yourself among this group, ask yourself the following three questions: Is your portfolio dominated by hot stocks and high-yield funds? Are you short on assets that could be easily tapped for cash during a market pullback? Do you own certain investments that made more sense under conditions that have since changed?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you, too, could be in need of the advice that follows:

Move up, not out

It is natural to want to sell when stocks are up after a long market run, especially if that run is starting to look a little tired. But even now, when many stocks are richly valued, the market could crawl higher for some time, buoyed by the economy's momentum and Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, says Wasif Latif, head of investments at the VictoryShares unit of San Antonio-based Victory Capital Management Inc. And if there are more gains, Mr. Latif says, investors who exited would miss out.

Instead of slashing holdings, Mr. Latif suggests replacing some stocks with others that could prove more resilient in a downdraft notably quality stocks that trade at reasonable valuations and carry steady or growing dividends.

ETFs that aim for such holdings, says Todd Rosenbluth, who heads fund research at data-provider CFRA, include iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (QUAL), which focuses on large-cap and midcap stocks with strong financial measures, such as earnings growth and low debt; and O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (OUSA), which holds shares of low-volatility, large-cap and midcap companies with strong financial performance.

Check the price tag

Broadly speaking, U.S. stocks are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 20. Growth stocks, which have outpaced the rest of the market recently, are significantly higher, with many P/E ratios in the 20s or above, says Greg Powell, deputy chief investment officer at Woodstock, N.Y.-based Miller/Howard Investments. If the economy hits a soft patch, Mr. Powell warns, stocks trading at loftier valuations and funds or ETFs that own them could underperform.

Mr. Powell suggests investors visit the websites of fund firms to check the P/E ratios of funds or ETFs they own. If they are mostly above the broad market's valuation, an investor could bring down the overall P/E ratio of their portfolio by adding a fund or ETF that focuses on value stocks, which are those believed to be undervalued by the market in comparison with comparable stocks.

Because value stocks have lagged,"there is a lot of value in value," says Carlton Neel, chief executive of Chaikin Analytics, a Philadelphia-based equity research and ratings firm.

Consider the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (IWS), which has a P/E of about 17 and yields about 2%, says Mr. Neel. Another option might be Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR), which gets high marks from Morningstar Inc.

Get less stress

Those who worry about market gyrations might look closely at how the equities portion of a portfolio is doing compared with a benchmark such as the S&P 500, says Robert Steen, advice director at USAA. That could help flag any missteps by retirees managing their own accounts or confirm that the investors are doing a good job, Mr. Steen says.

Another move might be using the analysis tool on an online brokerage site to see how a portfolio is allocated and whether the asset mix is appropriate for someone with that person's investment goals.

Retirees who lack other income sources also need to maintain liquidity by holding some cash and cash-equivalents that can be tapped easily to meet expenses, Mr. Steen notes. Depending on the situation, a person may need to hold as much as a year's worth of expenses in such assets.

It might be worth adding a conservative short-term ETF such as Schwab Short-term U.S. Treasury (SCHO) or Vanguard Short-term Treasury (VGSH), which each yield around 1.6% and charge expenses of 0.06% and 0.07%, respectively. While ETFs don't guarantee principal stability, such funds might hold up well during big stock selloffs, since government bonds are considered a safer haven.

Weed the garden

A portfolio can get unruly if an investor hasn't periodically trimmed rapidly growing positions, says Jordan Kaufman, a wealth adviser in Ridgewood, N.J. There may be a strongly appreciated holding of stock from a former employer. Sometimes investors become enamored with one market sector and load up on it, he adds.

"Anytime you own too much in one sector, you're exposing yourself to more risk," he says.

A more balanced approach, he says, might be to own some stocks or ETFs in each of the 11 market areas represented in the S&P 500 index. If each one represented around 9% of the portfolio's equities value, they all would be approximately equal in weighting. This could have the benefit of reducing individual sector risk and potentially lowering the volatility of an investor's equity holdings materially, Mr. Kaufman says.

Diversify the defense

Traditionally, amid worries about an economic downturn, investors have flocked to stocks considered defensive, such as consumer-staples producers and utilities. But many people have done that already, boosting valuations there. Moreover, these sectors might not give a retiree enough long-term appreciation to keep pace with inflation, says Mr. Powell of Miller/Howard.

It might make sense to look elsewhere which, for less-experienced investors, might justify paying a little more in management fees and buying a conservative actively managed fund.

Among conservative funds that Morningstar rates highly are Mairs & Power Growth (MPGFX) and Jensen Quality Growth (JENSX), which focus on stocks with good growth potential and solid financials. They charge 0.64% and 0.87% of assets, respectively, in annual management fees. While less volatile funds might lag in rallies, they can offer better downside protection and steadier growth, analysts say.

Yahoo Japan and Chat App Line Agree to Merge; The companies say they aim to leverage each other's large user bases to expand their online businesses

TOKYO Internet portal Yahoo Japan Corp. and chat app Line said Monday they have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-japan-in-talks-over-combining-with-chat-app-line-11573661248" in a deal that includes a $3.1 billion buyout of Line Corp.'s minority shareholders.

Under the merger terms, a SoftBank Group Corp. subsidiary and Line parent Naver Corp. of South Korea will each hold 50% of a joint-venture company that in turn will control a holding company housing the operations of Yahoo Japan and Line. Media, including The Wall Street Journal, reported last week that the 50-50 arrangement was being studied.

The companies said they aimed to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-line-merger-plan-raises-hopes-for-japanese-super-app-11573726726", which include shopping and payment services as well as advertising-supported content. Line is the dominant chat app in Japan and says it has 82 million active monthly users.

The parties to the deal said they hoped to reach a final agreement next month. They said it would require various clearances from authorities.

As part of the deal, SoftBank Group subsidiary SoftBank Corp. and Naver said they would buy all the shares in Line not already owned by Naver at 5,200 ($47.78) a share. Naver owns 72.6% of Line as of Monday. SoftBank Corp. and Naver will pay 170 billion ($1.56 billion) each to buy those Line shares, SoftBank said.

They offered a 13.4% premium to Line's share price before last week's reports about the merger. In Tokyo trading, Line shares closed Monday up 2.2% at 5,150.

Under the plan, the company housing the operations of Yahoo Japan and Line will remain publicly listed. Kentaro Kawabe, chief executive of Yahoo Japan's parent, said the SoftBank-Naver joint venture would hold 65% of that company and the rest would be owned by minority shareholders.

The companies said after the merger they would aim to become "one of the world's leading artificial intelligence technology companies," applying AI to online marketing, e-commerce and digital payments.

Analysts say the merger could allow Yahoo Japan and Line to compete better against rivals in Japan, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google for advertising and Amazon.com Inc. for online shopping. However, competing outside Japan is likely to be harder because other companies already have dominant positions in major markets.

Six charts that lay bare what went wrong for Woodford

Stock-selection process and changes in investment style have affected the fund s returns since its launch

Neil Woodford went from  the man who can t stop making money  to unleashing Europe s biggest fund management scandal for a decade. Just over five years after overseeing Britain s most successful investment company launch, his business is in tatters and will close its doors in the coming weeks.

What went wrong for the UK s best-known stockpicker? Thousands of column inches have been dedicated to dissecting the reasons behind Mr Woodford s spectacular downfall since his flagship Equity Income fund was suspended in June. But for the first time a detailed data-driven analysis has revealed Mr Woodford s changes in style and stock-selection behaviour that led to Equity Income s collapse.

Stockopedia, the investment information provider, has crunched the numbers on Mr Woodford s portfolio decision-making over the past five years. FTfm presents a selection of charts that tell the story of one of the fund industry s biggest implosions.

Chart 1: Early commitment to quality and value

When Woodford Investment Management launched Equity Income in 2014, it was described internally as a  widows and orphans  fund   a product ordinary savers could invest in and sleep soundly at night, knowing their capital would be protected.

Mr Woodford built the portfolio accordingly. Under Stockopedia s definitions, the vast majority of the holdings were cheap and of good quality. The largest 20 were dominated by FTSE 100 companies   the types of businesses on which Mr Woodford built his reputation at Invesco. A third of the fund was invested in the top five stocks: AstraZeneca (8.3 per cent), GlaxoSmithKline (7.1 per cent), British American Tobacco (6.2 per cent), BT (6 per cent) and Imperial Tobacco (5.3 per cent).

Chart 2: Move towards speculative stocks

Within a couple of years Equity Income s make-up had changed dramatically. Mr Woodford appeared seduced by an increasing number of early-stage healthcare, technology and financial stocks. Going by Stockopedia s rankings, this meant a large proportion of the holdings were classed as expensive and of poorer quality.

While the fund s top five holdings were still blue-chips, several speculative companies made up the top 10. These included Prothena, a Nasdaq-listed biotech company, Allied Minds, a US intellectual property commercialisation business, Theravance Biopharma, a medicines maker, and Benevolent AI, an artificial intelligence company. Mr Woodford had clearly been influenced by the performance of a handful of small-cap companies, including Prothena, which returned 249 per cent in 2015 alone.

Chart 3: Small and unlisted companies start to dominate

When Equity Income launched more than three-quarters of the fund was invested in companies valued at more than 2.5bn, with less than 5 per cent in listed companies worth between 50m and 350m. Unlisted holdings and companies on which Stockopedia did not have any data were less than 10 per cent.

But over time this weighting changed dramatically. Large-caps dropped to a quarter of the portfolio, while unlisted and small-caps accounted for more than half. The switch started in 2017 when Mr Woodford faced a tide of outflows. To pay back fleeing investors, he was forced to sell the more liquid larger holdings, leaving an increasing rump of smaller and unlisted companies.

Chart 4: Investment style drifts

Throughout his quarter of a century at Invesco, Mr Woodford established a reputation as a contrarian investor who took big bets on large unloved companies, and made big calls on the direction of the economy. His style was understood and easy for financial advisers to explain to their clients.

But as Stockopedia s categorisation of his fund s holdings shows, his style fluctuated massively throughout his five years managing money solo. What began as a portfolio focused on large, quality companies, gradually switched to a fund with a heavy weighting to stocks more reliant on market trends. By the end, stocks defined as being undervalued dominated the fund.

Chart 5: Stock selection changes

Mr Woodford was known for his commitment to unfancied stocks, such as tobacco companies, and other makers of consumer products that provide consistent dividends regardless of the economy s health   known as consumer defensives. Mr Woodford duly loaded Equity Income up with these holdings, which accounted for 22 per cent of the portfolio at launch, compared with 15 per cent of the FTSE All Share.

But by 2019 consumer defensives had been replaced by consumer cyclicals, which represented 19 per cent of the fund compared with 11 per cent of the FTSE All Share. These companies, including housebuilders, are highly correlated with the domestic business cycle, which has been strangled by Brexit uncertainty.

Chart 6: Winners were sold, but losers kept

Having produced strong performance for its first two years, Equity Income began to trail its benchmark and peers significantly from 2017 onwards. In 2018 it lost 17.1 per cent and is down 22.8 per cent this year. Chronic underperformance was a result of Mr Woodford being forced to sell his best-performing companies to meet redemption requests, while holding on to underperforming hard-to-sell stocks.

Stockopedia s analysis shows that the vast majority of the companies Mr Woodford hung on to between 2016 and 2019 underperformed, while almost all of those he sold produced healthy returns. Over that period, 51 per cent of FTSE All Share companies produced positive returns, compared with just 27 per cent of Mr Woodford s holdings.

Good day. Federal Reserve officials came about as close as they could to putting a nail in the coffin of further rate cuts in comments Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and New York Fed leader John Williams both repeated that monetary policy is in a good place, and even Fed superdove James Bullard of the St. Louis Fed said he isn't looking for another easing right now. Fed Vice chairman Richard Clarida said the job market may be entering full employment territory. Outside the U.S., Mexico's central bank lowered interest rates, as expected, and the head of the Bank of Canada forecast a technology-driven period of creative destruction in the economy.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Top News

Powell Signals Optimism on Economy but Cites Trade Uncertainties

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was optimistic its interest-rate cuts this year would buoy the U.S. economy against lingering headwinds, including trade uncertainty and a slowdown in global growth. The U.S.-China trade conflict that escalated this summer has contributed to declines in domestic manufacturing activity, Mr. Powell told the House Budget Committee on Thursday.

"There are a number of factors that are contributing" to the slowdown. Trade is one of them. It's certainly not the whole story."

  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell

New York Fed's Williams Backs Keeping Rates Steady

New York Fed President John Williams echoed the views of many of his colleagues Thursday, saying that after three rate cuts, U.S. central-bank interest-rate policy is in the right place to deal with the current environment of uncertainty.

* Fed's Bullard: After Three Rate Cuts, It's Now Time to Hold Steady

Derby's Take: A Range of Fed Officials Sign On for Rates Steady

By Michael S. Derby

Federal Reserve officials may have had enduring disagreements over the push to lower rates, but in comments over recent days, they have joined in favor of holding rates steady for some time to come.

While officials are still in disagreement over the need to generate cheaper short-term borrowing costs for the economy, one thing is clear: The appetite for further lowering of rates is gone.

The idea that the central bank will hold steady after three rate cuts has taken hold since the Fed's late October policy meeting. At his press conference then, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank had likely done enough to offset risks to an otherwise healthy economy. Read More.

Fed's Clarida: U.S. Is Testing Edge of Full Employment, Price Stability

Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the U.S. economy may be testing the edge of full employment, in remarks that noted the central bank's tool kit for influencing the economy is in a good place.

Bank of Mexico Cuts Rates, as Expected

The Bank of Mexico cut interest rates by a quarter percentage-point Thursday, as expected, continuing an easing cycle that started in August when inflation eased towards the bank's target.

Bank of Canada's Poloz Says AI Could Boost Future Growth

Technological advances such as artificial intelligence could be supporting global economic expansion while simultaneously holding back wage growth and inflation, Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz said.

Australia's RBA Doesn't See Substantial Growth in Mortgage Arrears

Australia's central bank doesn't forecast an economic downturn for the country or any substantial increase in households falling behind on mortgage repayments, despite arrears hitting a decade high, a central bank official said.

Rewrite of Lower-Income Lending Rules to Advance in December

A top bank regulator is poised to propose changes to bank lending requirements that could potentially transform the way lenders make billions of dollars in loans and investments in lower-income communities.

Fed Needs to Do More, Bank of America Says

New York Fed leader John Williams on Thursday said the Fed's efforts to supply liquidity to financial markets is working. He added what has been happening in money markets isn't "a big financial stability risk, but it's something that needs to be high on our list of things we are working on." New research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch says the U.S. central bank will likely need to do more than it is now to navigate a potentially volatile year-end. The bank suspects the Fed might have to increase the size of its Treasury bill purchases and do more long-term repurchase agreement operations to calm markets. "We see a tension between a Fed that wants to add reserves via repos and dealers intermediation constraints," the bank said in its note, adding "the Fed should not care if there is a one day [year-end] repo spike but we see risks pressure could persist for a more prolonged period." (Michael S. Derby)

Basis Points

* The global economy is showing few signs of rebounding from its slowdown, as fresh figures indicate that China continues to cool and Germany and Japan are close to stagnation.

* The New York Fed added $104.293 billion to financial markets through overnight repurchase agreements and a 13-day repo operation.

* Fewer jobless Americans are relying on unemployment insurance amid tighter rules on obtaining the benefits and a strong job market.

* American consumers showed no signs of belt-tightening in sales results from Walmart, offering comfort to retailers worried about fallout from the trade war and the health of the global economy.

* Yields on U.S. government bonds have rebounded from near-historic lows hit just two months ago, sending one of the clearest signals yet that investors' recent recession fears have waned.

* The U.S. has warned Egypt of possible sanctions over its decision to proceed with a purchase of Russian warplanes, a new source of friction with a country whose leader has been lauded by President Trump.

* China announced new policies to promote advanced manufacturing, after Beijing abandoned a government-led industrial program at the center of the contentious U.S.-China trade dispute.

* The International Energy Agency raised its 2020 oil production growth estimate for countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday, with the U.S. set to drive growth.

Ex-Obama adviser leads Lazard's deals search

Orszag seeks to squeeze more from the once unruly advisory firm's outposts and win a bigger share of the fees pool

A lot is riding on Peter Orszag. A onetime wunderkind economist turned adviser to Barack Obama when president, he is now an investment banker facing a familiar but formidable Wall Street challenge: breathing new life into Lazard.

The sometimes unruly advisory firm suffered upheaval last month when its polarising star dealmaker quit as head of its European operations.

The departure of Paris-based Matthieu Pigasse has drawn attention to bigger challenges at the 171-year-old company. Its shares trail US rivals such as Evercore, and it has lost market share on the biggest mergers and acquisitions to other independent firms such as Centerview Partners.

Now, a new generation of bankers led by Mr Orszag, who took control of the group's financial advisory business in April, are being asked to squeeze more from Lazard's outposts across the world in search of a bigger share of the dealmaking fee pool.

Mr Orszag's solution comes across like the didactic briefs he used to prepare in the White House, where he was named budget director in 2008 aged only 39 and went on to push for a $900bn economic stimulus package and the Affordable Care Act.

The multi-part plan begins with pushing his US team to pursue deals involving companies valued at between $1bn and $10bn, which are often backed by private equity. The segment is not the most glamorous but Mr Orszag is attuned to the fact that it pays healthy fees.

At the same time, he is banking on Lazard's ability to retain and recruit talent attracted by its freewheeling culture.

Success would position him to succeed the 61-year-old Ken Jacobs as Lazard's chief executive.

Mr Orszag, who studied at Princeton and the London School of Economics and is the son of an Ivy League mathematics professor, said he saw similarities between his former and current occupations.

"You've got to get the numbers right," he said. "But it's a lot more than that and it involves 'should this person call this person back or should we wait?' And [it] maybe a chairman of the board or a CEO instead of a senator or member of Congress, but the interpersonal dynamic is very similar."

His career in high finance began in late 2010 when he left the White House after less than two years to join Citigroup, one of the big US banks bailed out by the federal government during the financial crisis. The leap to Lazard came in early 2016 after a meeting of minds between Mr Orszag and Mr Jacobs.

The two bumped into each other at a conference, where Mr Jacobs asked Mr Orszag how far along he was in his development as an investment banker. Mr Orszag said, "70 per cent". Mr Jacobs repeated the question months later at another gathering. When Mr Orszag replied "90 per cent", the pair decided he might fit in at Lazard.

The challenge for Lazard is that it faces rising competition from copycat firms. In 2018, it announced a fourth consecutive year of record dealmaking revenue. Yet since the start of that year, Lazard has played a role in only three of the 20 largest US M&A transactions. By contrast, Evercore worked on eight of those deals, and Centerview on seven, according to Dealogic data.

Lazard's shares have fallen 25 per cent in the past five years while shares in Evercore have risen 47 per cent.

At the same time, Lazard's asset management unit, which accounts for roughly half of the firm's revenue, has suffered from the shift to passive investing and Lazard Asset Management's focus on emerging markets. Lazard recently announced it was laying off 200 employees across investment banking and asset management.

Mr Orszag insists he is unworried.

Because of Lazard's traditional tilt towards Europe, he says, it has been hit harder than its US rivals by weakening transaction volumes on the continent in recent years. Over time, Lazard believes its competitive position will be helped by the decline of European banks on the global stage, leaving it with a smaller number of competitors. "We are the only global independent advisory firm," Mr Orszag boasts, citing deals Lazard has recently completed in Peru, Chile and China.

As has often been the case throughout its long history, there have been ructions between the international outposts. Only a month after Mr Orszag was put in charge of financial advisory, Mr Pigasse was installed as his deputy, as well as head of Europe.

The temperamental Mr Pigasse was the face of Lazard in France, the strongest European office. But rumours of his dalliances with other US boutique banks persisted even as he worked with Mr Orszag on a strategic plan.

Finally, on the evening of October 20 a Sunday the French dealmaker bid adieu to Lazard, saying in a press release that he was "excited to begin his next chapter beyond investment banking in a new entrepreneurial project" that was not identified.

Mr Orszag declined to comment on Mr Pigasse, saying: "We've got a team of five or six people globally, all of whom grew up at Lazard and know the power of the global network. They're both commercial and collegial and that's a great combo ... This team is super tight knit."

Lazard has also revamped its London leadership to keep pace with its main European rival, Rothschild. Under Mr Orszag, it is set to roll out industry sector teams in Europe, rather than rely on country coverage, as it has in the past.

As part of his focus on smaller companies, Mr Orszag has hired a nine-person group from London brokerage Numis that will focus on venture and growth banking, aiming to match late-stage start-ups with capital sources around the world.

True to his wonkish background, Mr Orszag is emphasising data analytics as a strength. He said Lazard had just won its first client mandate where it had used machine learning and natural language processing in its analysis.

Lazard is even trying to soften its image, attempting to promote a more hospitable workplace than its past reputation. Mr Orszag and Mr Jacobs are quick to tout its board-level committee on "culture", and its social media presence is filled with pictures of events showing its commitment to women and diversity.

"Evidence suggests having people from diverse backgrounds produces better outcomes when the problems you are facing are not cookie cutter," he said. "That's our entire business."

Still, fewer than 10 per cent of its managing directors in investment banking are women and its longest-standing woman managing director in New York recently resigned.

And commercial imperatives continue to triumph at the venerable firm. Despite Saudi Arabia's chequered record on human rights and growing backlash to doing business with the kingdom, Lazard recently signed up to advise the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, on its forthcoming IPO.

The decision came after its Paris office insisted that it was a crucial business to win, though Lazard says that there were a variety of views on taking the mandate.

While Mr Jacobs has calmed the waters in his decade running the firm, internal drama was once as common at Lazard as the blockbuster deals it assembled. In 2001, Michel David-Weill, then chairman and a descendant of Lazard's founding family, brought in Bruce Wasserstein to revitalise the firm after a series of star banker defections and to sort out its then-byzantine ownership structure.

The men eventually clashed and Mr David-Weill departed upon Lazard's landmark 2005 IPO. In 2009, Mr Wasserstein suddenly died. It was left to Mr Jacobs to clean up the bloated cost structure that threatened Lazard in the depths of the financial crisis.

In recent years, several brand-name rainmakers have left, including Antonio Weiss, who joined the US Treasury and then launched his own advisory firm; Gary Parr, who became a private equity investor at Apollo Global; and George Bilicic, who became president of Sempra Energy.

"Lazard is bigger than any one individual," insisted Mr Jacobs. "It survived Michel David-Weill stepping down, all the transitions and craziness of the '90s. It got through Bruce Wasserstein's tragic passing and the financial crisis in 2009. It's going to survive my stepping-down as leader someday.

"And as long as we keep strengthening the foundation of Lazard that is making it always on the cutting edge of intellectual capability, expertise we're going to do great. As soon as the quality starts to go down, then you have to worry."

'They're both commercial and collegial and that's a great combo ... This team is super tight knit'

'You've got to get the numbers right. But it's a lot more than that' Peter Orszag

Venture Sizzle Is Fizzling in China

China's venture-capital boom, which spawned some of the world's most valuable technology companies and dozens of rags-to-riches entrepreneur tales in recent years, has come to an end.

A year after an abrupt turn in investor confidence in the growth and profit potential of Chinese tech startups, venture-capital fundraising in the world's second-largest economy is on pace to touch its lowest level since 2013.

Investors that bet on the rising fortunes of innovative startups are now finding it difficult to cash out at a profit, as the pace of Chinese startups going public has slowed. Many venture funds are sitting on large unrealized gains that were the result of soaring valuations of private tech companies in recent years. The worry is that investors in the public markets won't pay such high prices for companies whose outlooks have dimmed as China's economic growth slows.

"In China, investors used to think they could make quick and high returns in private equity and venture capital. A lot of them have now gotten burnt," said Weijian Shan, chairman of Asia-focused buyout firm PAG Group. Investor losses from companies such as failed Chinese bike-sharing startups and struggling electric-vehicle makers have made many think twice about backing other fledgling businesses.

Some 61 China-focused venture-capital funds completed fundraising this year through October, raising $12.6 billion, according to Preqin, a financial-data provider. Without a surge in activity in the last two months of 2019, the tally -- which includes both U.S. dollar- and yuan-denominated fundraising -- will likely fall far short of the $25.6 billion raised last year by 170 funds.

The slowdown has been surprisingly fast. Two years ago, Asia was challenging the U.S. as the world's top destination in venture fundraising because of a surge of new money mostly from China. Venture funds, in turn, funneled cash into internet startups touting innovations in food delivery, truck-hailing, self-driving cars and health-care services. They helped mint dozens of unicorns, or private companies valued at more than $1 billion, over the past few years.

The exponential growth in venture fundraising outpaced tech innovation in the country, said Wei Zhou, managing partner of Beijing-based China Creation Ventures and a former China partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. "The number of good tech companies in China is still not bigger than in the U.S.," he said. "It's hard to imagine how the current level of innovation could sustain so much capital."

The industry was due for a correction, said Benson Tam, chairman of Venturous Group, a Beijing-based firm that invests in technology companies and real estate. Mr. Tam, a private-equity veteran who was an early investor in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., said a "wall of money" chased deals and pushed up company valuations indiscriminately.

These days, deals are taking longer to complete, and some startups have fetched less money or lower valuations than they hoped.

VIPKid, a Beijing-based online English tutoring company backed by venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital and retired basketball star Kobe Bryant, set out earlier this year to raise $500 million at a valuation of $6 billion. In September, it raised $150 million at a lower valuation than it had aimed for. The company is still trying to raise money, people familiar with its plans said.

U.S. pension funds and university endowments used to be a large source of venture-capital funds in China, but many U.S.-based investors have pulled back because of escalating trade tensions, said Victor Ai, managing director at China Everbright Ltd., a state-backed investment firm.

Asia-focused venture funds had a record $364.9 billion in assets under management as of March 2019 -- the latest data available -- of which a significant portion is invested in China, according to Preqin. The sum includes about $100 billion in "dry powder," or capital that has yet to be put to work. The total could remain elevated for a while as venture firms become more choosy about what to invest in, and profitable exits from startups become harder.

The U.S.-China trade war, as well as political turmoil in Hong Kong, have damped the near-term listing prospects of some of China's most promising startups.

In early October, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it was reconsidering its role in a Hong Kong initial public offering being planned by Megvii Technology Ltd., a Chinese developer of artificial intelligence and facial-recognition software. Megvii was recently blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department along with other tech companies that had operations in northwest China's Xinjiang region, where Beijing has detained Muslim minorities. Megvii has said its IPO plans haven't changed.

While the stocks of several high-profile Chinese tech companies that went public in the past two years, including Hong Kong-listed Meituan Dianping and Nasdaq-listed Pinduoduo Inc., have soared in value, the majority of Chinese companies that listed abroad since 2018 haven't done well.

As of end-October, shares of some 51 Chinese companies that went public in the U.S. since 2018 were down an average of 30% from their IPO prices, according to Dealogic.

They include NIO Inc., a Shanghai-based electric-car maker once hailed as China's challenger to Tesla Inc. The New York-listed company has burned through cash after raising $1 billion in an IPO in the fall of 2018, and has sold $850 million in convertible bonds since going public. It said in September it is cutting jobs and recalling vehicles because of malfunctioning batteries. NIO's stock is down about 80%, and its market value is below the total amount of money it has raised.

In Hong Kong, there are more than 30 Chinese companies in the tech and internet sector that have gone public on the city's bourse since 2018. Their share prices are down an average of 12% from their IPO prices.

Some investors and companies are hoping that China's fledgling Nasdaq-style venue for technology listings could become a viable venue for more startups to go public, giving their shareholders a way to exit at a profit. Regulators are working on new rules that could smooth the way for foreign-incorporated companies -- which include most startups that have raised money from investors abroad -- to list at home.

Moveworks Raises $75 Million in New Funding; IT-support automation company has raised a total of $105 million

Moveworks Inc., an enterprise artificial-intelligence software company, said Thursday that it raised an additional $75 million in venture capital, bringing its total raised to $105 million.

The Mountain View, Calif., firm helps large corporations respond to employees' information-technology requests. Its software automates the IT support ticketing process with a conversational AI platform that responds round-the-clock to worker queries such as asking for access to a business application, for a new piece of equipment or for some other support.

Iconiq Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Sapphire Ventures, all new investors, led the round with participation from existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures and Comerica Bank.

Moveworks, which was founded in 2016, has dozens of customers, said Bhavin Shah, its chief executive and one of its co-founders. They include Autodesk Inc., Broadcom Inc., Medallia Inc., Stitch Fix Inc. and Western Digital Corp., the company said. The CEO declined to give a specific client number.

Mr. Shah said that over the past decade or so, companies have invested a lot in IT service management to improve ticketing or workflow systems. But, on average, it can still take three days for an IT ticket to be resolved, he added.

"There hasn't been much work done to use machine learning to understand and take the action to resolve the ticket autonomously in seconds, not days," he said.

The Moveworks platform uses natural language processing and machine learning to recognize the meaning and context of common IT-support requests. For instance, the system has been trained to recognize that when an employee says "My laptop is running slow and it's been three years since I had a new one" that the employee needs a new computer.

Then, by accessing a client company's systems or those of its suppliers, the platform can automatically take care of a user's need, such as instantly authorizing network access or a new laptop.

The tool can take care of about 30% to 40% of all issues it encounters, Mr. Shah said. He added that Moveworks understands about 80% of the help tickets it receives, but is often unable to process them if, for instance, the customer hasn't integrated its suppliers' systems with Moveworks. Requests that Moveworks can't resolve are sent to the customer's IT support staff for processing.

Mr. Shah declined to provide Moveworks pricing information, other than to say the cost can run into the six- or seven-figure range annually.

San Francisco-based Medallia, a customer-experience management company that helps businesses track employee and customer engagement, has been using Moveworks for three years. Its 1,500 employees work in offices around the world.

Ashwin Ballal, Medallia's chief information officer, said Moveworks handles 35% of the 5,000 tickets coming into the Medallia's IT department each month.

Mr. Ballal said he wanted to provide a common level of support for all staffers no matter where they worked. "As a CIO, my whole point was to give a universal level of experience," he said.

While the technology takes a load off his technology staff, he says a bigger benefit is the round-the-clock support Moveworks offers.

"The experience it provides in the moment, 24/7, is what our employees are really jazzed about," he said. "Since Medallia is a customer experience company, we strongly feel that employee experiences drive better customer experiences."
