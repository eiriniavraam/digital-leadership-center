Good day. Media startups are in the spotlight after several recent venture-backed media company acquisitions. But for startups in the sector, just generating clicks and making money from advertisements doesn't work anymore. Much more from WSJ Pro's Katie Roof below.

Plus, European medical investor Sofinnova Partners has raised its latest fund as health-care investing on the continent surges.

And Canva has raised funding at a $3.2 billion valuation, courtesy of Mary Meeker's venture firm Bond.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Media deals. As media companies especially those backed by venture capital consolidate, investors say they will back startups that adapt to changing market dynamics, achieve greater scale and diversify revenue streams without being too dependent on click-based ads, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports.

* Several content acquisitions involving venture-backed companies have been announced in recent weeks, including Group Nine Media Inc.'s acquisition of PopSugar Inc. for north of $300 million, Refinery29 Inc.'s purchase by Vice Media LLC for about $400 million, and Vox Media Inc.'s acquisition of New York magazine parent New York Media for about $105 million.

* Still, some other disappointments in the sector have made investors skittish. Funding for general media and content startups fell to about $300 million last year, following four consecutive years of roughly $800 million or more, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

* "What we've all learned has been that you need to have really massive scale to rely on advertising as your sole business model," said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. Companies also need to have additional revenue streams beyond click-based ads, such as events or e-commerce.

European health fund. Paris-based medical investor Sofinnova Partners has closed its latest early-stage fund at  ¬333 million ($368.4 million), continuing a streak of new funds being raised by Europe's top health-care venture-capital firms, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports.

* Investment in European health-care companies has risen as large venture investors have been deploying new funds, and this year is in line to be one of the strongest ever for European venture funding in the medical field.

* Health-care startups there rounded up $4.98 billion in the first three quarters of this year, nearly as much as the $5.16 billion raised in all of 2018, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. The record is $7.17 billion in 2009.

* American investors also are coming to Europe searching for better valuations than the ones they see in the U.S., where health-care venture investment is exploding, Sofinnova Chairman and Managing Partner Antoine Papiernik said. As a result, European startups now have more funding options, he said.

PowerPoint competitor. Design software startup Canva Pty. Ltd. has raised new funding at a valuation of $3.2 billion, a 28% increase over its value a few months ago, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports. Mary Meeker's Bond led the $85 million investment in Sydney-based Canva, which pitches its presentations product as a competitor to Microsoft Corp.'s PowerPoint. Bond participated in Canva's prior round in May, when the company raised $70 million.

Investigation. Britain's antitrust watchdog has launched a formal probe into Amazon.com Inc.'s investment into Deliveroo, a British food-delivery startup, marking the official start of a relatively novel review that regulators signaled earlier this month, the Journal reports.

Cyber deal. Cybersecurity startup Corelight Inc. has raised $50 million to help expand its client base and invest more heavily in research and development, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. The San Francisco-based company offers open-source threat-detection technology to secure computer networks and enable customers to write and install custom applications. Corelight's technology can detect subtle malicious behavior on computer networks and offer insights on threats, according to Teddie Wardi of Insight Partners, which led the company's latest funding round.

Cloud deal. Pensando Systems, a networking startup launched by Cisco Systems Inc.'s famed "MPLS" team, has raised a $145 million Series C round led by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Lightspeed Venture Partners, and has named long-time Cisco chief John Chambers chairman. The San Jose, Calif., company, which has been operating in stealth mode, also unveiled its flagship software-defined edge services platform that it said will compete with the Nitro system from Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services cloud unit.

AI for call centers. Invoca Inc., a provider of call-analytics software powered by artificial intelligence, has raised $41 million in new equity financing and secured a $15 million line of credit, Jared Council reports for WSJ Pro Artificial Intelligence. The software company's eponymous platform uses AI to analyze call-center conversations and determine the outcome of the call, such as a scheduled appointment or sale.

Exits

Thrive Global, a behavior change media and technology company founded by Arianna Huffington, acquired neuroscience-based artificial intelligence startup Boundless Mind for an undisclosed amount. In connection with the acquisition, Thrive grabbed a new round of funding led by JAZZ Venture Partners, a firm that previously backed Boundless, bringing the total raised by the company to over $65 million. New York-based Thrive is backed by Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Greycroft Partners, Blue Pool Capital, Advancit Capital, Canvas Ventures, Female Founders Fund and others. Revolution's Rise of the Rest Seed Fund also previously invested in Boundless Mind.

View the Space Inc., a leasing and asset management platform for the commercial real-estate industry, agreed to acquire PropertyCapsule, a provider of marketing automation and prospecting software to retail landlords, for an undisclosed sum. New York-based VTS is backed by investors including Blackstone Group Inc., Insight Venture Partners, OpenView Venture Partners and Trinity Ventures. PropertyCapsule was also backed by Trinity.

AI Call- Analytics  Company Raises $41 Million in Equity Financing; Invoca's software uses AI to analyze call-center conversations, helping clients tailor marketing campaigns

Invoca Inc., a provider of call-analytics software powered by artificial intelligence, said Thursday that it raised $41 million in new equity financing and secured a $15 million line of credit.

The investment round was led by Upfront Ventures and H.I.G. Growth Partners, with participation from Accel, Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, Industry Ventures and Bonfire Ventures. The credit facility is from ORIX Corp. USA.

Invoca, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., has raised $101 million in equity capital since its founding in 2008. Its customers include Dish Network Corp., U.S. Bancorp and SunTrust Banks Inc.

The software company's eponymous platform uses AI to analyze call-center conversations and determine the outcome of the call, such as a scheduled appointment or sale. Invoca then feeds its analysis to a client's marketing managers, who can use the information to tailor future marketing campaigns or content.

At the heart of Invoca is a tool dubbed Signal AI, which uses natural language processing to pick up key topics, such as a pricing question or cancellation request, discussed during a call.

When a consumer calls a client company that uses Invoca's platform, that person dials a unique phone number generated for him or her. That means the software can understand the online activity that preceded the customer's call, including any product pages viewed and any ads clicked.

Costs for Invoca's system start at around $25,000 annually and can go up to seven figures, the company said, depending on the volume of calls and the functionality sought.

Corporate marketers have an array of tools for determining how their investments in digital ads perform online, including metrics such as click-through and conversion rates. But Invoca Chief Executive Gregg Johnson said marketers often have little insight into how those ads affect phone calls, which are often important for purchases such as a home mortgage or satellite service.

"Marketers are spending lots of money on digital advertising to reach a very wide audience of people, but at some point in that buying process those consumers want to consult with an expert," Mr. Johnson said. "And it's very hard to piece together the data from those two different customer experiences."

Invoca competes against CallMiner Inc., Clarabridge Inc., DialogTech Inc. and others in a category Forrester Research Inc. calls "AI-fueled speech analytics."

AI speech-analytics software has long been used by customer-service managers for coaching agents or making sure they follow rules, but in the past few years its usage has spread to sales and marketing departments, said Daniel Hong, a vice president and research director at Forrester. Mr. Hong said that he hasn't seen Invoca's software at work, but that being able to link online and offline consumer activity can yield rich insights for companies.

University Hospitals, a Cleveland-based health-care system with more than 200 locations including hospitals and medical centers, started using Invoca last year to help analyze the roughly 400,000 phone calls it gets monthly. Noah Brooks, its digital engagement manager, said the software allowed his team to understand which keyword search ads such as "urgent care near me" or "proton treatment options," referring to a type of radiation treatment were most likely to lead to booked appointments.

Mr. Brooks said that since University Hospitals deployed the system, its return on advertising spending nearly doubled. In January, it was generating about $11 in revenue for every ad dollar spent, a figure that grew to roughly $20 in August, the latest month of available data.

Why hedge fund managers are happy to let the machines take over

Some claim computers are getting better at finding profitable patterns in market data

A month ago many computer-driven investors watched astonished as markets were wracked by a financial tempest, with once-hot stocks tumbling and previously shunned sectors enjoying a revival.

But for Michael Kharitonov, the chief executive ofSan Francisco-based Voleon Group, the rapid rotation out of momentum stocks that wrongfooted many investors was  boring .

The $6bn-in-assets hedge fund hardly noticed the brief but dramatic reversal.  We saw nothing,  he says, with a chuckle.

Voleon sees itself as at the vanguard of the next wave ofquantitative investing, using machine learning to unearth patterns too faint for others to detect. Machine learning is a hot field of artificial intelligence, where algorithms work in a dynamic fashion, continuously adapting to new data.

The methods of the machines can be hard to explain, even for the fund managers presented with a raft of positions. Investors in those funds cannot go to their internal investment committees and talk about how the results were obtained. According to Mr Kharitonov, the majority of the patterns  have no simple economic rationale .

Still, he predicts machine learning will be the next wave of innovation across the asset-management industry.  The tools are complex, but eventually others will have to move in this direction if they want to remain differentiated,  he said.

The Bank of England concurs. In a report on Wednesday on machine learning in UK financial services, it found that two-thirds of respondents already use it and that many expected to more than double the number of business areas in which they drew on it within the next three years.

Traditional trading algorithms are given a set of rules by human coders   for example, buy if a stock has climbed above its long-term moving average. But an algorithm derived from machine learning can extrapolate rules from the data itself. As a result, it learns as markets fluctuate.

This differs from mainstream quantitative investing, which primarily revolves around   factors . These range from established long-term trends such as the tendency for cheap or trendy stocks to do well, to niche bets, such as exploiting the difference between the stock market s actual volatility and the volatility implied by options prices.

These typically start as a hypothesis, which a quant then tests against the historical data. If it appears true they then start a new test on live data, and see if the factor, or signal, remains. Voleon, however, says it needs no economic theory to underpin its trades.

 Quants automate decisions that used to be made by humans. We automate the decisions that are made by quants,  Mr Kharitonov said.

This approach has advantages. September s dramatic reversal in fortunes for the big quant factors knocked many investors such as Transtrend of Rotterdam and Man Group s AHL unit. But Voleon s main fund gained 1.2 per cent over the month, taking its gains this year to 9.2 per cent, according to people familiar with the matter.

Voleon s approach reflects the background of its senior management. Mr Kharitonov has a PhD in computer science from Stanford, and its chief investment officer Jon McAuliffe has a PhD in statistics from the University of California. Both worked at DE Shaw, a pioneer of quantitative investing, before founding Voleon in 2007.

Initially investors were sceptical of the murky nature of its approach, and the hedge fund s performance was uneven. But since 2012 better results have whetted investor appetite.

In 2016 Voleon started a fund that trades less and has an average holding period of two months, compared with its main fund s two-week average. Including leverage, the two funds now juggle positions of about $36bn.

Sceptics of machine learning argue that it often amounts to mere data mining, a cardinal sin of statistics where algorithms find spurious correlations that look strong but are in reality an illusion. They argue that an economic rationale for an investment factor is not a luxury   instead, it makes them feel more confident in its durability.

But machine learning is undeniably a focus for the industry. Even AQR Capital Management, among the best known of factor investors, has set up a unit to explore its uses. While the gains will probably be  evolutionary, not revolutionary , the hedge fund conceded that it has the potential  to be the next leap forward  in quantitative investing.

 Two key points are crucial for understanding the current state of machine learning in the practice of asset management,  AQR wrote in a June report.  The first is that research is just taking off and many important questions are yet to be answered. The second is that early research evidence indicates potential economically and statistically significant improvements in the performance of portfolios that leverage machine learning tools. 

There are a multitude of machine-learning efforts across the asset management world these days, but, reflecting onVoleon s own struggles, Mr Kharitonov doubts that all will be successful. He argues that to truly unlock the potential, companies will need to weave machine learning into their entire process.

 There is a misconception that there s this magical thing called AI that you can do anything with. But it's not true,  he says.  Our first-generation system used machine learning to make predictions, but the rest was conventional. That was like putting a Ferrari engine into a Lexus.

Good day. The city of San Francisco home to Uber, Airbnb and other tech companies that tested their products in the city plans to open a new office that will require city approval for businesses that impact the public.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed explained the rationale for the new Office of Emerging Technology on stage at the WSJ's "Women in the Workplace" forum Tuesday in San Francisco.

"All of the sudden, one day we saw all these scooters all over the city," Ms. Breed said. "But it was like, wait a minute, did we approve that?"

While Ms. Breed said she liked scooters, she wants the city to have a management system for them. The new office is a government effort to be more proactive in dealing with new technologies, she said.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Crypto freeze. Regulatory action stopping Telegram Group from distributing its cryptocurrency will hold up investors' capital and cast a chill on future use of digital assets to raise capital, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports.

* Dubai-based Telegram conducted one of the world's largest crypto offerings in 2018, raising $1.7 billion by selling rights to its future tokens. Top venture firms bought into the deal including Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to the firm's website. Benchmark Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital also were among investors, according to people familiar with the situation.

* Dozens of crypto companies raised more than a billion dollars in the U.S. via presales of their tokens in recent years. But the Securities and Exchange Commission's action against Telegram is raising questions over the viability of other similar presales.

* "It certainly complicates the ability to get liquidity on behalf of venture investors," said Mark Radcliffe, a partner at the law firm DLA Piper, of the regulator's action. Mr. Radcliffe wasn't involved with the Telegram offering.

Mining in Texas. Bitcoin mining is often thought to be controlled by companies in China, but a U.S. startup has raised $50 million to challenge that notion, WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron reports. San Francisco-based bitcoin-mining company Layer1 Technologies Inc. was valued at $200 million in a Series A funding round from investors including Peter Thiel, Shasta Ventures and Digital Currency Group. Close to 79% of the world's bitcoin mining takes place in China, the Journal reported last year. For bitcoin to become mainstream in the U.S., a U.S. mining company must gain the trust of regulators and legislators, according to Alexander Liegl, the company's co-founder and chief executive. Layer1 hopes to play that role.

Bike sharing. Shared-bike startup Wheels Labs Inc. has raised $50 million to expand its fleet of electric-powered bikes into new markets abroad, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. The funding marks investors' latest bet on so-called micro-mobility, where startups offering shared fleets of scooters, traditional bicycles and electric-powered bikes are competing to create viable local transportation businesses.West Hollywood, Calif.-based Wheels was founded in 2018 by brothers Joshua and Jonathan Viner. The pair previously founded dog-walking startup Wag Labs Inc.

Exits

Benefits-management company Progyny Inc. said it expects to sell 6.7 million shares at $14 to $16 apiece in its initial public offering. At the $15 midpoint of that range, the New York company focused on fertility and family-building benefits will have a market capitalization of roughly $1.23 billion. TPG Biotech, Kleiner Perkins, S.R. One and Merck Ventures are among Progyny's major shareholders.

UiPath Inc., a provider of automation software for businesses, acquired Estonian process documentation software provider StepShot along with Dutch process mining vendor ProcessGold. Terms weren't disclosed. In April, UiPath closed a $568 million Series D round, giving the company a post-money valuation of $7 billion. Coatue, Accel, IVP and Sequoia Capital were among the investors.

Property management specialist Mynd purchased Empire Industries LLC, which manages properties in Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, for an undisclosed amount. Oakland, Calif.-based Mynd now manages more than 9,000 units in 16 markets and is backed by investors including Lightspeed Ventures, Canaan Partners and Jackson Square Ventures.

VC Funds

Early-stage investor Craft Ventures completed raising a $500 million second fund to continue investing in the equity of blockchain companies. The firm, with offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, closed its first fund at $350 million in January 2018.

M13 closed its latest fund at $175 million, above its original $150 million target. Fund II will focus on seed and Series A investments in consumer-technology companies. The firm was founded in 2016 and has offices in Santa Monica, Calif., New York and San Francisco.

Goldman Sachs was the exception as a day of solid third-quarter updates helped support US markets. Goldman faded as weak investment bank fees and an unexpectedly small stock buyback meant its earnings per share missed forecasts.

UnitedHealth led the health insurers sharply higher after beating expectations for the past quarter and giving reassuring guidance. Anthem, Cigna and Humana were among the peers to gain in concert.

Better than expected results also lifted Charles Schwab. The brokerage said that client funds had reached a record $3.77tn, having brought in $56.6bn of new assets in the quarter.

Nvidia rose after Merrill Lynch raised its price target on the chipmaker and repeated "buy" advice. Advances in natural language processing would be the next big catalyst for data centre demand, and the breadth of Nvidia's hardware and software ecosystem provided an advantage that no competitor could match, Merrill said.

Manchester United jumped after coowner Kevin Glazer converted his 13 per cent stake in the football club from family-controlled class B shares and into the more liquid class A designation, which raised the possibility of a sale.

Crisis heightens liquidity fears and further erodes investor faith in sector

The bombshell sacking of Neil Woodford months after his flagship Equity Income Fund was suspended will have consequences far beyond the implosion of Britain's best-known stockpicker.

The crisis has heightened concerns about liquidity and further tarnished investor confidence in active fund managers at a time when they are battling the incessant rise of cheaper passive investment funds and struggling to produce returns in a low-interest-rate environment.

"Investors all over are jumpy and nervous," said Peter Brunt, an executive at Morningstar, the fund data company. "Active managers have taken a blow and liquidity is certainly part of that."

The June suspension of the Equity Income Fund to protect it from a wave of withdrawals prompted regulators across Europe to launch probes into fund liquidity. Asset managers spent the summer fielding questions from investors over whether they would struggle to sell assets fast enough to meet redemption requests in the event of a run on their funds.

Mr Woodford's downfall was brought about by such a "liquidity mismatch" as he struggled to shift his stakes in smallcap and unquoted companies when investors fled in droves this year, as well as chronic underperformance.

Catherine McKinnell MP, interim chair of the UK's Treasury select committee, said: "This appears to be the beginning of the end of a sorry state of affairs ... There is still some time to go in this uncomfortable episode, which has raised important questions about the functioning of the funds industry."

Having managed more than 15bn just over two years ago, the fund manager oversaw less than 850m yesterday morning. By the end of the day he had no remaining funds after he dramatically quit his investment trust and income focus fund. The 78m of revenue produced by Woodford Investment Management in the 2018 financial year will now be reduced to nothing.

The flagship Equity Income Fund was set up to be, in the industry parlance, a "widows and orphan" product designed to provide cautious investors with high dividend payments and low risk returns.

"The whole purpose of that strategy was for investors to sleep easy at night and lose less money than the market," said one person close to the fund manager. In reality, the portfolio was piled high with speculative bets on unlisted companies, which proved hard to sell when investors bolted.

One equity income investor, speaking anonymously to the Financial Times, reacted furiously to the decision to close the fund.

"It is poor treatment of investors in the fund not to put the wind-up to a vote, with an option to appoint a new manager," he said. "It makes a mockery of the principle of treating customers fairly."

Among Mr Woodford's more audacious investments was Industrial Heat, a North Carolina business that attempted to develop power sources based on dubious science. The company attracted investment from Brad Pitt and Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs' widow, among others. But Mr Woodford ploughed in significantly more than the other highprofile backers, investing 54m for a quarter of the business.

Other investments proved spectacular failures, including Prothena, a US biomedical company that Mr Woodford owned a third of and which was once valued at $1.5bn. In April 2018 the business reported the failure of a major clinical trial and within an hour of the market opening, its share price had nosedived 70 per cent.

Paul Myners, the former City minister, told the FT that while the winding down of the fund would speed up the return of money to investors, it was not the end of the matter.

"Parliament and regulators need to look at the absence of effective customer voice in the governance of individual funds, the complicity and opaqueness of the role of investment platforms ... and how to manage and value unquoted and illiquid assets in open-ended funds," he said. "If nothing is done, we will have repeats of the Woodford incident."

During testimony to the Treasury select committee yesterday, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, told MPs there was a need to address structural issues with open-ended funds that allow investors to withdraw their money daily.

Asked whether the Woodford episode highlighted the risks of such funds and whether there was a need for change, he said: "Yes and yes ... There is a structural problem in open-ended funds." Mr Carney has previously stated that such funds are "built on a lie".

While it was not the BoE's direct responsibility to deal with issues of consumer protection, he said the central bank was looking at ways to address the risks such funds might raise for the functioning of the financial system and its ability to support economic growth.

Donald Kohn, a member of the BoE's financial policy committee, added that the FPC had been working with the Financial Conduct Authority to find ways "to better align the redemption terms of the fund with the liquidity of the assets they're holding".

The FCA last month published longawaited rules aimed at protecting investors in open-ended funds invested in hard-to-sell assets. The report was in response to several UK property funds that were forced to shut in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in 2016, but it also considered the fallout from the Woodford suspension and a similar case last year at Swiss manager GAM.

Under the rules, which take effect in September 2020, property funds that fall into the newly created category of "funds investing in inherently illiquid assets" will be subject to greater disclosure requirements, enhanced depositary oversight and will need to produce liquidity risk contingency plans.

The FCA will also introduce a requirement forcing property funds to halt trading if there is uncertainty about the value of 20 per cent or more of their portfolios.

Regulators in other European asset management hubs have also consulted with fund managers over potentially bolstering their fund rules in response to liquidity risk. In Luxembourg, home to 37 per cent of European retail fund assets, with about  ¬3.4tn of funds domiciled in the country, the watchdog started holding private talks with fund managers in July. The Irish regulator had already been concerned about the prospect of funds sold to UK investors suffering heavy outflows in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Bringing the curtain down on the Woodford fund does nothing to allay those concerns.

The Property Report
Short Seller Shuts Down as Malls He Bet Against Survive

The business of running malls has been reeling, but Wall Street is learning it isn't always easy to make money from their troubles.

Alder Hill Management LP, which aimed to profit by betting against debt tied to some of the country's weakest malls, ended this trade over the summer, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Eric Yip, a founder of the New York-based hedge fund, is also winding down the entire $300 million hedge fund, this person said.

While some of Alder Hill's other trading strategies had been profitable, its 2 1/2 years of losses shorting mall debt convinced Mr. Yip to shut down, according to the person familiar with the matter.

Alder Hill and other short sellers -- or traders who bet that the price of a bond, stock or other asset will fall -- have found that their wagers against commercial mortgage-backed securities tied to retail property didn't go as planned.

That is largely because the rise in retailer bankruptcies and store closures since 2017 didn't produce a significant increase in missed loan payments by mall owners, according to data from commercial mortgage tracker Trepp LLC.

Since a significant number of these loans require interest-only payments, or have a partial interest-only payment schedule until they mature, property owners have been current on their loans despite weaker rents, said Dylan Wall, a research analyst at Trepp.

The short sellers took a short position on the CMBX, a little-known credit default swap index that tracks the values of bonds backed by mortgages of malls and other commercial real estate, such as offices and hotels. The short sellers make money when bond values fall as loan defaults occur.

Prices of one slice of the CMBX Series 6 securities -- which had a large exposure to loans made to underperforming malls -- fell in 2017. But then they rebounded in 2018. This year, they have continued to rise and are now close to levels when Alder Hill published its first report in early 2017 laying out his mall short, according to data from IHS Markit.

That has made it difficult for short sellers to profit, especially since the bet requires them to make a regular 3% coupon cost as part of the short-sale process.

Only three of the roughly 40 malls tied to the CMBX 6 -- Fashion Outlets of Las Vegas in Primm, Nev., Salem Center in Salem, Ore., and Westgate Mall in Brainerd, Minn. -- had delinquent loans. Occupancy in these centers now hovers between 58% to 79%, according to Trepp.

Vacancy rate in malls rose to 9.4% in the third quarter, the highest it has been since 2011, and up from 9.1% from the same period a year ago, according to Reis Moody's Analytics Inc.

Weaker malls generally take a long time to close, in part because they have locked in many retail tenants with leases that have staggered maturity dates, which means malls usually have some tenants still under contract.

Mall landlords have also become more flexible in negotiations with tenants over lease terms. They have filled vacated space with more nontraditional tenants, such as medical offices, churches and offices, helping to keep many of them still occupied.

Short sellers focused on the shares of listed mall owners have done much better than those focused on the debt. Total returns from mall landlords fell 2.7% and 7% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In the first nine months, they are down 4.6%, according to Nareit data.

Alder Hill isn't an outlier among hedge funds, which have suffered poorer-than-expected returns. Overall, hedge funds have generally underperformed, recording less than half the returns of the stock market in the first half of 2019.

Deals

Mexico's Alta Growth Capital Backs Education Company

Latin American private-equity firm Alta Growth Capital said it invested in Lottus Education SAPI de CV, a Mexican higher-education provider, marking the firm's first deal in the education sector, Luis Garcia reports. Founded in 2015, Mexico-based Lottus offers high-school, undergraduate and graduate educational programs through two units: Universidad Latinoamericana and Universidad Tres Culturas.

Ardian has arranged a credit facility to back a refinancing and capital reorganization of Latour Capital-owned Syclef Holding SAS, a major provider of industrial and commercial refrigeration and cooling systems. The financing is also available for fresh acquisitions by the company. Syclef embarked on a series of deals after Paris-based Latour Capital acquired it in late 2015 from a fund that was then managed by Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partners. The company bought 10 businesses in roughly three years, growing to 31 locations across France and reaching a total of 540 employees.

Foreside Financial Group LLC, a regulatory and compliance services company backed by Lovell Minnick Partners since 2017, said it has acquired Compliance Advisory Services, a regulatory consultant for financial institutions. The acquisition is the second add-on deal that Foreside has backed in the past year. Earlier this year, Foreside said it acquired another regulatory compliance provider NCS Regulatory Compliance. Lovell Minnick is a private-equity firm focused on investments in financial-services companies that closed its fifth fund with $1.28 billion.

Private-equity firms American Securities and Lindsay Goldberg have agreed to buy the management-services business of Aecom for $2.41 billion. The Germantown, Md.-based unit comprises the seventh-largest government-services business, with a $20 billion backlog running military test sites and even the Air Force's secretive Janet Airlines, which ferries personnel to and from its Area 51 site. Los Angeles-based Aecom said it expects to close the transaction, which includes cash, debt and working capital adjustments, in the first half of fiscal 2020.

Nordic Capital has agreed to acquire ILOQ, a Finnish technology company, for about  ¬190 million ($209.5 million). The investment aims to propel the maker of digital and mechatronic locks into new international markets. The deal with the company's main shareholders was made through the firm's Nordic Capital Fund IX and is subject to regulatory approval. It is expected to close this year.

KKR & Co.-backed Swiss software management company SoftwareOne Holdings AG began its initial public share offering Monday on the SIX Swiss Exchange, priced from 16.50 Swiss francs to 21 francs a share ($16.50 to $21). The company, which provides license management systems to more than 12,000 corporate customers in 115 countries, expects to raise as much as 809.5 million francs in the offering, to give it a market capitalization of up to 3.2 billion. SoftwareOne said KKR would retain a significant stake in the company following the IPO, while the combined holdings of the three founding investors would represent the largest stake. Final pricing of the shares is expected around Oct. 25.

Private-equity firm Hanover Investors has agreed to acquire Brady PLC for 8.3 million ($10.5 million). Shareholders would receive 10 pence a share under the agreement, a 45% premium to the Monday closing price of 6.90 pence. The provider of trading, risk management and settlement systems to the energy and commodities sectors last month said it would need up to 15 million to implement a multi-year strategic plan. But the proposed buyout is conditioned on no member of the Brady group becoming insolvent or the equivalent.

Cerberus Capital Management has agreed to buy the North American, Costa Rican and Japanese businesses and facilities of Closure Systems International from New Zealand packaging conglomerate Reynolds Group Holdings Ltd., a unit of Rank Group. Cerberus said the acquired business, which provides caps and lids for a variety of bottles and containers, is the largest producer of closures in North America. Reynolds will retain closures businesses in Europe, the Middle East, Egypt and South America. Rank, the manufacturing conglomerate controlled by billionaire Graeme Hart, acquired Closure Systems in 2008 as part of its $2.7 billion purchase of Alcoa's consumer and packaging divisions. The deal is expected to close by late this year or early next year.

A participation-investment fund, or FIP, managed by Brazilian investment bank Modal, has agreed to acquire slightly more than 17.1% of Renova Energia SA for a token sum of 1 real ($0.24) from Light SA, an energy company in Rio de Janeiro. In addition, Light said another subsidiary, Lightcom Comercializadora de Energia SA, "assigned all of the credits held against Renova to CG." FIPs are the vehicles used as private-equity funds in Brazil. Closing the deal is subject to certain conditions.

KKR & Co. has acquired a majority stake in Hyperoptic Ltd., the U.K.'s largest residential high-speed broadband provider, from funds managed by Newlight Partners and Mubadala Investment Co. Hyperoptic's fiber-optic network serves 43 towns and cities across the U.K., with lines passing almost 400,000 homes and businesses. KKR invested in the operation through its Global Infrastructure Investors Fund III.

Lovell Minnick Partners has acquired Billhighway, a Troy, Mich.-based provider of integrated software and payments systems for membership-based organizations such as fraternities, unions and clubs. Its systems are used for accounting, reconciliation and reporting as well as bill payment and management.

What next for Woodford Equity Income investors?

Decision to liquidate stricken fund means investors will receive some money back, but face heavy losses

Tuesday s announcement that the flagship Woodford Equity Income fund will be wound up is said to be in the  best interests of all investors  as it will enable the return of cash invested  at the earliest opportunity .

However, the hundreds of thousands of retail investors who placed their faith with former star stockpicker Neil Woodford face a long wait to get their money back from the 2.9bn fund, which has been suspended since June, and potentially face large losses.

What has happened to the fund?

The fund was suspended in June after a surge in investors pulling out their money left Mr Woodford unable to meet all the redemptions requests, due to his portfolio s large exposure to unquoted and small-cap, illiquid stocks that cannot easily be bought or sold. The decision to  gate  the fund   in other words to prevent investors from accessing their cash   was taken to give Mr Woodford time to reposition the fund s portfolio into more easily sold investments while avoiding a  fire sale  of assets.

The fund had been expected to reopen in December. However, Link Fund Solutions, the fund s authorised corporate director, said that during the four months of the suspension it had been unable to reposition the portfolio into sufficiently liquid assets and that reopening it would risk a fresh suspension. It now intends to close the fund by selling down the portfolio and returning cash to investors. Mr Woodford has been fired as the fund s manager with immediate effect.

Link has appointed BlackRock, the world s largest asset manager, to sell off the fund s liquid holdings, while PJT Partners, the investment bank, will sell the private and illiquid assets.

How much money can investors hope to get back?

Given the fund s prolonged poor performance, it is inevitable that investors will end up with less than they initially invested. Over the past three years, the fund has lost 35.9 per cent of its value, compared with a 17.5 per cent gain for the FTSE All Share, its comparative benchmark, according to FE Analytics.

But the extent of their losses will depend on how much Link can raise from selling the fund s assets. Link said it intends to sell the portfolio s less liquid assets  in an orderly manner  in order to limit investor losses   a key risk when securities are sold on a forced or  fire sale  basis.

However, the outlook does not appear favourable for many of the fund s listed investments. Last month, Woodford dumped his stake in IP Group at a material discount to the intellectual property incubator s share price. Several of the Equity Income fund s biggest holdings, including Burford Capital, Provident Financial, Kier Group, Amigo Holdings and Allied Minds, have fallen steeply since the fund was suspended, making it unlikely that Link can sell them for a good price.

How soon can investors expect to see any cash?

Investors will receive their money back in instalments as Link sells the assets in the portfolio. This process will begin in mid-January and Link expects to pay out the first tranche by the end of that month.

However, investors could face a long wait before receiving all that is owed to them, given the portfolio s exposure to hard-to-sell assets. According to the Financial Conduct Authority, a snapshot of the fund s assets in April showed a third of its assets would take six months to a year or more to liquidate.  The portfolio has shifted a bit since then, but it is unlikely to be a quick process,  says Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell.

Investors will be granted a refund from the intermediary through which they invested in the fund, for example their investment platform or financial adviser.

Will investors still be charged fees?

Investors will not be charged direct fees while the fund is being wound up. However, they will still incur costs linked to the liquidation of the portfolio. The cost of selling off assets, including the fees paid to BlackRock and PJT, will be taken out of any proceeds from the sale, eating into the money that investors get back.

How will the refund be treated for tax purposes?

The refund that investors receive will be treated as a sale for tax purposes, meaning a capital gains tax charge may be triggered   although the likelihood of this will be tempered by the fund s poor performance in recent years.

But investors who held the fund through tax wrappers such as an Isa or Sipp should receive the money into their accounts, where it will be available for them to reinvest. Investment platforms AJ Bell and Interactive Investor have both confirmed to FT Money that this is their understanding of what will happen.

What does Neil Woodford have to say?

Mr Woodford has hit back at the decision to close the fund.  This was Link s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests [of investors],  he said in a statement on Tuesday.

What does this mean for other Woodford managed funds?

Mr Woodford s position as manager of the Woodford Patient Capital, the listed investment trust that bears his name, appears more vulnerable than ever. The trust s board said on Tuesday that it was reviewing its investment management arrangements. It has been hunting for a new manager to replace Mr Woodford, which could be agreed in the fourth quarter.

Shares in the trust, which have fallen nearly 60 per cent over the past year, tumbled more than 8 per cent to hit a fresh all-time low soon after markets opened on Tuesday and now trade at a 44 per cent discount to net asset value (NAV).

His other remaining fund, the Woodford Income Focus fund, now manages less than 300m of assets, a reduction of 20 per cent over the past year. If investors continue to flee, the fund may dwindle to a size that makes it no longer viable.

What action could regulators take?

The Financial Conduct Authority, which said it welcomed the  removal of uncertainty  provided by the decision to wind up the Woodford fund, has already opened an investigation into the case, which could lead to bans and fines if wrongdoing is found. Link is also under investigation.

The FCA is also examining whether changes are needed to the regulatory framework for open-ended funds. Although the FCA does not have the power to change the Ucits fund rules   the EU directive that governs retail funds   the regulator said last month that it planned to explore remedies that could help to avert another Woodford crisis, including reviewing the practice of daily dealing.

The FCA itself is facing criticism over whether it was too slow to react. The influential Treasury select committee of MPs said over the summer that it would scrutinise the regulator s supervision of the Woodford fund.

What does Hargreaves Lansdown have to say?

The FTSE 100 fund supermarket has been in the crosshairs for recommending the Woodford Equity Income fund in its Wealth 50 list of recommended funds until the day of its suspension. Hargreaves kept the fund on the list when it was reviewed in January 2019, at the same time that it secured a further discount from Woodford on fund fees, raising questions about the commercial links between the two companies.

Hargreaves has defended its  best buy  rating system, but when questioned by MPs it acknowledged that there are  learnings and improvements  from the Woodford episode. The fund platform said it was working closely with its customers   291,520 of whom are exposed to the Woodford fund directly and indirectly   to keep them informed as the fund is wound up.

Banks

HSBC-owned company plans brand revamp to woo younger customers

HSBC is planning an overhaul of its First Direct brand to attract younger customers and compete with fast-growing new digital rivals such as Monzo.

Joe Gordon, First Direct's chief executive, said the bank would make a string of changes over the next 12 months to improve its services, introduce new features and become "more accessible to a wider population".

Some of the new products it is working Joe Gordon, chief executive on include an in-app marketplace and a "financial autopilot" that would use artificial intelligence to make personalised recommendations and automate activities such as topping up savings accounts. Successful features could eventually be introduced to customers of HSBC's main brand.

"We have a proud heritage of being the original challenger bank back in 1989 now we're making a real digital pivot to tackle the environment as it is now," said Mr Gordon.

The plans highlight the impact appbased challengers have had on Britain's established lenders. Companies such as Monzo and Revolut have signed up millions of customers in the past few years, prompting big banks to modernise their services and, in some cases, build entirely new brands to compete.

First Direct will also allow customers with limited credit histories to open accounts and will provide services to help them improve their records.

"First Direct was never set up for a specific demographic; it was for people who wanted to do things differently," said Mr Gordon. "Maybe the approach to credit scoring over time meant some people felt they couldn't be part of that."

He said the bank was working with a number of fintech companies, including London-based Bud, which HSBC invested in alongside Goldman Sachs and several other banks this year.

First Direct has about 1.45m customers and its focus on telephone-based customer service has helped it to consistently appear near the top of official customer satisfaction surveys.

It does not report separate financial results, but says it has been consistently profitable since 1995, and the bank is hoping its established record will give it an advantage over newer competitors.

None of the so-called neobanks has yet been able to turn its popularity into profit and some have struggled to convince customers to trust them as their primary bank.

In addition to the consumer-focused First Direct, HSBC is separately working on a new digital business banking service known internally as Project Iceberg.

The approach compares with rival Royal Bank of Scotland, which is building a pair of standalone digital banks   Bo for consumers and Mettle for business customers.

Asset management will be transformed by Darwinian struggle

T he current pressures on the asset management industry remind me of the old line about reaching a historic crossroads where one path leads to despair and the other to total extinction.

Faced with slower inflows and fee compression, as well as rising costs, asset managers are locked in a Darwinian struggle that will reshape the competitive landscape of the industry in 10 years.

Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, has said we tend to overestimate the change that will happen in the next two years, yet underestimate the change that will happen over a decade.

Where will the industry be in 10 years' time? Here are my five predictions for 2029. I do not aspire to get all five correct my goal is to develop our thinking about the implications for the industry's current priorities.

First, deflation will be investors' biggest challenge. Factors such as technology, ageing populations and globalisation will continue to drive the world's economy.

Inflation, wage growth and productivity growth are still slow today, despite a decade of extraordinary monetary stimulus. Global growth continues to struggle to reach "escape velocity" as it has since the global financial crisis.

Meanwhile, the labour force participation rate continues to decline. Up to a quarter of men in prime working years in the US are expected not to be working by 2050 as automation bites harder.

Such a protracted slower environment will make saving for retirement harder. Already a quarter of global debt markets trade at negative rates what if that rose to 50 per cent by 2029? Investors will probably take on more risk and complexity with the risk of leverage-induced bubbles far higher.

Second, China will dominate. The rise of Asia will shift the balance of industry power and, by 2029, the largest asset manager in the world will be Chinese.

Assets under management in the country are estimated to grow at more than 17 per cent annually over the next five years. Chinese mutual funds hold 8 per cent of personal financial assets today. There is another $4.5tn in the domestic shadow banking system, says consultancy McKinsey, which will probably seek a new home in funds as regulators take measures to limit the sector.

Chinese asset managers could leapfrog their western competitors through digital disruption or they could scale up even more quickly by buying large foreign asset managers. China's full emergence into the global capital markets and the rise of Chinese mega asset managers will be the biggest regional shift in the history of asset management.

Third, passive will overtake active.

Today's global mix 25 per cent of assets managed passively versus 75 per cent active will flip.

We are starting to see the switch in US equities but fixed income will be affected as well. Active managers who sell "beta", or index return, dressed up as "alpha", or outperformance, will be disrupted out of existence.

As technology makes markets and access to information more efficient, asset allocation will become the new alpha. Portfolios will be constructed with exposures to traditional beta with long-term and durable investment factors such as momentum (hot stocks continue to outperform) and size (stocks with a small market capitalisation do better). These will be combined with true sources of manager outperformance which will be even more scarce and precious 10 years from now.

Fourth, environmental, social and governance investment will become business as usual.

In 2029, we will no longer be talking about ESG in terms of standalone investment strategies. The quality and consistency of such data and analytics will advance to the point where they will be fully incorporated by portfolio managers into their investment processes across all asset classes. These value drivers will become part of mainstream investment analysis and security selection. A company's ESG rating will be as important as its credit rating.

Fifth, climate change will be the biggest wild card for investors, involving the biggest challenge not only for our industry but for human life itself.

The question is whether our industry will take seriously the value creation, or destruction, potential that climate change brings.

Our industry still looks at climate as a matter of customer preference, rather than investment value. It is important to seize the opportunity to deploy capital to support climate change solutions. This is our moment to show the true value we can bring to the future of investing by embracing a shift in the way we operate as an industry.

HSBC's 10,000 job cuts are the logical answer in a CEO interview

Few job interviews involve actually doing the job apart, of course, from acting auditions, software coding challenges, and sub-editng tests (did you spot the error?) But it appears that banking group HSBC is now taking this approach. It has been letting Noel Quinn try out for the part of chief executive for two months, and he is evidently keen to impress. Weekend news reports suggest he is reviewing the future of bank's global equities business, as part of a plan to cut 10,000 jobs while securing a permanent one for himself.

When he was given the chance to act as interim CEO, after John Flint's was ousted by the board, Mr Quinn had not been many investors' preferred candidate. Last week, however, the Financial Times said that he had "worked hard to change their minds".

A few days later, insiders told the Sunday Times that "Quinn has a strong chance of landing the top job".

If he does, it will probably be because he has used his on-the-job interview to prove his strength in four disciplines: ? Logic. With lower-for-longer interest rates squeezing banks' lending margins, cost-cutting is the only logical way to support profit.

If you have 268,000 employees across 65 countries, staffing is the logical cost to cut. When your global equities business contributes 2 per cent of total group revenue, it is the logical place to start. Mr Quinn seems more than able to follow this progression.

? Technology. Investment banking and retail banking can both be made more efficient through use of automation and artificial intelligence.

Mr Flint spent more than a year avoiding changes to jobs and functions. Mr Quinn has suggested a more techenabled approach in just a few days. One banker told the Sunday Times: "Equity desks are becoming more automated it wouldn't be a shock if they take more bodies out." HSBC's First Direct business then told the FT how app-based tech can make it "more accessible to a wider population".

? Geography. HSBC derives 80 per cent if its profit from Asia, where it makes double-digit returns. It derives only an operating loss in Europe, according to S&P Capital IQ.

Yet analysts at Citi say 10,000 job cuts would be "equivalent to 17 per cent of total Europe full-time employees", indicating there are about 59,000 in total on the continent or 25 per cent of the group. Mr Quinn can see the geographical imbalance.

? Maths. Risks to revenue growth, from low rates and Hong Kong unrest, make it harder for high-cost-base banks, like HSBC, to maintain profits.

As Goodbody analysts note, "a bank that reports a 50 per cent cost-income ratio needs to deliver a 10 per cent cut in operating costs to maintain the same level of absolute profitability in the face of a 5 per cent decline in revenues". Mr Quinn can do this maths, it seems, leaving him well placed to get the job.

But a number of HSBC bankers may need to retrain as actors, coders, or sub-editers (if you spotted that one, apply to the address below).

HKEX s failed bid for LSE exposes a whole new realm of risk

The  clash of civilisations  is playing out in rising tensions between east and west

The failed attempt by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to buy the London Stock Exchange Group highlights the tensions between Asia and the west and the challenges facing any attempt to harmonise economic and political interests between the two.

I believe we may have reached the inflection point in global geopolitics mooted by Samuel Huntington in his seminal 1993 article  The Clash of Civilizations .This is now a reality that will affect trade, commodities and financial markets in dramatic and unpredictable ways.

The environment is way more complex than in the 1990s. Technology has moved on, and in 2019 we must add the additional factors contributing to the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) environment we now live in: artificial intelligence and big data, cyber warfare, climate change, populism and so on. Set against these new threats, the existing structures and models of risk and investment strategy are clearly insufficient to meet the challenges implicit in an increasingly opaque, digitalised playing field.

Writing from Hong Kong the IPO flow looks rosy once again after the successful conclusion of Budweiser and Top Sports. Bankers are merrily collecting their fees while out on the streets mayhem has broken out between the police and a disenfranchised youth and working class that see only diminishing job prospects and reduced social mobility.

Hong Kong has emerged as one of the ideological battlegrounds in this tectonic geopolitical shift: an increasingly dysfunctional capitalist model with no unifying focus or strategy facing the Chinese model of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has a clear strategic vision of alternative governance.

It is no surprise to find western business leaders caught in the crosshairs of these conflicting ideologies. Beijing is well aware that western multinationals are desperate to benefit from the largest growing consumer market in the world, which, unlike India and Indonesia, already boasts a world-class infrastructure. Western financial services institutions are desperate to tap the huge potential of China s capital markets.

So why would they resist pressure exerted discreetly or, as we have seen recently, quite openly, to comply with Chinese requirements? The message is clear: if you want to be a player in our market, then you follow our rules and criteria, even when they appear directly opposed to long-cherished western standards of governance and individual rights.

In the midst of the current protests, therefore, it seemed remarkable to many that HKEX chief executive Charles Li suddenly launched a bid for the LSE. Was the timing coincidental, or was the bid a deliberate attempt to highlight that Hong Kong remains open for business and especially the financial sector on which it thrives?

There are three widely offered explanations for his bid:

1. It was an audacious attempt to take HKEX on to the international stage and gain the scale and technology it needs to compete with the big players such as ICE and CME.

2. It was a cynical ruse to acquire LSE at a substantial discount when the UK economy is in the midst of a political and potential economic crisis.

3. It was a strategic move to obtain an influential foothold in the European market to counterbalance the decoupling currently pursued by the US.

The first explanation is the simplest and, in my view, the most likely. Across the world, exchanges are under pressure and margins are being squeezed, so scale and technology really matter. LSE would provide not only access to one of the world s oldest and most respected exchanges but also Borsa Italiana, FTSE Russell (which recently declined to include Chinese bonds in its index) and clearing house LCH, globally the largest processor of dollar-denominated swaps.

Such a merger would also provide an unparalleled 18 hours of trading time between Asian and European markets. For Mr Li, the acquisition would realise his long-cherished ambition for HKEX to be the pre-eminent  Chinese exchange for the world    a fully functional channel for bonds and equities between mainland exchanges and global capital markets. In the light of LSE s move to acquire Refinitiv, he could not hold back any longer.

Of course, LSE has taken a very different view of its future   not surprising, given that it managed only four IPOs in the past quarter. While voicing enthusiasm for the direct stock connect link with the mainland exchanges starting with Shanghai, LSE envisages a transition from the shrinking margins and competition of financial trading to data analytics as the new driver of value, hence its bid for Refinitiv.

Chief executive David Schwimmer s abrupt dismissal of the HKEX bid leaves little room for doubt that he and his board view HKEX as a subset of the mainland exchanges and have no intention of surrendering control to an entity indirectly responsible to the Chinese government. They look at the management structure of HKEX: the government is the largest shareholder and the board consists of six normal directors, six directors appointed by government plus one senior director and Mr Li. They look at the largest customer: effectively the Chinese state. They look at the company s lifespan in its current jurisdiction and the likelihood of its coming directly under central government control in just 28 years.

What is remarkable about the bid is, first, its apparent lack of political and regulatory awareness. I stress  apparent  as, surely, HKEX s advisers must have warned that the UK government and US regulators would try to block such a transaction? Or was the bid launched deliberately to test the UK s resolve at a time of weakness, given that there is no clear legal basis for government intervention? After all, an exchange is not obviously a strategic asset like, say, a defence company.

Second, what level of support, if any, did Mr Li have from Beijing? We all know that the move was criticised the day after its announcement by the party s organ, the People s Daily, which made the point very clearly:  Shanghai is designated as China s future financial centre, so whose future has more potential: Shanghai or Hong Kong?  And more to the point:  The China opportunity is not divisible and cannot be divorced from the big picture of China s overall rejuvenation, and must show conformity and consistency with the overall development interests of the country. Shanghai is right at the centre and 100% aligned with this development .

So, had Mr Li failed to consult Beijing and simply gone ahead in the expectation of its support? Surely, it would be highly presumptuous to assume that Beijing would publicly give preference to Hong Kong over Shanghai and Shenzhen, especially at a time of such political and social chaos in Hong Kong? Or knowing this, did he choose to ignore it?

I cannot be sure of the answer to these questions, but my assumption is that he simply factored in Beijing s likely public disavowal and, having delayed the bid for more than a year, saw this as the last chance for HKEX to strike a truly transformative deal that would place it among the top three global exchanges. There may have been tacit encouragement from some quarters in Beijing, who recognise the challenges facing the financial services industry in China, given the capital controls that remain in place.

As for the merits of the bid, Mr Li s argument that Hong Kong is an essential gateway connecting Chinese and international markets and will remain so as long as China maintains its strict capital controls, may be a convincing one given the continuing issuance of Chinese debt and IPOs.

But Hong Kong has less to offer in terms of enhanced market access for international investors. Inclusion of the Shanghai bourse in the MSCI Emerging Market index and the opening of the securities brokerage sector to foreign participation was hailed as a game-changer. Moreover, the failures of regulation exemplified by the 2015 Chinese stock market crisis and the ever-present threat of government intervention will ensure a high risk attribution to Chinese equity investment.

Despite grand statements about market opening, no change has so far been made to the limits on foreign ownership of domestic listed companies. China still restricts foreign ownership in its Chinese-listed A stocks to a maximum 10 per cent in individual companies, while foreign markets have no similar limits on Chinese investment, much of which is effectively sanctioned and directed by Beijing. This hardly constitutes  mutual benefit  nor a level playing field, and over the past year we have seen a tightening rather than a relaxation in cross-border capital flows.

Will the bid be resuscitated after six months? I doubt it. HKEX would have to raise its offer appreciably, there are huge regulatory hurdles to overcome, and no transaction will be possible without political blessings from both sides.

The attempted HKEX-LSEmerger exposes a whole new realm of risk in the conduct of global financial markets. Such risks are consistently underpriced. Markets are selectively responsive to the vulnerabilities in the global economy and often ignore high political risk factors such as Brexit: in common with other major markets, the FTSE is up 10 per cent this year despite its political quagmire and potential economic repercussions.

The advent of big data and AI-enabled trading will greatly add to the potential for market manipulation and instability. It is surely time for governments and their regulators to be proactive. If they cannot bring opposing sides back from the progressive political and economic decoupling under way, then at least they should start to create a new framework for governance and dispute resolution in global financial markets, to avert a major disaster that threatens to make previous financial crises look like mere storms in a teacup.

Good day. U.S. regulators have sued Telegram Group Inc., which had raised $1.7 billion in a token offering, in the latest blow to crypto startups, many of which were backed by venture-capital firms.

The SEC on Friday said it obtained a legal order to stop Telegram from distributing its cryptocurrency tokens, the Journal reported. Telegram, which has a popular encrypted messaging app, had raised funding from several venture firms including Lightspeed Venture Partners, in addition to hedge funds and other investors.

A number of other venture-backed startups had raised capital and have yet to distribute their tokens. The SEC's move could put some of those other tokens in jeopardy.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Anti-hype? Jackson Square Ventures, which has raised $193 million for its third early-stage fund, says it stays away from areas that are too popular with the majority of the venture industry, WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron reports exclusively. It had originally targeted $150 million.

* The firm's previous two funds, closed in 2011 and 2016, were each about $120 million.

* The San Francisco firm considers itself "anti-hype" because it doesn't invest based on a team's prior success or which other investors are involved but rather on its due diligence of a company's business and customers.

* It often goes after companies in its specialty of cloud, mobile or marketplaces, as well as startups working in traditional industries that might seem boring to others, Managing Director Josh Breinlinger said.

* Six of the firm's 57 companies have had an exit or valuation of at least $1 billion, including DocuSign Inc. and Upwork Inc., which went public.

We funding. SoftBank Group Corp. has prepared a financing package that would give it control of WeWork and further sideline its founder Adam Neumann in exchange for relieving the shared-office startup's looming cash crunch, the Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter.

Latin America deal. Uber Technologies has reached a deal to buy a majority stake in grocery-delivery company Cornershop, as the company continues to expand its reach beyond the core ride-hailing business, the Journal reports. Cornershop is backed by Accel, ALLVP, Creandum and Jackson Square Ventures.

Playground departure. Android software creator Andy Rubin has left Playground Global, the venture-capital firm he co-founded, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports. Playground bought back Mr. Rubin's stake in May when he departed, and Mr. Rubin no longer has an active role at the firm, the person said. The news of Mr. Rubin's departure from Playground was earlier reported by BuzzFeed.

Vaccine delivery. The Ghanaian government is in talks with venture-backed automated-logistics company Zipline Inc. to start delivering the malaria vaccine to remote locations via drones, a service it already provides for other products, including intravenous antibiotics, blood platelets and snake antivenom, the Journal reports.

Cashierless battle. Amazon.com Inc. recently opened its fourth cashierless convenience store in San Francisco, all located within a few blocks of each other. Nearby, Zippin and Standard Cognition are each demonstrating their own technology that they envision powering cashier-free stores across America, the Journal reports.

Exits

Biopharmaceutical company 89bio disclosed plans for an initial public offering on Friday. The clinical-stage drug company is developing potential therapies for the treatment of liver and cardio-metabolic diseases. Its lead product, BIO89-100, is being developed for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Based in San Francisco, 89bio's major shareholders include OrbiMed Advisors, Longitude Venture Partners, RA Capital and Pontifax.

Sportradar, a sports data and content provider backed by TCV, acquired sports betting and gaming omnichannel platform Optima for an undisclosed amount.

VC Funds

Day One Ventures closed its first fund at $20 million. The San Francisco- and New York-based firm makes seed and Series A investments of between $100,000 to $1 million per round. Recent investments include plastic-free and zero-waste lifestyle shop Package Free and workplace training service Hone.

Trust Ventures is seeking to raise $100 million for its second fund, according to a regulatory filing. The Austin, Texas-based firm counts nuclear energy startup Oklo, remote eye care provider Visibly and plant-based food company Emergy in its portfolio.

Tech News

The lesson I learned from Steve Jobs. A challenge from technology's greatest showman led Marc Benioff to a breakthrough insight about how to find true innovation at Salesforce.com.

EU warns of 5G risks amid scrutiny of Huawei. European Union analysis cites new security risks related to telecom infrastructure and suppliers.

HSBC s 10,000 job cuts are logical answer in CEO interview

Reports that interim boss is reviewing future of equities business make sense

Few job interviews involve actually doing the job   apart, of course, from acting auditions, software coding challenges and sub-editng tests (did you spot the error?). But it appears banking group HSBC is now taking this approach. It has been letting Noel Quinn try out for the part of chief executive for two months, and he is evidently keen to impress. Weekend news reports suggest he is reviewing the future of bank s global equities business, as part of a plan to cut 10,000 jobs  while securing a permanent one for himself.

When he was given the chance to act as interim CEO, after John Flint s was ousted by the board, Mr Quinn had not been many investors  preferred candidate. Last week, however, the Financial Times said he had  worked hard to change their minds . Then, a few days later, insiders told the Sunday Times  Quinn has a strong chance of landing the top job . And if he does, it will probably be because he has used his on-the-job interview to prove his strength in four disciplines:

 " Logic. With lower-for-longer interest rates squeezing banks  lending margins, cost-cutting is the only logical way to support profit. If you still have 268,000 employees spread across 65 countries, staffing is the logical cost to cut. When your global equities business contributes only 2 per cent of total group revenue, it is the logical place to start. Mr Quinn seems more than able to follow this progression.

 " Technology. Investment banking and retail banking can both be made more efficient through use of automation and artificial intelligence. Mr Flint spent more than a year avoiding changes to jobs and functions. Mr Quinn has suggested a more tech-enabled approach in just a few days. One investment banker told the Sunday Times:  Equity desks are becoming more automated   it wouldn t be a shock if they take more bodies out.  HSBC s First Direct business then told the FT how app-based technologies can make it  more accessible to a wider population .

 " Geography. HSBC derives 80 per cent if its profit from Asia, where it makes double-digit returns. It derives only an operating loss in Europe, according to S&P Capital IQ. Yet analysts at Citi say 10,000 job cuts would be  equivalent to 17 per cent of total Europe full-time employees , indicating there are about 59,000 in total on the continent   or 25 per cent of the group. Mr Quinn can see the geographical imbalance.

 " Maths. Risks to revenue growth, from low rates and Hong Kong unrest, make it harder for high-cost base banks, like HSBC, to maintain profits. As analysts at Goodbody note:  A bank that reports a 50 per cent cost-income ratio needs to deliver a 10 per cent reduction in operating costs to maintain the same level of absolute profitability in the face of a 5 per cent decline in revenues.  Mr Quinn can do this maths, it seems.

That leaves him well placed to get the job. But a number of HSBC bankers may need to retrain as actors, coders, or sub editers (if you spotted that one, apply to the address below).

Superdry s super man

What does Julian Dunkerton, founder of retailer Superdry, sing in the shower, asks Kate Burgess. Lombard bets it is a version of Carly Simon s 1977 hit:

 Nobody does it better,

Makes me feel sad for the rest,

Nobody does it half as good as me,

Baby, I m the best! 

Mr D has signed a new contract keeping him as Superdry s top executive until April 2021. It is six months since the Superdry founder was made interim chief executive while he took the group back to its  design-led roots . Now he will be there another 18 months and not as interim CEO.

Peter Williams, chairman since April, says without obvious irony that  interim  seemed a bit short-term. Mr D will be gone by 2021, he says. Meanwhile, the new board has more time to search for a long-term chief executive. Lombard can, however, see a time when people talk about Mr D as they do of octogenarian Leonardo del Vecchio. The appropriately named billionaire left his Luxottica eyewear business in 2004, returned a decade later, and shows no signs of retiring.

Corporate history is littered with examples of founders who make a comeback. It worked well in the case of Steve Jobs of Apple, Steve Morgan of Redrow and Malcolm Walker of retailer Iceland. It did not go so well at Photo-Me International when septuagenarian Serge Crasnianski returned to run the booth operator on an interim basis but stayed on because it was, he said,  difficult to find the right guy . Relinquishing power the second time is often harder than the first.

Pension schemers

Among the legislation in the Queen s Speech is a Pension Schemes Bill that, according to the prime minister s office, will allow action to be taken against those who  recklessly risk  people s futures. But the big question is whether it could force companies with pension deficits to suspend dividends. Or should that be  prorogue  them?

F acebook founder Mark Zuckerberg says that Elizabeth Warren is an "existential" threat to the company. That may be true. The Democratic presidential candidate would like not only to break up Big Tech, but tax companies such as Facebook and people like Mr Zuckerberg a lot more.

The question is whether she will get the nomination (I believe she will), win the election (also very likely, particularly if there's a recession in the US) and then be able to push her proposals through.

I think the rich should pay more taxes, particularly on their investment income. It galls me not that I pay roughly half my income in taxes, but that I do so because I earn it from actual work while those who earn money from rising share prices pay much less. Changing this is a core point in The Triumph of Injustice, a book by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who are advising Ms Warren on tax issues, including the details of how to tax wealth rather than just income.

But for many Americans, Ms Warren's ideas are contentious. Just say the word "redistribution," and even many Demo-crats become nervous. Also, unless the Democrats take both houses of Congress, putting through this kind of major tax reform would be very difficult, since Republicans of all stripes oppose the idea.

But what about "pre-distribution"? That is a term used by Nathan Gardels and Nicolas Berggruen. The co-founders of the Los Angeles based Berggruen Institute are pushing the idea of a national sovereign wealth fund that would address the imbalance of economic power that currently exists between rich companies and individuals, and the public sector.

Such a fund could, for example, take stakes in companies that profit from public investment or public data. Digital companies including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon would certainly fall into that category. Their products are largely built on things funded by federal government research the internet, GPS, touchscreens or on the use of personal data. Silicon Valley is not the only place that has benefited from such data and research so have most US companies that profit from products that are rich in intellectual property.

Expropriating the equity of existing companies is neither fair nor politically feasible; one shouldn't change the rules of the game post facto. But buying or demanding stakes in new ones might be. Norway and Singapore have state-run wealth funds, and Israel is starting one. In Germany, the state owns stakes in big companies. In both cases, the profits from which are used in the public inter-est. Even commodity-rich US states like Alaska and Wyoming have experience managing and distributing profits from natural resources in the public interest.

Sharing the wealth of companies that benefit from taxpayer funded research or seed investment with a broader group of constituents is an idea well suited to our new era of "stakeholder capitalism". It may also be necessary in an era of digital capitalism in which officials are struggling to find the best way to capture corporate wealth that can move anywhere.

As the OECD recently put it in a consultation for new ideas on tax for the digital age, "the allocation of taxing rights can no longer be exclusively circumscribed by reference to physical presence. The current rules dating back to the 1920s are no longer sufficient to ensure a fair allocation of taxing rights in an increasingly globalised world."

The world may feel slightly less globalised these days, but data and IP can still move anywhere. Meanwhile, we are shifting to an economy that will be based more and more on intangibles. That brings with it profound changes in the labour force, displacing better-paying jobs as software, robots, and artificial intelligence do more. Between this and the growth of the gig economy, it's clear that wealth will need to be captured and shared in new ways, lest society become ever more bifurcated. It is appropriate that California, where much of this productivity-enhancing and yet job-displacing technology was created, is also leading the way in finding solutions. In 2016, the state created an investment fund for all citizens, including those whose employers do not offer retirement plans (only about half of Americans have them, and that share is likely to decline as freelance work and the gig economy grow). It is easy to imagine the Californian vehicle being expanded along the lines of Singapore's Central Provident Fund, a compulsory saving plan that both employers and employees pay into and citizens can use to fund not just retirement, but also healthcare or housing. But the question is how to fund such a state plan beyond individual contributions. California could start its own sovereign wealth fund with the penalties it imposes on companies that will inevitably violate its new digital privacy rules, which are stricter in some ways than those in the EU.

The funds could be used to support infrastructure improvements, or doled out to ordinary citizens via individual plans that could be tapped for everything from education to healthcare needs to pensions.

Such a plan would address the imbalance of power between the state and the private sector, a crucial issue for Democrats, while preserving the individual choice beloved of conservatives. A rare win-win in economic policy.

TGIF! Names count for a lot and reputations drive plenty of deals, to be sure. But WSJ Pro's Will Louch offers a look at an instance where both factors apparently failed to attract enough investment to get a new strategy off the ground for London-based Metric Capital Partners. The private credit firm had aimed to raise a $500 million private-equity fund in partnership with British billionaire Richard Branson. But things didn't go as planned.

Meanwhile, pressure from social activists and Democratic politicians in Washington led by private-equity bte noire Elizabeth Warren apparently helped convince Platinum Equity to regroup its Securus Technologies Inc., a portfolio company that has taken heat over operating prison phone systems. WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming reports that the company has created a new structure that isolates that part of its business. On the M&A front, WSJ Pro's Luis Garcia has a look at a transaction involving a technology company in an unusual corner of the education market.

Finally, the deals market reawakened in a big way Thursday and we have news on transactions from Tokyo to Paris, London and all over the U.S.

So please, read on for all the details...

Today's Top Stories

A Private-Equity Partnership With Richard Branson Stalls

Early last year, John Sinik, managing partner of London-based private-credit firm Metric Capital Partners referred to Virgin Group founder Richard Branson as "one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our lifetime," WSJ Pro's Will Louch reports. The praise was part of a preliminary pitch for a $500 million fund that Metric hoped to raise in partnership with the U.K. billionaire to back fast-growing consumer brands across Europe and the U.S. But the partnership hasn't gone as planned. Fundraising has since been put on hold, according to people familiar with the matter.

Platinum Reorganizes Prison-Phone Operator Targeted by Warren

Platinum Equity is overhauling portfolio company Securus Technologies Inc., an operator of prison-phone systems that has come under fire from prison-reform activists for the prices it charges inmates and from Elizabeth Warren over profiting from incarceration. The changes are intended to transform the Dallas business from a prison phone-services provider into a diversified technology company, Securus said Thursday. The prison-phone operations are being split off from other lines of business focused on payments and technology services outside the prison sector, with all three units held by a new corporate parent called Aventiv Technologies.

Alpine-backed Riverside Buys Assessment Systems Provider ESGI

Riverside Insights, a provider of educational and clinical assessments that is backed by Alpine Investors, has acquired peer ESGI LLC to expand its offerings to include the earliest education settings for young children. ESGI provides software-as-a-service to educators for administering, creating, tracking and reporting assessments of youngsters in pre-school, kindergarten and early primary grades. Alpine formed its portfolio company from a coporate carveout from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co. last year.

Apax-Warburg Group's $3.4 Billion Deal for Inmarsat Nears Approval

A $3.4 billion proposal to acquire British satellite company Inmarsat PLC by a group that includes private-equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus is nearing government approval. The U.K. culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, said Wednesday that she considers undertakings offered by Inmarsat and Connect Bidco the consortium that agreed to buy it in March to mitigate national-security risks are appropriate and that the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority found no competition issues arising from the deal. The buyout group also includes the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board.

East West Capital Partners and other shareholders of Sonnet BioTherapeutics Inc. have agreed to acquire a majority of the stock of Chanticleer Holdings Inc. as a back-door way to become a publicly traded biotechnology company, while Chanticleer plans to spin off its restaurant operations, which include Hooters and American Burger Co., into a new business entity. Under the plan, Sonnet shareholders would acquire 94% of Chanticleer stock, with Chanticleer investors retaining the rest. Sonnet has agreed to pay Chanticleer $6 million.

MedData serves more than 10,000 physicians at a network of more than 3,000 facilities nationwide, the company said. Mednax said it will receive about $250 million in cash, as well as economic consideration of up to $50 million depending on the performance of MedData. The deal is expected to close during the current quarter.

Blackstone Group Inc. has offered 5,000 yen ($46.35) per share for Tokyo-based hotel operator Unizo Holding Co., but the company rejected the sweetened bid on Thursday. The offer was made initially last month through Blackstone Singapore Pte. Ltd. and was increased on Monday, Unizo said. The company also said a Japanese investment fund offered to buy the company on Tuesday, but its bid also fell short. Unizo didn't name the failed suitor. Regarding its rejection of Blackstone's bid, Unizo cited issues over control and Blackstone's potential exit. The company's shares closed at 4,540 yen on Thursday, Reuters reported.

Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Inc.'s bid to take private renewable energy company PNE AG at an equity value of about  ¬300 million ($330.7 million) won approval from the company's management and supervisory boards, allowing the firm to offer  ¬4.00 a share in cash for outstanding PNE stock. PNE said the bid represents a 31% premium to the unaffected share price of  ¬3.05 on Aug. 26. The firm must win acceptance of more than half of the Cuxhaven, Germany-based company's shareholders for the deal to move forward, and said it already has a completed deal for 11% of the stock. PNE develops and operates wind-energy projects both on land and offshore.

Private Equity Analyst asked senior professionals from across the industry to share their views on how technology is affecting the industry.

Wil VanLoh, Chief Executive, Quantum Energy Partners

In what ways has the digital revolution affected your firm's operations? Where has it had the biggest impact?

The digital revolution redefines everything about how we work and make decisions. It's a complete paradigm shift from how we used to do things. It's not a destination, it's a journey. We see the digital transformation as an enabler to 1) work smart automation of inefficient processes; 2) collaborate effectively through digital platforms; 3) manage information and data centralized data and digital documentation; 4) bring intelligence into our investment decisions data analytics; and 5) utilize historical data to build a strong foundation for the future through predictive modeling and artificial intelligence.

The biggest impact is achieved by trustfully incorporating AI and ML into our daily activities, guiding our investments decisions, empowering our portfolio companies and identifying investment opportunities. Our end goal is not only to transform how Quantum runs our business, but also to help our portfolio companies to go through the same digital transformation so they have the tools to compete on a level playing field with larger public companies.

What do you see as the biggest challenge (or challenges) facing private-equity firms when it comes to technology?

Strategy: Developing a companywide digital transformation strategy will be a challenge to many PE firms because they will have to change the way they have always conducted business. Embracing new technologies requires cultural transformation beyond the digital transformation. There needs to be a strategy embraced by the firm's most senior executives.

Team: The digital journey requires a combination of in-house and external talent and technology. A typical PE workforce never needed such talent. There needs to be a strong leader of the technology team to lead the digitization initiatives and recruit the right people.

Approach: The new frontier of technology- and data-enabled AI and ML has never been used by most PE firms to help make investment and other business decisions. One can be easily lost on where to begin. The core competencies that made the firm successful historically should drive the purpose of the digital transformation. Defining quick wins and building a common goal is critical.

Time and budget: As previously mentioned, this is a journey. It requires continuous improvement, evolution and development. In the early phase, defining the budget, milestones and timing is essential. The firm's leadership must understand that it may take time for the full potential of the digital transformation to be fully evident.

Apologies for the late delivery. We had some technical issues this morning.

Good day. While WeWork's IPO troubles have prompted talk of troubles on the horizon for late-stage companies with high valuations, some early-stage companies are being put on notice as well.

One seed venture firm has been telling its companies to raise more capital if they can, and to think about contingency plans for an economic downturn just in case. This wasn't a formal message to companies along the lines of Sequoia Capital's infamous 2009 "R.I.P. Good Times" presentation, but it is something the firm is telling its companies, this investor said.

While early-stage startups should be better insulated from late-stage companies in a downturn because they need less capital and have more time to grow, a downturn in the market would eventually filter down and affect many early-stage businesses.

Winter might not be here yet, and this is just one data point, but it might be worth preparing for nonetheless.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Spinout fund. Synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks Inc. has established a fund for the sole purpose of launching spinout companies, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports.

* The Boston-based startup it has formed a private investment vehicle called the Ferment Consortium. Existing Ginkgo investors including General Atlantic, Viking Global Investors and Cascade Investment have committed $350 million to the fund.

* Ginkgo is already one of the largest and most highly funded startups in the synthetic biology sector. The company has raised nearly $728 million and most recently was valued at $4 billion. Forming spinouts is another means of expanding the use of Ginkgo's custom bioengineering platform, which enables the creation of new materials for textiles, fragrances, food ingredients or drugs.

* Ginkgo said Ferment Consortium plans to focus on spinouts in mature industries such as waste recovery and raw materials, where synthetic biology isn't currently used but could potentially have an impact. Ginkgo couldn't be reached for details on how many companies it expects to launch, how much financing it will allocate per company and whether the spinouts will be fully independent.

Unicorn embrace backfires. Mutual funds that invested billions in big technology startups are now suffering losses in newly public companies and are being forced to mark down their holdings of private companies that are no longer investor darlings, the Journal's Jean Eaglesham and Coulter Jones report. The collapse of the initial public offering of WeWork parent We Co. and the steep decline of Uber Technologies Inc. shares and other recent IPOs have backfired on funds that hoped big stock gains would give them market-beating performances.

Warren and the Valley. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren talks of remaking capitalism from the ground up. Yet Ms. Warren does draw business support, in particular in Silicon Valley. In June, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted: "I don't agree with many of her proposals but I donated to Elizabeth Warren because SHE IS THE ONLY MAJOR CANDIDATE WITH STUFF WRITTEN DOWN." In an email, Mr. Palihapitiya predicted big tech wouldn't ultimately be one of the issues Ms. Warren prioritizes. The Journal's Greg Ip has much more.

Biotech IPOs cool. The once-hot market for biotechnology initial public offerings is cooling. German cancer drug maker BioNTech SE went public on Nasdaq Wednesday, raising $150 million by selling 10 million American Depository Shares at $15 apiece. The company previously planned to sell 13.2 million ADSs at $18 to $20 each. Shares traded down about 5% to close at $14.24. Last week Swiss biotech ADC Therapeutics SA canceled plans for a U.S. IPO. Through three quarters, 29 U.S. venture-backed drug startups had gone public, down from 42 during the same period of 2018, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

Self-driving deal. Autonomous electric delivery truck startup Einride raised $25 million in a Series A round it said would help expand the Sweden-based business into the U.S., the Journal's Patrick Thomas reports for Logistics Report.

The three-year-old startup, which has built a small fleet of stocky cargo vehicles that it calls "pods," said the new round was led by EQT Ventures and NordicNinja VC.

Visual analytics. Andreessen Horowitz said this week that earlier this year it led a funding round of $12.5 million in nine-month-old Silicon Valley startup Preset Inc., which makes a visual-analytics platform, Agam Shah reports for CIO Journal. "We think there is a massive movement towards data and any sort of tooling around data, including analytics, is interesting," said Martin Casado, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.

Construction-Industry Tech Takeover

Brick & Mortar Ventures invests across construction technology. Its founder, Darren Bechtel, joined WSJ Pro Venture Capital to discuss investing in the burgeoning construction-tech sector.

Q:

What is Brick & Mortar's investing strategy in construction tech?

A:

We're seeing the industry in the early stages of adopting technology. But in construction, trying something new is just introducing risk, so something has to have a meaningful [return on investment]. I believe in leveraging smarter tools, smarter equipment and adopting standard practices from modern-day manufacturing and supply-chain management. One way to look at it is to do the mental exercise of saying, "If there is a future where we have robots and drones doing autonomous construction, what are the necessary components?"

Q:

Is your focus more on technology that introduces incremental improvements, or the Moby Dick situation where construction as we know it could be upended?

A:

We look across the board. Given the magnitude of the construction industry, even incremental improvement could be massive opportunities. There's long been a disconnect between cool technology and actual use case. The early days of drones for construction [which fly over project sites and produce 3-D models] highlighted that.

Q:

Do you consider the broader economy's effect on construction when making investments?

A:

Yes, construction is cyclical. Now, there are ways to hedge against that. A risky bet, for example, would be something that is only applicable to one type of construction in a single ZIP Code. You can mitigate risk if you develop solutions applicable across large geographic areas or that's relevant to both commercial- and industrial-owned infrastructure.

Exits

Logistics-startup Flexport Inc. acquired Crux Systems, which tracks ocean containers, for an undisclosed amount. Flexport secured a $1 billion funding round in February that valued the San Francisco-based company at $3.2 billion. SoftBank Vision Fund led the investment, which included participation from Founders Fund, DST Global, Cherubic Ventures, Susa Ventures and SF Express.

Standard Cognition acquired fellow autonomous retail checkout technology provider DeepMagic for an undisclosed sum. In July, San Francisco-based Standard secured $35 million in Series B funding, giving the company a $535 million valuation, from EQT Ventures, Initialized Capital, CRV and Y Combinator.

Cannabis market analyst New Frontier Data Inc. has made its second acquisition this week with its agreement to purchase Civilized Worldwide Inc., a cannabis lifestyle and engagement platform. Earlier this week, Phyto Partners- and Verte Capital-backed New Frontier agreed to acquire Zefyr Inc.

Private Equity Analyst asked senior professionals from across the industry to share their views on how technology is affecting the industry.

Tricia M. Mackechnie, Chief Technology Officer, HarbourVest Partners

In what ways has the digital revolution affected your firm's operations? Where has it had the biggest impact?

The good news is that the pace of technology continues to accelerate, which means that there are more opportunities than ever for businesses to do three things: transform their relationship with data, improve operations and provide greater efficiency for their employees and clients. Specifically, implementing low-code business-process-management tools and integrating these tools with administration engines has created significant operating efficiencies and productivity gains. Using these technologies and frameworks allows us to deliver business capabilities faster through agile methods, while also applying continuous improvement techniques. What that means in plain English is better quality data, faster. It also means more efficient processes and better reporting. It's a win for our business, because our teams can do their jobs more efficiently and for our clients because we can offer them insights and information faster.

What do you see as the one or two biggest challenges facing chief technology officers/chief information officers in the private-equity industry today?

The pace of change means that adoption timelines get shorter. There used to be a burn-in period when it comes to adopting new technologies, but that's no longer the case. This rate of acceleration challenges the ability of our teams to manage changes within the business, as well as changes to the tools they use and the way they work and collaborate. To effectively keep pace with the rapid shifts in technology, companies need to approach these challenges not as simply a technology issue, but rather a business issue, and properly allocate time and resources to ensure adoption across the organization.

While the implementation of business capabilities enabled through technology has continued to evolve, the workforce is often challenged by legacy programs and business models. Today, change management is constant and essential to reskill your workforce as private equity takes advantage of more sophisticated tools. Whether that is data analytics, sophisticated cybersecurity tools or advanced CRM solutions, leaders will need to focus on preparing the workforce for the future digital skills that will be a necessity for where the industry is headed.

Private Equity Analyst asked senior professionals from across the industry to share their views on how technology is affecting the industry.

Brian Conway, Chairman and Managing Partner, TA Associates, Chairman and Managing Partner,

In what ways has the digital revolution affected your firm's operations? Where has it had the biggest impact?

TA's effort to leverage and implement technology across the entire ecosystem of the firm has yielded improved and more actionable data; numerous workflow efficiencies; and the introduction of new tools that have helped with managing day-to-day operations and improving mobility and productivity, particularly when on the road. The biggest impact, however, has been on our investment origination efforts. For example, we have enhanced our proprietary database through which investment prospects and portfolio company add-on acquisition opportunities are actively tracked and developed. [We also] developed applications to automate a variety of initiatives that were previously done manually and created a system that proactively alerts our team of current [or] prospective company news, as well as meaningful and timely data on various company growth metrics that we track.

What do you see as the one or two biggest challenges facing chief technology officers/chief information officers in the private-equity industry today?

On the risk side, cybersecurity has been one of the biggest challenges and remains a critical component of the technology landscape. On the opportunity side, I believe that eventually data science and machine learning will be more broadly adopted in private equity to help improve investment sourcing and decision-making, as well as portfolio operations.

Private Equity Analyst asked senior professionals from across the industry to share their views on how technology is affecting the industry.

Eric Feldman, Chief Information Officer, Riverside Co.

In what ways has the digital revolution affected your firm's operations? Where has it had the biggest impact?

Like other terms that capture the imagination, such as big data, digital revolution or transformation can mean different things to different people. For Riverside, its digital revolution has focused on evaluating the manual tasks managed across the firm. In thinking just about the operations of the management company, these permeate across the back office and amongst our investment professionals. Where a technology solution can add or create value, this has been our focus. Routine tasks, in particular, are very good candidates for automation, which would free up resources to focus on value-added work. In our 30-plus years of investing in smaller companies, we have amassed a treasure trove of data. Part of our strategy, as it relates to digital transformation, is to evaluate opportunities to make this data more accessible, easily digestible and creating touchpoints where external data commingles with our internal data to help inform our investment professionals as they research new investment opportunities. This will have a positive impact for Riverside.

What do you see as the one or two biggest challenges facing chief technology officers/chief information officers in the private-equity industry today?

A noticeable challenge today is the proliferation of data across disparate systems. Some of this data is controlled and managed by the firm, but also significant quantities of data are accessible publicly or through paid subscriptions. Weaving these data points together to ensure employees have real-time access to information can be a challenge. In the past, knowledge about a particular deal, for example, would be nicely confined to a traditional file server storing models, research material and information collected from data rooms. Anything you needed to know about that particular opportunity was a few clicks away. The abundance of information and the dozens of tools used for research make it so this type of containerization doesn't allow for easy access to information. Democratizing data so insights can be learned across an organization is a significant area of opportunity for many private-equity firms today.

VC Daily: RigUp Grabs $1.9 Billion Valuation; Andreessen's New Bio Partner; San Francisco Takes On Startups

Good day. After long serving as ground zero for tech companies to roll out new products without any government oversight or input, San Francisco has said "enough."

The city where Uber, Lyft and Airbnb started will create an Office of Emerging Technology, a one-stop shop that tech companies will have to work with before unleashing technology on the public. The office aims to control future unruly deployments, like those seen from ride-hailing and electric-scooter startups.

"I am often incredibly impressed by the ingenuity of start-ups and the pace of technological innovation," county supervisor Norman Yee wrote in announcing the new office. "But technology should serve the public's best interests, not the other way around."

As cities across the country grapple with how to control emerging technology, it remains to be seen whether San Francisco's move serves as a bellwether.

And now on to the news...

In the News

LinkedIn for energy. RigUp Inc., which runs a marketplace for contract workers in the energy sector, surged to a $1.9 billion valuation with a new funding, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports exclusively. With the new financing, RigUp's valuation has grown some 10 times since existing investors Founders Fund and Bedrock Capital co-led its Series B a year ago.

* Andreessen Horowitz led the $300 million Series D financing in the Austin, Texas-based startup, using its recently formed late-stage fund.

* David George, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz who is joining RigUp's board, said he came across the startup while looking for companies that could compete with LinkedIn. "We feel the way to go attack LinkedIn is through deep vertical specialization," Mr. George said.

* RigUp connects independent contractors such as heavy-equipment operators, maintenance workers and solar-panel installers with jobs in energy sectors such as oil and gas and renewables. Hiring companies include BP PLC and Parsley Energy Inc.

Bio partner. Andreessen Horowitz has hired a new general partner to invest in health care, as the venture firm responds to an increasing number of startups entering the sector, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports. Julie Yoo joins general partners Jorge Conde and Vijay Pande as the third partner investing out of the firm's bio fund, which backs early-stage startups in life sciences, biotechnology, digital health and health-care services.

Diabetes startup. ImmunoMolecular Therapeutics Inc. has raised $10 million to develop drugs that stop the progression of Type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Biotech companies are seeking new treatments for Type 1 diabetes, a condition in which the immune system destroys insulin-making cells. Patients now manage the disease by taking insulin.

AI funding. Clari Inc., a provider of an artificial intelligence-based sales and marketing platform, raised an additional $60 million to bring its total funding to $135 million, WSJ Pro's John McCormick reports. The Sunnyvale, Calif., software company developed a machine-learning system that allows businesses to better forecast and manage their sales and marketing. Sapphire Ventures led the round with participation from new investor Madrona Venture Group and existing backers Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital Ventures and Tenaya Capital.

Funds and games. The company behind Exploding Kittens, the popular card game that combines whimsical drawings of felines with cutthroat strategy, has sold a $30 million minority stake to a prominent media investor.

The nearly 5-year-old Exploding Kittens Inc. says it will use the new investment, from an affiliate of former News Corp. executive Peter Chernin's investment firm TCG, to develop more products, hire more employees and explore possible entertainment options, the Journal's Ethan Millman reports.

Exits

Cannabis market analyst New Frontier Data Inc. agreed to acquire Zefyr Inc., a data discovery and profiling platform for the cannabis industry, for an undisclosed sum. Washington-based New Frontier counts Phyto Partners and Verte Capital among its investors.

VC Funds

Bessemer Venture Partners has formally stepped into the growth equity arena, unveiling a $525 million fund specifically tailored to late-stage startups. Bessemer's growth team will target investments of as much as $250 million in companies they see as able to become sustainable $10 billion businesses. But the firm said it has been making growth investments since its inception, most recently in more than a half-dozen companies, including ACV Auctions Inc., a provider of online wholesale auctions for car dealers, and Toast Inc., which produces wireless point-of-sale systems and management software for restaurants.

AI Startup Clari Raises $60 Million in New Funding; Round brings total raised to $135 million

Corrections & Amplifications

Clari has raised a total of $135 million. The secondary headline on an earlier version of this article incorrectly said the company's valuation was $135 million. (Oct. 10, 2019)

Clari Inc., a provider of an artificial-intelligence-based sales and marketing platform, said Thursday it raised an additional $60 million in venture-capital funding to bring its total to $135 million.

The Sunnyvale, Calif., software company developed a machine-learning system, also named Clari, that allows businesses to better forecast and manage their sales and marketing.

Sapphire Ventures led the funding round with participation from new investor Madrona Venture Group and existing backers Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital Ventures and Tenaya Capital.

Clari, which was founded in 2012, focuses on the business-to-business market. Andy Byrne, its chief executive and co-founder, said the company has more than 250 customers, including Adobe Inc., Volkswagen AG's Audi brand and Okta Inc.

The platform links up with a corporation's customer-relationship-management software, calendar system, marketing-automation platform, email and other sources. It aggregates sales-related data, such as pending or closed sales, marketing-campaign statistics, customer contacts and other information.

Clari's AI then analyzes the data to make revenue projections and identify areas where sales might be at risk or where a customer might be open to making additional purchases. Clari's customers use those insights to, among other things, focus sales resources on closing a pending order or pitching extra products to a customer.

"[Our] thesis was that AI would transform revenue operations for every company on the planet," Mr. Byrne said. At many companies, he said, sales are still managed with an inefficient mix of status reports, spreadsheets and manual processes.

"It's really fascinating to see our customers are viewing revenue as not just an outcome, but as a business process that you can streamline and automate," said Mr. Byrne.

He declined to disclose the company's revenue, but said its contracts average "north of $130,000."

Okta, a provider of identity and access management software, uses Clari for sales forecasting. Okta Chief Executive Todd McKinnon said he uses the system almost daily to get visibility into how the company is doing.

"After you go from the high level what's the sales forecast, how it's trending then you can kind of drill into what are the deals that are making that up and what big deals have closed," he said.

Mr. McKinnon said the system's forecasts are very accurate and the tool is widely used inside his company. "It's very valuable for us. It's hard to quantify that. But the metric I would say back to you is that it's very heavily used," he said.

Hello. Attempting to subvert fraud, banks and other companies are matching device attributes, plus hundreds of data points about how we type, swipe and use a mouse, to specific customer accounts. Read about projects at Royal Bank of Scotland and TransUnion.

Also today: The rise of malware as a service or selling hacking tools online has allowed attackers to focus more attention on the health-care industry, according to new research.

Other news: Twitter may be in for heavy penalties, and many Mississippi's state auditor says government offices don't comply with cyber rules.

Keep your cards and letters coming: Let me know<mailto:kim.nash@wsj.com> what you think of our new site.

Biometrics and Fraud

Banks use AI to detect if it's really you. Financial firms are working to identify potential fraud by analyzing how customers hold their phones, how fast they type and other information about how they interact using various devices. Behavioral profiles, analyzed with artificial intelligence, can flag suspicious transactions before they go through.

Royal Bank of Scotland's director of innovation, Kevin Hanley, says the unusual use of a mouse helped the bank avert a seven-figure attempted fraud.

Read the rest of Mr. Hanley's story.

Hacking Groups

Sophisticated hackers are buying malware for targeted attacks. The rise of malware as a service or selling hacking tools online has allowed attackers to focus more attention on the health-care industry, WSJ Pro's Catherine Stupp reports.

Technology firms Thales SA and Verint Systems Inc. took a deep dive into the activity of 60 of the world's major hacking groups and found most are sponsored by nation-states. Just 12 of the 60 are straight up cybercriminals.

Big Number

500,000

Number of customers eligible to sue British Airways for compensation after its 2018 data breach, according to a U.K. court ruling cited in the Daily Mail. British Airways last year said about half a million passenger records were accessed in a cyberattack that took place between Aug. 21 and Sept. 5 of that year.

More Cyber News

Twitter's privacy gaffe could land company in hot water. Twitter Inc.'s admission that it collected telephone numbers from its users for cybersecurity purposes, and then used that information for targeted advertising, could result in heavy penalties, the Washington Post reports. A similar privacy breach by Facebook Inc. a number of years ago could provide a blueprint for regulators to slap Twitter with fines and other restrictions.

Mississippi auditor releases critical cybersecurity report. The state auditor for Mississippi published the results of a government-wide survey on cybersecurity policies on Oct. 1, revealing that many state agencies operate "as if they are not required to comply" with cyber rules. Around 38% of the agencies that responded didn't encrypt personal information such as health records, StateScoop reports, and only 71 out of 125 agencies responded at all.

European lawmakers warn of 5G risks. The European Union said that security risks from state-sponsored hackers will increase with the advent of 5G networks, Reuters reports. The report, which was prepared by member states, stopped short of singling out individual countries or technology companies but warned against over-dependence on one supplier.

Euronext targets data and private markets in new strategic plan

Euronext plans to push deeper into data, private markets and sustainable investing as part of a new three-year strategic plan it published late on Thursday.

Investors and analysts have been waiting for the company s new midterm targets to 2022 for much of the year after it hit some of its previous targets and missed others more than a year early.

Stphane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, said it would include expansions into asset classes like foreign exchange, data and analytics, post-trade services like clearing and a firm commitment to sustainable finance.

 We have planted the seeds and what we have done is move from a being a European exchanges operator to pan-European infrastructure provider,  he said.

Although Mr Boujnah has only been chief executive for four years, he is the among the longest-serving exchange bosses in Europe and spearheaded the exchange s expansion since it was spun out of Intercontinental Exchange in 2014. The former M&A banker oversaw Euronext s purchases of the Irish and Oslo stock exchanges of recent years. Euronext also owns the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon bourses.

He confirmed the group would look at further deals alongside the new plan, known as  Let s Grow Together 2022 .

It will replace the previous plan, known as  Agility for Growth , which aimed to cut costs and invest in new businesses. Mr Boujnah admitted some of the previous growth initiatives had failed.  The mistake was to promise too much. In the future we are going to continue to try, and even harder, but we are going to promise less. 

Euronext has targeted lifting organic compound annual revenue growth rate to 2 per cent to 3 per cent in the three years to 2022, up from the 2 per cent rate over the past three years. It will also aim to increase margins before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to more than 60 per cent in the same period, from the current level of 57 per cent. Its dividend policy to pay out 50 per cent of reported net income will be maintained.

Among the growth initiatives that failed were a push into commodity derivatives and 10-year venture with fintech provider Algomi to develop a fixed income trading venue.  We are exploring potential acquisitions in commodities, we will have to explore acquisitions in areas where we were not successful. Algomi is not an area we will pursue,  he said.

Venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz said this week that earlier this year it led a funding round of $12.5 million in nine-month-old Silicon Valley startup Preset Inc., which makes a visual-analytics platform.

"We think there is a massive movement towards data and any sort of tooling around data, including analytics, is interesting," said Martin Casado, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. The news was announced Wednesday.

Built on Apache Superset, an open-source analytics application, Preset provides more than 50 types of data visualization including charts and maps, said Maxime Beauchemin, the company's founder and chief executive.

Companies can use Preset's tools to make decisions on things such as sales cycles in specific geographic areas, Mr. Casado said.

Preset can connect to a range of data sources, said Mr. Beauchemin, who is also the creator of Apache Superset. He previously worked at Lyft Inc., Airbnb Inc. and Facebook Inc.

Preset's tools are being tested by a few customers, Mr. Beauchemin said. The company plans to offer the software via subscription, initially through Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services public cloud service.

Growing commercial use of data science and machine learning is bringing renewed interest in visual tools to present information, said Boris Evelson, research vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc.

"Process, data architecture, models it's kind of a mix of science and art. It's the art part that is very immature," Mr. Evelson said.

A "http://newvantage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Big-Data-Executive-Survey-2019-Findings-122718.pdf" of C-suite decision makers at Fortune 1000 companies by management consulting firm NewVantage Partners found that 21% said they invested $500 million or more in big data and AI in 2018, up from 13% in 2017.

Management: Europe's Old Schools Hatch New Firms --- Oxford and others aim to mirror U.S. rivals, moving innovations from lab into business

OXFORD, England -- The world's oldest universities are learning to promote their newest technologies using American-style entrepreneurialism.

Across Europe, academic institutions are intensifying efforts to get promising ideas out of their labs and into commercial use, following the successful examples of Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other U.S. leaders in the field.

Breaking with ivory-tower traditions, European schools are encouraging their academics to license technological breakthroughs or start businesses. The storied institutions are establishing tech-transfer offices and investment funds to speed commercialization.

"We've set up more companies in the past five years than in the previous 795," said Chas Bountra, University of Oxford's pro-vice chancellor for innovation, at a recent conference on artificial intelligence that touted Oxford's AI-related startups.

Oxford until 2014 established at most five companies annually using technology developed in its labs, trailing rival Cambridge University. Since then, Oxford has ramped up to at least 20 a year, lifted in part by Oxford Sciences Innovation, an investment fund set up in 2015 independent of the university. With GBP 600 million ($733 million) raised from global investors ranging from Invesco Ltd. and Sequoia Capital of the U.S. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. of China, it is the world's largest fund targeting academic spinouts.

Academics can find startup life liberating. "Universities and governments work at a very different speed," said Yiannis Ventikos, a professor of mechanical engineering who co-founded First Light Fusion Ltd., an OSI-backed spinout.

ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology where Albert Einstein studied, has spun out at least 20 companies annually since 2007, making it a world leader, according to Global University Venturing, a company that tracks spinouts.

Not every university has the potential to become another Stanford, seeding Silicon Valley, say spinout veterans. To succeed, schools must be in communities that nurture tech ecosystems, with financing nearby and veteran entrepreneurs willing to advise novices. Smaller, less-known universities and institutions in Southern and Eastern Europe lag behind the pacesetters.

At Oxford, which has quietly built a tech cluster, "alumni always want to come back to help," said Jim Wilkinson, chief financial officer of OSI, the investment fund.

U.S. research institutions began spinning out tech companies three decades ago, after Congress let them share in profits from federally funded research projects. Notable names include early search engine Lycos and robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics.

Europe moved more slowly to permit commercialization, and few academics felt comfortable crossing the line to business.

Wilfried Vancraen in 1990 had earned two master's degrees from Belgium's Catholic University of Leuven and was working for an industrial-research center when he was amazed by a precursor to today's 3-D printers. In cooperation with his alma mater, he established Materialise NV, a world leader in 3-D printing software and applications.

"It was all quite unorganized," he recalled of the founding, during an era when many professors shunned links to business. "There were certainly conflicting opinions on how to deal with university-industry relations."

Catholic University of Leuven now touts Materialise as a pioneer among its fast-growing list of spinouts. Leuven's region, Flanders, has created a 117 million euro ($128 million) fund, imec.xpand, to help bankroll university spinouts and other startups.

Today, universities from Scandinavia to Bavaria scour their labs for potential startups. France has created a national network to commercialize academic innovations. And universities across Southern and Eastern Europe are trying to catch up.

Prestige and public benefit motivate universities more than financial returns, said Thierry Heles, editor at Global University Venturing. Funding for lab research far outweighs financial returns from spinouts, he said.

ETH Zurich, funded by Swiss taxpayers, wants to persuade them "that support is worth the investment," said ETH Vice President for Research and Corporate Relations Detlef Gunther. "Our responsibility is to disseminate our technology into society."

Universities establish companies when they spot technologies emerging from their labs with real-world applications. Many innovations, which universities usually patent, are licensed for commercial use. Spun-out companies can stay independent, go public or get snapped up.

European academics increasingly dream of creating the next big thing in technology. Berlin-based GetYourGuide.com, a website offering customized travel that has raised $484 million in funding, was founded by four ETH Zurich graduates using machine-learning technology from the university, which offers graduate students free entrepreneurship classes.

"Naturally, I attended," said Chief Executive Johannes Reck, who studied computational neuroscience.

Nicholas Hawker in 2011 was getting a doctorate at Oxford in the math and computer science of simulations when his adviser, Prof. Ventikos, proposed starting a company to apply the research in energy generation. The duo founded First Light Fusion, which aims soon to hit critical milestones in generating electricity from bountiful hydrogen using a novel approach to nuclear fusion.

"I was and still am very academically oriented," said Prof. Ventikos, now head of the mechanical-engineering department at University College London, another big promoter of spinouts. By starting a company and raising private money, the duo were able to show results much faster than following traditional academic channels, Prof. Ventikos said.

AI Startup SparkCognition Raises $100 Million From Investors Including Boeing; Boeing, March Capital among investors in maker of AI-powered predictive tool

SparkCognition Inc., a startup developing artificial intelligence for industrial uses, raised $100 million in new funding from an array of investors, including Boeing Co.

The startup offers AI-powered tools to help predict when equipment might fail, among other services, that manufacturers and oil-and-gas companies can use.

The investment is a deepening of a long-term relationship for Boeing, said Brian Schettler, managing director of the aerospace company's venture-capital arm Boeing HorizonX Ventures. Boeing and SparkCognition last year launched a joint venture to develop an airspace-management software platform dubbed SkyGrid.

Venture firm March Capital Partners led the Series C financing for the Austin, Texas-based startup. Some high-profile businessmen also participated in the deal, including John Thornton, former president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Andrew Liveris, previously chief executive and chairman of Dow Chemical Co. Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., Singapore's state-investment arm, was also an investor.

Sumant Mandal, March Capital's managing director, said he was particularly attracted to the startup's ability to automate predictive maintenance services, which he said is typically done by consulting firms such as Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

"Customers are all looking to make this predictive maintenance automated," Mr. Mandal said.

Founded in 2013, SparkCognition's software can automatically create models that make sense of data coming from industrial sensors, among other services. The software uses artificial intelligence to reveal insights to help companies improve efficiency, cut costs and predict infrastructure failures, said SparkCognition founder and CEO Amir Husain. The technology can be applied to a variety of industries, including defense, utilities and financial services.

European oil-and-gas company Aker BP, for instance, uses SparkCognition's software on its offshore oil rigs to help identify and prescribe fixes for an array of pumps, compressors and rotating equipment, Mr. Husain said, adding that automating those services can help businesses save money.

SparkCognition also lists engineering and aerospace giant Honeywell International Inc. as a customer.

Boeing initially invested in SparkCognition in June 2017 and was the aerospace company's first external bet in AI, Mr. Schettler said. The pair's SkyGrid project is aiming to use AI to calculate routes for unmanned aircraft, taking into account a variety of factors including weather, payloads and arrival times to maximize the number of unmanned craft that can fly in proximity to each other, Mr. Husain said.

SparkCognition has raised a total of $175 million with the new funding.

Good day. The U.S. Commerce Department's decision to add 28 Chinese organizations, including eight companies, to its trade blacklist is a blow to the artificial-intelligence industry in China, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The companies, which were cited by the U.S. for their role in repression of Muslim minorities, are among the largest names in A.I. in China and the world ` and several are currently or formerly backed by U.S.- or China-based venture-capital or private-equity firms. The move could limit these companies' ability to access U.S.-based equipment.

The companies include iFlytek Co., surveillance-system producer Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., facial-recognition business companies SenseTime Group Ltd. and Megvii Technology Ltd. and Yitu Technology, which focuses on AI applications in cities, health care and business.

While U.S.-based A.I. startups typically don't compete directly with Chinese counterparts ` U.S. government agencies typically buy A.I. software from U.S. companies, for example ` any impact of the blacklistings on the U.S. A.I. market won't be clear for some time.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Biotech M&A. Fewer biotechnology startups are being acquired as a result of large pharmaceutical-company mergers and a strong market for initial public offerings, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports.

* Twenty U.S. VC-backed biotechs were acquired in the first three quarters of 2019, the fewest since the same number of biotechs were purchased in the same period in 2012, according to VentureSource, which is owned by WSJ Pro publisher Dow Jones.

* Last year, 28 venture-backed biotechs were purchased in the first three quarters, and 36 were acquired in the same period in 2017.

Vrde Partners Sets Up Insurance Venture With Former Apollo, Aflac Executives; The Minneapolis-based private-equity firm is expanding its investment strategy to target insurance deals

Vrde Partners is set to become the latest private-equity firm to expand into the insurance industry.

The U.S. debt and special situations specialist has struck an agreement to form a joint venture with Agam Capital Management LLC, an insurance provider in Teaneck, N.J., founded by senior former executives from Apollo Global Management Inc. and insurer Aflac Inc.

The joint venture will see Vrde aim to invest $500 million initially in life insurance, annuity and reinsurance assets. The firm, through the joint venture, will also use Agam's proprietary technology platform to provide services to the life insurance industry. Agam, set up three years ago by Avi Katz and Chak Raghunathan, uses analytics and machine learning to help insurers evaluate and manage risks.

The deal comes as many insurers are looking to sell off annuity products as they struggle to meet earnings targets amid low interest rates.

This, coupled with the insurance industry's large size, made it an attractive investment proposition for Vrde, Elena Lieskovska, partner and the firm's head of European financial services, said in an interview.

"Given the current landscape of historically low interest rates and fundamental regulatory and accounting changes, we believe the opportunity across the $23 trillion life insurance industry is huge," Ms. Lieskovska said.

Vrde is the latest asset management firm to bet that it can profit from investing in the insurance industry, following in the footsteps of larger counterparts like Apollo and Blackstone Group Inc.

The insurance industry has proven particularly profitable for Apollo, which set up Bermuda-based Athene Holding Ltd. in 2009. The company swiftly expanded under Apollo's ownership to become a leading player in the fixed annuity market, with assets under management rising to roughly $86 billion by last year.

Fixed annuities provide retirees and other consumers with a saving contract that pays buyers a guaranteed amount each year. Insurers can make money from owning the products by earning more on investing assets backing the products than they pay out to consumers.

Apollo listed Athene on the New York Stock Exchange in 2016 in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apollo-backed-athene-set-to-give-quiet-ipo-market-a-boost-1481228037" that valued the company at around $8 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.

Blackstone, which manages around $50 billion of fixed-annuity and other insurance assets, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-blackstone-insurance-is-next-big-push-on-route-to-1-trillion-asset-goal-11557312738" that it plans to double this figure over time and is actively buying fixed-annuity assets.

For Vrde, the transaction marks a widening of the firm's private-equity strategy into a new financial services sector. The Minneapolis-based firm, which manages around $14 billion in client assets, has previously invested in a variety of financial services companies and assets.

These include buying stakes in a London venture-capital firm, Property Innovation Labs, and U.K. bank Masthaven. The firm has invested more than $60 billion across credit, special situations, infrastructure and real estate since its 1993 founding, its website says.

Vrde closed its last flagship fund with just under $1.75 billion, including the general partner commitment, in March 2017. The firm began marketing its eighth flagship fund, Varde Fund XIII LP, last year and had raised at least $633.8 million by May 2019, according to regulatory filings.

In July, Vrde promoted co-Chief Investment Officer Ilfryn Carstairs to lead the firm alongside George Hicks, one of its co-founders, starting in January. Mr. Hicks will step back to become executive chairman of the firm in 2022.

Privacy and Facial Recognition

Governments should think about consequences before banning new tech, say participants at Nasdaq-NCSA cyber summit

Emerging technologies hit a barrier in privacy laws. As privacy laws continue to roll out in Europe, California and other regions, privacy and security experts disagree over how technologies including facial recognition, artificial intelligence and 5G should be regulated.

Some proposals to ban these tools or place strict restrictions on them could have undesirable repercussions, said Ruby Zefo, chief privacy officer at Uber Technologies Inc. "You want the right person picking you up in the car, not an impostor," she said.

Ms. Zefo and others at a cybersecurity event hosted by Nasdaq Inc. and the National Cyber Security Alliance Tuesday make the argument that judicious use of biometric tools can keep people safer.

Surveillance

FBI's use of surveillance database violated Americans' privacy rights, court found. The intelligence community disclosed Tuesday that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year found that the FBI's pursuit of data about Americans ensnared in a warrantless internet-surveillance program intended to target foreign suspects may have violated the law authorizing the program, The Wall Street Journal reports. The court also said the activity may have infringed on the Constitution's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.

Raw intelligence: The court concluded that the FBI had been improperly searching a database of raw intelligence for information on Americans raising concerns about oversight of the program, which as a spy program operates in near total secrecy. Tens of thousands of searches by the bureau in 2017 and 2018 were deemed improper.

No go: The Trump administration failed to make a persuasive argument that modifying the program to better protect the privacy of Americans would hinder the FBI's ability to address national-security threats, wrote U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who serves on the FISA Court.

Facebook's libra hits extra regulatory roadblocks in Europe. The European Union will introduce legislation aimed at preventing libra, Facebook Inc.'s proposed digital currency, from undermining Europe's single currency and being used as a money-laundering tool, WSJ reports. The move is one of the toughest regulatory responses so far. Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, told WSJ that the organization recognized that as libra is an emerging technology, "policy makers must carefully consider how its applications fit into their financial system policies."

California laws take aim at deepfakes. One law bans deepfakes in politics while another creates legal tools for individual victims fighting the use of false videos, such as in pornography, ZDNet reports. Satire and parody are exceptions.

Most presidential campaign websites fall short on security or privacy: report. An analysis of 23 presidential campaign sites by the nonprofit Online Trust Alliance finds security or privacy deficits at most of them, CSO Online reports. Seven websites got high marks, including those of Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.); Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.); former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke; Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.); President Donald Trump; and self-help guru Marianne Williamson. Poor privacy practices contributed to failing grades at the other 16 sites.

Banks Use AI to Detect if It's Really You; Royal Bank of Scotland prevented a fraudulent transaction thanks to a BioCatch tool that flagged a different person was using the account

Corrections & Amplifications

Data-analysis firm iovation Inc. says it has data about six billion phones, laptops and other devices. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was five billion. (Oct. 11, 2019)

Financial firms are working to identify potential fraud by analyzing how customers hold their phones, how fast they type and other information about mobile interactions and the strategy is yielding results.

Using artificial-intelligence tools to crunch behavioral data is often a more secure way to verify customers than traditional means such as passcodes, experts say. The Federal Bureau of Investigation"https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/centers/cybersecurity/_docs/fbi_cyber_pin/2019/fbi_pin-20190917_multi-factor_authentication.pdf" that cybercriminals can circumvent typical multifactor-authentication techniques. One way is by calling a telecommunications company, posing as a customer and getting a service agent to switch that person's phone number to the criminal's device.

The fraudster can then have the individual's bank send a one-time passcode to the phone and gain access to the target's bank account. The FBI outlined other methods criminals use to bypass systems at many banks.

Emerging technology can help a bank avoid such attacks that can lead to fraud, said Kevin Hanley, director of innovation at Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.

The bank uses fingerprints; voice prints, or measurable characteristics of someone's voice; and behavioral analysis in crime-prevention efforts, deploying different technology depending on how customers interact with different business units. Corporate accounts, for example, usually conduct business through desktop or laptop computers. Many consumers use the bank's mobile app or customer-service phone line.

Credit-ratings firm TransUnion last year "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transunion-to-acquire-anti-fraud-startup-iovation-1526680132" iovation Inc. which says it has data about six billion phones, laptops and other devices to offer consumer-authentication services to its business clients.

Using one iovation product, for example, an online retailer can collect attributes about devices that log into its website and associate those devices with specific customer accounts when they are used to log on again. Traits include location and attributes of the device hardware. Should a different device try to access a customer account, the retailer could be alerted and might ask the customer for more identifying information, said Greg Pierson, iovation's chief executive.

Royal Bank of Scotland uses biometric technologies, which rely on algorithms to analyze data points in seconds as a transaction happens, to help stop attempted fraud rather detecting it after it happens, Mr. Hanley said.

In one case, behavioral analysis helped the bank spot a suspicious transaction in its corporate banking unit. The bank uses a tool from BioCatch Ltd. that takes in about 500 attributes about customer habits. During the transaction, Mr. Hanley said, the system saw two anomalies that triggered alerts: the user moved around the bank's website using a mouse's scroll wheel and, when entering numbers, he or she hit the number keys above the top row of letters on the keyboard. The account holder, however, typically dragged the mouse and used the calculator-like keypad available on many keyboards to type numbers.

The user was trying to open a new account and transfer a seven-figure sum, Mr. Hanley said. Because the movements didn't fit the pattern Royal Bank of Scotland had on file for that customer, the bank immediately froze the account. Mr. Hanley declined to say whether the impostor was caught.

"You only need a handful of examples like this to prove the technology's worth," he said.

Royal Bank of Scotland is testing the technology for use in retail banking but the high number of individual customers presents challenges, he said.

The bank might have to increase the threshold of anomalies that would set off an alert to account for the vagaries of life. If someone breaks an arm and types more slowly while in a sling, for example, the bank wouldn't want to cut off transactions in error.

"You don't want to set it so sensitively that when one of 500 attributes is flagged, an alert is sent," he said. "That's learning we're doing now what is the appropriate level of tolerance."

OXFORD, England The world's oldest universities are learning to promote their newest technologies using American-style entrepreneurialism.

Across Europe, academic institutions are intensifying efforts to get promising ideas out of their labs and into commercial use, following the successful examples of Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other U.S. leaders in the field.

Breaking with ivory-tower traditions, European schools are encouraging their academics "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oxford-catches-up-to-cambridge-in-tech-1445904044". The storied institutions are establishing tech-transfer offices and investment funds to speed commercialization.

"We've set up more companies in the past five years than in the previous 795," said Chas Bountra, University of Oxford's pro-vice chancellor for innovation, at a recent conference on "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstones-schwarzman-gives-oxford-record-gift-of-188-million-11560898800?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2".

Oxford until 2014 established at most five companies annually using technology developed in its labs, lagging behind rival Cambridge University. Since then, Oxford has ramped up to at least 20 a year, boosted in part by Oxford Sciences Innovation, an investment fund set up in 2015 independent of the university. With 600 million ($737 million) raised from global investors ranging from Invesco Ltd. and Sequoia Capital of the U.S. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co. from China, it is the world's largest fund targeting academic spinouts.

Academics can find startup life liberating. "Universities and governments work at a very different speed," said Yiannis Ventikos, a professor of mechanical engineering who co-founded First Light Fusion Ltd., an OSI-backed Oxford spinout.

ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology where Albert Einstein studied, has spun out at least 20 companies annually since 2007, making it a world leader, according to Global University Venturing, a company that tracks spinouts.

Not every university has the potential to become another Stanford, seeding Silicon Valley, say spinout veterans. To succeed, schools must be in communities that nurture tech ecosystems, with financing nearby and veteran entrepreneurs willing to advise novices. Tenured professors outside Europe's startup hot spots often still balk at disrupting the routine of research, teaching, and publishing scholarly articles. Smaller, less-known universities and institutions in Southern and Eastern Europe lag behind the pacesetters.

At Oxford, which has quietly built a tech cluster, "alumni always want to come back to help," said Jim Wilkinson, chief financial officer of OSI, the investment fund.

U.S. research institutions began spinning out tech companies three decades ago, after Congress allowed them to share in profits from federally funded research projects. Notable names include Genentech, early search-engine Lycos and robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics.

Europe moved more slowly to permit commercialization, and few academics felt comfortable crossing the line to business.

Wilfried Vancraen in 1990 had earned two master's degrees from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-belgium-an-encryption-powerhouse-rises-1449791014" and was working for an industrial-research center when he was amazed by a precursor to today's 3-D printers. In cooperation with his alma mater, he established Materialise NV, which is a world leader in 3-D printing software and applications.

"It was all quite unorganized," he recalled of the founding, during an era when many professors shunned links to business. "There were certainly conflicting opinions on how to deal with university-industry relations."

Catholic University of Leuven now touts Materialise as a pioneer among its fast-growing list of spinouts. Leuven's region, Flanders, has created a  ¬117 million ($128 million) fund, imec.xpand, to help bankroll university spinouts and other startups.

Today, universities from Scandinavia to Bavaria scour their labs for potential startups. France has created a national network to commercialize academic innovations. And universities across Southern and Eastern Europe are trying to catch up.

Prestige and public benefit motivate universities more than financial returns, said Thierry Heles, editor at Global University Venturing. Funding for lab research far outweighs financial returns from spinouts, he said.

ETH Zurich, funded by Swiss taxpayers, wants to persuade them "that support is worth the investment," said ETH Vice President for Research and Corporate Relations Detlef Gnther. "Our responsibility is to disseminate our technology into society."

Spinouts also give research universities a quantifiable measure of success. "You could call it bragging rights," said James Mallinson, who for 15 years ran Oxford's tech-spinout portfolio and now funds spinouts at Oxford Investment Consultants, a private firm.

A few companies have gone big. Merck & Co. in 2017 bought Rigontec, a Bonn University spinout specialized in immunology, for more than $550 million.

Universities establish companies when they spot technologies emerging from their labs with real-world applications. Many innovations, which universities usually patent, are simply licensed for commercial use. Spun-out companies can stay independent, go public or get snapped up.

European academics increasingly dream of creating the next big thing in technology. Berlin-based GetYourGuide.com, a website offering customized travel experiences world-wide that has raised $484 million in funding, was founded by four ETH Zurich graduates using machine-learning technology from the university, which offers graduate students free entrepreneurship classes.

"Naturally, I attended," said Chief Executive Johannes Reck, who studied computational neuroscience.

Nicholas Hawker in 2011 was getting a doctorate at Oxford in the math and computer science of simulations when his adviser, Prof. Ventikos, proposed starting a company to apply the research in energy generation. The duo founded First Light Fusion, which aims soon to hit critical milestones in generating electricity from bountiful hydrogen using a novel approach to nuclear fusion.

"I was and still am very academically oriented," said Prof. Ventikos, now head of the mechanical-engineering department at University College London, another big promoter of spinouts. By starting a company and raising private money, the duo were able to build equipment and show results much faster than following traditional academic channels, Prof. Ventikos said.

Emerging Technologies Hit a Barrier In Privacy Laws; Governments should think about consequences before banning new tech, say participants at Nasdaq-NCSA cyber summit

NEW YORK As privacy laws continue to roll out in Europe, California and other regions, privacy and security experts disagree over how technologies including facial recognition, artificial intelligence and 5G should be regulated.

Some proposals to ban these tools or place strict restrictions on them could have undesirable repercussions, said Ruby Zefo, chief privacy officer at Uber Technologies Inc. She was speaking Tuesday on a panel at a cybersecurity event hosted by Nasdaq Inc. and the National Cyber Security Alliance, a nonprofit that works with the public and private sectors.

For example, she said, efforts to ban the use of facial-recognition technology could inhibit the development of tools designed to promote consumer safety.

Facial-recognition technology and other biometric tools can help companies like Uber authenticate drivers on behalf of customers, Ms. Zefo said. "You want the right person picking you up in the car, not an impostor," she said. "There has to be some leeway."

To make sure that an Uber driver's account is being used by that person, the company occasionally asks drivers for their photos to share with Microsoft Corp., which verifies them against previous images, according to an Uber "https://help.uber.com/partners/article/why-am-i-being-asked-to-take-a-photo-of-myself--?nodeId=7fa8a60d-cf6f-49ac-9a50-b4bf6a3978ef".

Lawmakers and privacy advocates have pushed back against the use of facial-recognition tools. In May, San Francisco "https://www.wsj.com/articles/san-francisco-poised-to-ban-facial-recognition-surveillance-11557840164" by city agencies, and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) has said he supports a federal ban on police use of the tools.

Another panelist Ben Voce-Gardner, director of cybersecurity and threat mitigation policy at New York state's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services agreed that efforts to safeguard privacy should be weighed against the benefits brought by certain uses of the technology. Facial recognition and similar tools allow government agencies to spot and monitor potential terrorists, for example.

"Facial recognition, if used properly, allows us to react faster to a potentially dangerous situation," he said.

But he said the technology should be limited, and agencies should be transparent in how they use it. "It's critical for the government to make the argument for why [facial recognition] is necessary," he said.

Similar privacy debates are being fought over emerging technologies including AI and 5G. New York City passed a law in 2017 to make algorithms more accountable, though city officials said earlier this year that progress has been slow, "https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/15/18309437/new-york-city-accountability-task-force-law-algorithm-transparency-automation". In April, Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) and Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) proposed the Algorithmic Accountability Act, which would require companies to assess automated systems for accuracy, bias and privacy.

Ms. Zefo said she disagreed with this approach, suggesting that a better solution is for companies to be transparent about the data they use to make decisions. Companies should also allow consumers to appeal decisions if they think they are biased, she added.

One step in overcoming these challenges might involve educating lawmakers on emerging technologies and how they affect privacy, said Mike Harasimowicz, a conference attendee.

"The problem we're having is we don't have enough policy makers and lawyers who understand [AI and facial recognition]," said Mr. Harasimowicz, chief operating officer at Next Peak Holdings LLC, a cybersecurity advisory firm. "I'm not sure if policy could ever keep up."

Good day. In 2013, Rob Rhinehart created Soylent, a meal-replacement drink, to do away with the inconvenience of, and time required for, preparing and eating food. The moment was immortalized in his blog post entitled, "How I Stopped Eating Food."

Reviewers weren't always so enthusiastic about the product. There were also product recalls in 2016. Still, his startup went on to raise some $71.5 million from Andreessen Horowitz, GV and others.

Now Mr. Rhinehart, who stepped down as CEO of Soylent in 2017, is back raising a venture fund, MarsBio, focused on bioscience companies. More below in today's newsletter.

And now on to the news...

In the News

From Soylent to VC. Rob Rhinehart, the biohacker known for co-founding meal-replacement drink startup Soylent Nutrition Inc., is raising a venture-capital fund to back early-stage bioscience companies, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports exclusively.

* Mr. Rhinehart said his firm, MarsBio, is seeking to raise up to $50 million to back Los Angeles-area startups working broadly across bioscience and biotechnology.

* MarsBio has invested in six startups to date, Mr. Rhinehart said. Portfolio companies include Karma Biotechnologies, a developer of drugs to treat autoimmune diseases that has raised nearly $3 million from investors including Khosla Ventures.

* Mr. Rhinehart has been a well-known figure in biotech circles since he co-founded Soylent in 2013. The nutrition drink was first marketed to engineers and other tech workers as a food replacement, and it attracted investors including GV and Andreessen Horowitz.

New fund alert. Venture-capital firm 83North, which targets Europe and Israel, has raised a new $300 million fund, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. The investment vehicle is 83North's fifth fund targeting consumer and technology companies. The firm's total capital under management is roughly $1.1 billion. 83North targets startups in enterprise software, data and cloud, and financial technology.

RNA editing. An entrepreneur who previously led gene-editing company Intellia Therapeutics Inc. has now co-founded Korro Bio Inc., a startup pursuing drugs in the new field of RNA editing, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Atlas Venture founded Korro last year and has joined with New Enterprise Associates to finance the company.

Media deal. Discovery Inc.-backed digital publisher Group Nine Media Inc. has agreed to acquire women-focused publisher PopSugar, the Journal's Benjamin Mullin and Lukas I. Alpert report. The all-stock deal values PopSugar at more than $300 million, according to people familiar with the matter, and will give its shareholders more than 30% ownership of the combined company. PopSugar's investors included Sequoia Capital and IVP.

Exits

Honda R&D acquired Drivemode Inc., which develops smartphone apps for car drivers, for an undisclosed amount. The Redwood City, Calif.- and Tokyo-based company was backed by investors including Incubate Fund.

VC Funds

Growth investor Winslow Capital Management has set its sights on raising $400 million for its second growth investment vehicle, Winslow Growth Capital Fund II LP, a securities filing shows. The goal doubles the firm's first growth fund target of $200 million, which was set in 2013. The strategy invests in late-stage startups as well as more seasoned businesses, and has no performance benchmark, Winslow said in an August regulatory filing. Winslow is owned by Nuveen LLC, the asset management arm of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. Nuveen had about $226 billion in alternative assets under management at the end of June, according to its website.

Jump Capital closed a new $200 million fund. The Chicago- and New York-based firm makes Series A and B investments of $4 million to $10 million per company focused on the fintech, media, information technology/data infrastructure and business-to-business software-as-a-service sectors.

Dubai-based BECO Capital closed its second fund at $20 million above its initial $80 million target to make early-stage investments in technology startups in the Middle East and North African region. Limited partners in BECO Fund II included Rimco Investment, International Financial Corp., Al Waha Venture Capital Fund of Funds, Warba Bank, Watar Partners and KAAF Investments.

Accelmed is seeking to raise $100 million for its Accelmed Ventures II fund. The firm is based in Israel and invests in Israeli medical-device and digital-health startups. Last week, AngioDynamics Inc. purchased Accelmed portfolio company Eximo Medical Ltd. for $46 million upfront, with $20 million dependent on the achievement of milestones.

Opening Quote: HKEX drops 32bn bid for LSE after charm offensive fails

Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what s happening in the markets

FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email.

The Hong Kong stock exchange has decided to walk away. Faced with a  put up or shut up  deadline on Wednesday, by which time HKEX either had to make a full, formal bid for the London Stock Exchange or sit tight for six months and watch while the LSE tried to consummate its proposed tie-up with data provider Refinitiv, HKEX has chosen the  shut up  option.

HKEX s unsolicited bid had faced a multitude of challenges, not least regulatory risk: traditional exchange mergers get competition watchdogs antsy, as the LSE found out with Deutsche Brse, and are also a red rag to politicians, who start defending  national champions .

Nevertheless, some LSE shareholders looked like they might be persuadable if enough cash was put on the table. But the timing of HKEX s bid   something out of its control given the $27bn deal LSE struck with Refinitiv over the summer   was perhaps the knottiest of problems since it tangled together concerns over governance with the Hong Kong protests. The ability of Hong Kong s government to appoint more than half of HKEX s board members at a time when the extent of its autonomy from China is under extreme scrutiny presented quite the challenge, both for shareholders and for the formidable US authorities.

Freed-up to complete the Refinitiv deal it wanted, the LSE s future as an information services business looks clearer and simpler. That deal still faces execution risks but the outside chance of another interloper must be diminished. With HKEX silenced, it should be a quieter next six months for the LSE.

Briefly

It s all going down in the telecoms towers business. Vodafone has said it could float its European towers unit in the next year or so. Helios Towers is already lined up for an IPO. Now Arqiva, the UK s largest tower company, has announced the sale of its telecoms division to Spain s Cellnex for 2bn. The deal follows reports in August that Arqiva, which is owned by a consortium including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Macquarie, was planning a break-up, two years after a failed IPO (there seem to be a lot of those around these days). Arqiva will keep (and fix) its broadcast business. Cellnex meanwhile has been on something of a deal spree   or  significant European expansion , as it calls it.

Easyjet s profits are lifting off thanks to the grounding of its rivals. The airline said it should achieve full-year pre-tax profits in the top half of its previous guidance range as a result of  increased demand due to disruption at British Airways and Ryanair  , with a headline figure of between 420m-430m. Passenger numbers climbed 8.6 per cent in the year to September, although planes were less full and revenues per seat at constant currencies were down around 2.7 per cent. However performance in the second half of the year was better than expected because of the strikes at its rivals.

Recruiter PageGroup has cut its profit outlook for the year after gross profit growth slowed from 7.4 per cent in the second quarter to just 2.1 per cent in the third. Operating profits for the full year would be around 140m-150m, PageGroup said, worse than it expected in July when it cautioned profits would be at the lower end of a 156.5m-168m range. A global macroeconomic slowdown and uncertainty across multiple markets has hit recruiters. Rival Robert Walters, also updating the market on Tuesday, said it expected its full-year profits to be flat on last year.

In true Silicon Valley style, Martin Sorrell is moving fast. The ad-king s S4 Capital s latest acquisition is of the region s digital marketing agency Firewood in a deal that values the Californian company at $150m. The cash-and-shares deal gives S4, the group Sir Martin launched a month after leaving WPP, a new hub in the US market to add to one in Amsterdam. He aims to double S4 s gross profit of 105m in 2018 within three years.

The latest victims of the City s jobs cull are employees at Grant Thornton and Lloyds Banking Group. GT is shedding around a dozen UK partners as it tries to halt a period of decline, while at Lloyds it is contractors who are in the firing line. The high street bank will tell thousands of freelance workers on Tuesday that they face losing their jobs or taking pay cuts of up to 30 per cent, because of a government crackdown on tax avoidance.

Job moves

Countrywide has recruited Bruce Marsh as its new chief operating officer as the estate agency group undergoes a turnround. Mr Marsh joins from Tesco where he was finance director for the UK and Ireland.

We re looking to feature more job moves. If you re in senior management and moving jobs or you know someone who is, let us know about it at quote@ft.com

Beyond the Square Mile

The US is looking at ways to funnel money to Huawei s European competitors such as Nokia and Ericsson as part of a wider push to fund a rival to the Chinese company. Officials have warned that Huawei is becoming dangerously dominant in the global race for the next generation of mobile communications.

Deutsche Bank has abandoned its ambitions to be a force on Wall Street, putting the lender s domestic retail operations front and centre of its restructuring efforts. Whether the unit s new boss Manfred Knof succeeds will go a long way in determining the fortunes of Germany s largest bank.

The Trump administration has added 28 more Chinese companies to the so-called entity list, which means suppliers will have to obtain a special licence to continue selling American-made goods to them. The organisations are principally involved in surveillance and artificial intelligence, and include Hikvision and Dahua, which make surveillance equipment.

General Electric is freezing retirement benefits for 20,000 longtime employees, spreading the pain of the conglomerate s turnround efforts to its staff. It is hoped the move will cut billions of dollars from its pension deficit and debt pile.

Closing quote   essential comment before you go

Brooke Masters

Don t let them eat cake: companies from KPMG to Uber have adopted extreme cost-cutting measures. But pinching pennies is all too often pound-foolish.

Michael Skapinker

The debate about who companies should principally serve   shareholders or a wider group, including employees   is more than a century old and has never been settled. But favouring the latter will not protect workers.

Cyber Risks Force Banks to Rethink Vendor Relationships; Usual means of assessing vendor risk are no longer appropriate, companies tell regulators

Hefty questionnaires have long been a favored method for banks to perform due diligence on service providers, but financial companies are suggesting to regulators that these are increasingly inadequate.

Vendor risk management is becoming a crucial area of cybersecurity, particularly as banks move operations to the cloud and asset managers hire third parties to manage their technology.

Banks worry that weak controls at technology providers could allow hackers into their own systems. Regulators are also concerned that a cyberattack that takes down a major financial company could destabilize markets.

Questionnaires, even long ones, "actually provide a limited understanding of the true business risks that a firm faces when using a vendor," said Jason Harrell, head of business and government cybersecurity partnerships at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., the institution that settles all stock trades in the U.S. He was speaking at a meeting of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's technology advisory committee on Oct. 3.

Such documents usually seek a range of information on various topics and fail to provide any substantial information on areas like cybersecurity, Rick Holland, chief information security officer at security firm Digital Shadows Ltd., said in an interview.

"They represent a snapshot in time and are primarily a box-checking exercise designed to reflect a modicum of due diligence," he said.

During the committee hearing, Mr. Harrell said that the documents can involve hundreds of questions, many allowing for only yes or no answers, which limits their utility.

Regulators have become increasingly focused on cybersecurity risk management. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission sent several questionnaires to investment advisers asking about "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-queries-investment-advisers-about-cloud-data-security-11559035802". The SEC in May "https://www.sec.gov/files/OCIE cautioning broker-dealers and investment advisers about the risks associated with storing customer records in the cloud.

The CFTC, meanwhile, "https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8008-19" Phillip Capital Inc. $1.5 million in September after hackers compromised the firm's email system and withdrew $1 million in client funds. Of the total, $1 million was earmarked for client restitution. The regulator's last cybersecurity-related fine was in February 2018, when it fined AMP Global Clearing LLC $100,000 for failing to properly supervise a third-party technology supplier.

Precisely what could either augment or replace the maligned questionnaire is unclear. Full audits of vendors are labor-intensive and expensive, Chris Morales, head of security analytics at software provider Vectra AI Inc., said in an interview. That means such an exercise generally makes sense for only critical suppliers.

Steve Durbin, managing director of the Information Security Forum, a nonprofit that advises organizations on cybersecurity issues, said that financial firms should move away from "outdated" processes like questionnaires. Instead, he said, they should focus on monitoring and protecting their networks and understanding how suppliers interact with them.

"The implications [of third-party breaches] are stark and the potential impacts very real," he said.

During the CFTC meeting, Mr. Harrell suggested that vendors could be forced to comply with a set of cybersecurity and resilience standards, needing certification showing they comply in order to provide services. Gary DeWaal, special counsel at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP and a member of the CFTC technology advisory committee, questioned who would issue those certifications.

"How can industry participants be satisfied that the accreditation, or certification, means anything?" he asked.

Mr. Harrell replied that financial firms and regulators would have to collaborate to figure that out and the industry recognizes that the system needs improvement.

"For the last 15 or 20 years, we've been using this questionnaire-based approach and maybe the threat landscape has changed enough now where that is no longer enough to provide reasonable assurance [about a vendor's cyber resilience]," he said.

Good day. Spotify did it last year. Slack did it this year. Airbnb is considering it. And now investors and entrepreneurs are debating the merits of it. Everyone is talking about them: direct listings, a potential avenue to a public listing that sidesteps some of the investment-bank guesswork of a traditional IPO.

But in their rush to embrace direct listings, some industry participants are overlooking the fact that there are other alternatives at their disposal. Google took one such route when it went public in 2004 by conducting a Dutch auction, where the stock price is determined by demand from bidders. Also, reverse mergers are occasionally undertaken by biotechnology companies, though few tech startups have tried that route. And special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have seen a few takers, like Social Capital, which created Hedosophia Holdings for this purpose.

Some also suggest there is room to modify the direct-listing approach. For example, raising capital before the listing would address one downside of direct listings in that they don't generate proceeds for the company. Alternately, building in a lock-up period for existing shareholders would prevent an exodus of existing shareholders during the crucial early trading period.

And now on to the news...

In the News

IPO record. Venture-backed companies going public so far this year have raised more money than in any full year on record, including during the dot-com boom, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports.

* These companies raised $23.3 billion in initial public offerings on U.S. exchanges in the first three quarters of the year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

* The previous record was in 2000, when companies raised $20.4 billion in the full year. Adjusted for inflation, the 2000 figure is equivalent to $30.3 billion in today's dollars.

* The record haul comes as some venture capitalists, including Benchmark's Bill Gurley, have been advocating for alternative methods of going public, such as through direct listings.

* The overall number of venture-backed IPOs so far this year, 61, is much lower than what was seen in the dot-com boom: 210 in 2000.

Insure-tech. Reinsurance company Munich Re AG has invested $250 million in Next Insurance Inc. in a funding round that valued the small-business insurance provider at more than $1 billion, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports. Munich Re was the sole investor in the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company's Series C round. Next Insurance offers general liability, professional liability, workers' compensation and other types of insurance policies for small businesses. The customers it serves "can be anything, from a clown to a general contractor."

Due diligence. San Francisco biotechnology investor Fifty Years is launching a new program to recruit more people with doctorate degrees or similar advanced scientific training into startups and venture capital, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports. The goal is both to help scientists translate their work into viable businesses and to ease tech investors into complex fields such as biopharmaceuticals and synthetic biology. "After Theranos, everyone is rightly worried that their fund name is going to appear on a cap table of a scientifically discredited company," Founding Partner Seth Bannon said.

Inside round. Lodging firm Oyo Hotels & Homes said it plans to raise $1.5 billion from its founder and existing investors, partly to fund its expansion in the U.S. and Europe. The Indian company counts SoftBank, Sequoia Capital, Airbnb Inc. and Lightspeed Venture Partners among its key investors.

Charges filed. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged six people with drug crimes who were allegedly linked to the overdose death of Colin Kroll, the co-founder of the HQ Trivia game app, the Journal's Corinne Ramey reports.

Spinoff. Walmart Inc. is talking to investors and companies about taking over its Jetblack personal shopping service in a potential spinoff that would have the unprofitable venture's CEO Jenny Fleiss exit, the Journal's Sarah Nassauer reports, citing people familiar with the matter. The retailer has engaged several potential partners including Microsoft Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., as well as venture-capital firms, including New Enterprise Associates, some of these people said.

Exits

CVC, a private-equity and credit investor with at least $82 billion in assets, confirmed that it agreed to acquire a minority stake in mobile marketing company IronSource for more than $400 million. Tel Aviv-based IronSource was founded in 2009 and offers technology that helps customers, particularly app developers, monetize and distribute their mobile apps, among other services. The company is expected to finish 2019 with $1 billion in revenue, according to a news release. It has been backed by Israeli venture-capital firm Viola Ventures, according to that firm's website.

VC Funds

Radian Capital has raised $300 million for its second flagship growth-equity fund, Radian Capital Partners II LP, a regulatory filing shows. Started by Jordan Bettman and Weston Gaddy, who came out of Bain Capital Ventures, the New York firm targets enterprise software companies and technology-enabled service providers. The firm raised its first fund with $150 million in commitments, double the amount it initially sought in 2016. Radian makes investments of between $5 million and $30 million.

Valor Ventures, an Atlanta-based venture-capital firm, raised more than a third of its $25 million target for its second fund. The new fund will invest in 25 to 30 seed-stage startups over four years, the firm said. It has made two investments to date: Capway, a digital banking and financial literacy platform, and Physican360, an on-demand prescription platform.

Tech News

Google weighs acquisition of rival to video app TikTok. Firework is the startup behind an app that lets users share 30-second clips; Weibo also has expressed interest.

PayPal drops out of Facebook's Libra payments network. Payments company's move comes as other financial partners reconsider their involvement.

Venture Firm 83North Raises $300 Million for New Fund; Former Greylock spinoff will target enterprise-data startups in Europe and Israel

Venture-capital firm 83North, which targets Europe and Israel, has raised a new $300 million fund.

The investment vehicle is 83North's fifth fund targeting consumer and technology companies.

83North has notched several notable exits, including that of European financial-technology startup iZettle, which PayPal Holdings Inc. bought for $2.2 billion last year; and food-delivery startup Just Eat PLC, which went public in 2014.

The new fund brings 83North's total capital under management to roughly $1.1 billion. The firm was rebranded as 83North in 2015 after it spun out from U.S.-based Greylock Partners, and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150106eb16ss1wj". 83North has offices in London and Israel and targets startups in enterprise software, data and cloud and financial technology.

The fund is particularly interested in technology applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to traditional processes in industries such as insurance, health, banking and manufacturing, Gil Goren, a partner at the firm, wrote in an email message.

"In turn, this phenomena will create new opportunities for startups to disrupt incumbents which are the current vendors of enterprise software in these legacy industries," Mr. Goren said.

In September, 83North led a $7.5 million Series A round into Lenses.io, a data-analysis startup. In July, 83North led a $150 million debt-and-equity deal into Lendbuzz Inc., a fintech startup focusing on auto financing.

In Europe, 25 venture funds raised $3.7 billion in the third quarter of 2019, according to according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro Venture Capital publisher Dow Jones & Co. In the third quarter of 2018, roughly 21 venture funds in Europe raised $3.2 billion.

Security takes centre stage in Israeli fintech boom

The country s mandatory military service churns out many highly trained engineers each year

From their offices atop a petrol station in Herzliya, hackers working for an Israeli company found their way into the secrets of a major European bank. They took screenshots of the bank s senior leadership, turned on the security staff s webcams, generated codes that made ATMs spew out cash, and eventually made a  ¬50m transfer that evaded the bank s internal security.

Mission completed, CYE, which has 70 employees, presented the results of the penetration test to the bank itself.

The bank had authorised the invasion, which demonstrated that there were security loopholes that needed to be closed. The penetration test, which CYE doesn t normally disclose but discussed with the bank s permission, led to a five-year contract for the artificial intelligence based cyber security company.

International contracts like this one are crucial for Israeli fintechs.

Israeli banks are, to be blunt, dull. Three major banks dominate the market, and a fear of global financial contagion has kept them well capitalised and risk averse. ( Blame Obama,  joked a bank clerk when your correspondent complained about how many days it takes to open an account, referring to US-sponsored anti-money laundering regulations.)

Israeli fintech, on the other hand, is blazing. By October this year, start-ups in the sector had already attracted $1.25bn in investments, up from $840m in the whole of last year, according to Start-Up Nation Central.

About 570 companies are jockeying for survival. And with a tiny, regulated market at home, they are mostly chasing the big money at global banks, and in some cases  like insurance company Lemonade  going it alone in hugely competitive markets such as the US and Europe.

CYE (which stands for Cyber-Eye) works with governments, insurers and Fortune 500 clients as well as banks. Chief executive Reuven Aronashvili says that his military background, which included years of identifying threats to the Israel Defense Forces, prepared him to locate threats to businesses and then figure out ways to defend them.

It is not surprising that a lot of Israeli firms focus on security, given how many highly trained engineers the country s mandatory military service churns out each year, says Yair Fonarov at Start-Up Nation Central, which works with companies and the Israeli government. But over time, adds Mr Fonarov, they have diversified.

About a quarter of Israel s fintech companies are trading and investing platforms, and a fifth are payments and money transfer companies according to Mr Fonarov.

The big success, measured by fundraising, is Lemonade, which has attracted just under $500m from investors by selling insurance directly to individual customers.

Crucially, given the small market in Israel, start-ups have to think big  filling the gaps in major international markets, rather than targeting the few million potential customers at home.

Payooneer is one example. It competes with companies such as TransferWise in the cross-border payments market, has raised $280m, and claims 4m customers around the world.

Fundbox is another. It speeds up payments between US businesses and their suppliers, has raised $430m, and drew interest from Jeff Bezos  personal investment vehicle.

There are also opportunities in Israel, despite its small size. The government is trying to shake up the oligopolies enjoyed by Israeli banks. Already, says Mr Fonarov, it has attracted research and development centres from Citi and Barclays, and on September 24it announced the first new bank licence in nearly 40 years  to a digital bank.

The entrepreneurs behind it are Marius Nacht, the co-founder of Checkpoint, Israel s largest cyber security firm, and Amnon Shashua, who helped turn automotive chipmaker Mobileye into the country s largest tech exit, for $15bn to Intel.

 In a concentrated market like this, this will open a lot of doors for start-ups to come and work with them,  says Mr Fonarov.

There are lots of fintechs out there what makes you special:Few financial services companies manage to drive engagement amongemployees, let alone meaningful behavioural change. Yulife uses tech, game theory and rewards to do just that.

Further fintech fascination

Follow the money:There have been some hefty funding rounds this week. US-based software group Unqork, whose clients include Goldman Sachs, John Hancock and Liberty Mutual, hasraised $80mto expand into new markets and hire new engineers. Meanwhile,TechCrunch reportsthat Next Insurance, an SME specialist, has become the latest insurtech unicorn, raising $250m from Munich Re to give it a valuation of over $1bn.

Stumbling blocks:The multitude of innovation labs set up by banks around the world have failed to produce much in the way of disruptive change, argues FT Alphaville s Izabella Kaminska.  The proposition seemed to be that innovation couldn t occur outside a hip co-working environment like a WeWork office, featuring as large a range of uncomfortable chairs as possible,  she says, concluding that innovation has moved  to the research and development departments of tech companies or the anonymous wastelands of the internet and in so doing, setting its sights on much bigger banking targets. 

New frontiers:Netherlands-based challenger bank Bunq is to move into the UK,reports Sifted, taking on the likes of N26, Monzo and Curve. The company, which has raised nothing at all from venture capital investors, has deposits of  ¬211m and already operates in 30 countries. The CEO saysthe fact that the UK already has so many challenger banks shows that people are ready for change.

Crypto chronicles:The UK s Financial Conduct Authority has 87 inquiries on its books into crypto companies, up 74 per cent over the past year, reports the Financial Times. The regulator says that consumers have lost at least 27m in crypto and foreign-exchange scams. Meanwhile, Facebook s efforts to get its Libra cryptocurrency off the ground suffered a setback when PayPal decided to pull out. PayPal said it wanted to focus on other priorities.

Your morning City briefing on companies in the news, job moves and what s happening in the markets

FT subscribers can click here to receive Opening quote by email.

HSBC: does it now stand for How Soon Before I m Canned? That might be what employees of the bank are thinking this Monday morning following news that the group has embarked on a cost-cutting drive that threatens up to 10,000 jobs.

The FT s banking editor reports that the plan is the lender s most ambitious attempt to rein in costs in years and would result in a substantial reduction in HSBC s headcount of roughly 238,000. Any job cuts implemented as part of the latest sweep would come on top of 4,700 redundancies that HSBC   which declined to comment   has recently announced.

Interim chief executive Noel Quinn, who has been told he is a leading internal candidate for the role, is looking to rein in costs and make his mark.  There s some very hard modelling going on,  a person briefed on the plans said.  We are asking why we have so many people in Europe when we ve got double-digit returns in parts of Asia. 

HSBC joins other banks shedding roles: Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Socit Gnrale and Citigroup have also announced hefty lay-offs this year.

Briefly

De La Rue has named a senior industrials executive as its new chief executive, as the banknote printer reorganises its business to deal with a series of setbacks including a Serious Fraud Office investigation. Clive Vacher has joined De La Rue with immediate effect, replacing Martin Sutherland who announced his departure in May following a profit warning.

Neil Woodford s stricken Equity Income fund has shrunk 20 per cent in the four months since it was suspended as more than a dozen holdings have tumbled in value. The fall means the UK s best known stockpicker has lost three-quarters of the assets he managed at the height of his business two years ago.

Sensyne Health, the medical artificial intelligence company that floated in London last year, has reported maiden annual results which show its operating loss for the year to April more than doubled to just over 19m. Neil Woodford was an investor in the group; it is unclear whether he continues to be so.

Kaspi.kz, a Kazakh fintech group, has postponed its London flotation, which was thought to have valued it at $5bn, citing  currently unfavourable and uncertain market conditions, particularly in the technology sector .

Building materials group SIG has issued a profit warning, saying it is  anticipating significantly lower underlying profitability for the full year than its previous expectations . The FTSE 250 company cited economic weakness, especially in the UK and Germany.

Job moves

Former Treasury official John Kingman is joining Tesco Bank as a non-executive director next month. It has been reported that Sir John, who was put in charge of rescuing the UK s banks during the financial crisis, is being lined up as the next chairman of the supermarket bank to replace Graham Pimlott.

We re looking to feature more job moves. If you re in senior management and moving jobs or you know someone who is, let us know about it at quote@ft.com

Beyond the Square Mile

Nissan s struggle to fill the leadership vacuum left by the arrest of Carlos Ghosn has led to a boardroom civil war, with powerful internal factions wrestling for control of the Japanese carmaker.

Facebook is being questioned by Brussels over potential financial risks posed by its Libra coin project as the EU prepares to overhaul regulation of digital currencies. PayPal   one of Libra s founding members   pulled out of the project last week.

Socit Gnrale s chief executive has become the latest European chief executive to wade into a fierce monetary policy debate, dismissing calls for the European Central Bank to buy bank bonds by arguing it would support failing rivals and prevent consolidation. Frdric Ouda told the FT the ECB should not try to reduce the cost of funding for  an average, mediocre, small retail bank .

Mikhail Fridman is facing questioning in Spain over allegations he illegally laid  economic siege  to an acquisition target while camouflaging his true role, according to court documents seen by the FT. The Russian billionaire strongly denies the allegations, maintaining he neither sought to acquire the company nor controlled companies the prosecutor claims have engaged in illegal conduct.

Closing quote   essential comment before you go

Andrew Hill

Organisations are misreading the way people respond to stress from new technology, our columnist argues, with a safety report following two fatal Boeing crashes highlighting a range of human factors companies should not ignore.

Patrick Jenkins

There is greater regulatory scrutiny on the $2tn-a-day spot foreign exchange market but the plain old consumer market for foreign currency is also ripe for a shake-up.

Facebook's digital currency plans are coming under more scrutiny, with the European Union wanting answers as to how the Libra project will handle counter-terrorismfinancing rules, money laundering and tax evasion.

A European Commissionquestionnaire sent to Facebook also seeks to understand how Libra would manage its reserves, protect customer data and addresswidespread use of the digital currency potentially creating threats to financial stability.

PayPal pulled out of Libra on Friday and a person told theFT itwas concerned Facebook had not done enough to address the regulatory backlash against the project, especially over money-laundering concerns.

On the theme of grappling with the impact of digital currencies and payments, new figures show Britain's Financial Conduct Authoritynow has 87 inquiries on its books into crypto companies, compared with 50 this time last year. The FCA estimates consumers have lost at least 27m in crypto and foreign-exchange scams. Alphaville has also been looking at a Libra rival in the shape of Sokin, a  global cross-border payments firm  launching in early 2020 that plans to charge users 9.99 a month.

Europelooks set to make Big Tech even more accountable, with Margrethe Vestagerhavingenhanced authority in her new five-year term as both a competition enforcer and digital policy supremo. Our Brussels bureaureports she is expected touseso-called   interim measures  for the first time in nearly two decadesto force chipmakerBroadcomto cease alleged anti-competitive practices,even before a full probe into its conduct ends.

The Internet of (Five) Things

1. Record industry cautious on Apple bundling

Apple seems out of tune with record company executives over its aspirations to bundle Apple Music with its new Apple TV+ Netflix rival, according to the FT's scoop.Executives fear that margins may be hurt if Apple undercuts the $10 monthly price that Spotify, Apple Music and others charge for a music service on its own.

2. Britain'sfintech banking race

The UK's  neobanks  are racing each other for leadership in the fintech sector. Retail banking correspondent Nicholas Megaw has been assessing the strengths and weaknesses of Atom, Monzo, Revolut, Starling and Tandem. Meanwhile,online wealth manager Nutmeg has revealed widening losses as it increased spending on staff and technology to attract new customers.

3. Another IPO pulled, Faangs for the memory

Kaspi.kz, a Kazakh fintech group, has postponed its London flotation, which was thought to have valued it at $5bn, citing  currently unfavourable and uncertain market conditions, particularly in the technology sector . In the US, the group of techstocks that helped propel the stock market to record highs in recent years   Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google   has become a drag on it.

4. Microsoft spots Iranhack attack on presidential campaign

Hackers linked to the Iranian government have targeted US government officials and at least one 2020 US presidential campaign, according to Microsoft. In a blog post, security executive Tom Burt said the Phosphorus hacking group made more than 2,700 attempts in September to identify the email accounts of Microsoft customers,includingan unnamed presidential campaign, current and former US government officials, and journalists covering global politics.

5. Our driverless duckiebot future

I was impressed with a look at our driverless futureat London's Science Museum recently, where duckiebots and Duckietown were featured   miniself-driving robots taking rubber ducks (below)round a model town to help design traffic control in an autonomous environment. Wired reports on a similar effort in the US, where model cars are zooming around circuits at universities and research centres up and down the country to boost progress on full-sized self-driving cars.

Tech week ahead

Another quiet few days on the calendar, before third-quarter tech earnings reports kick in next week.

On Tuesday, Samsung is expected to post a fourth consecutive quarter of declining profit when it reports preliminary earnings, though investors will be hoping the worst has passed, with chip prices showing signs of recovery.

There are two tech conferences to note: chip designer Arm's TechCon in San Jose from Tuesday to Thursday, and World Summit AI on the latest in artificial intelligence, held in the Netherlands on Wednesday and Thursday.

Tech tools   Kindle for kids

Anything that encourages childrento read more has to be a good thing, even though the Kindle Kids Edition hardware here is just a regular entry-level Kindle bundled with a choice of colourful covers. The software and services are interesting and innovative though. There are features like Achievement Badges, such as Book Worm and Over Achiever, when progress is made, and a one-year subscription to Freetime Unlimited is included. This can be used on other devices as well and gives access to thousands of kid-friendly books, movies, TV shows, educational apps, Audible books, and games. Kids Edition is available on October 30 for $110 (100).

Banks Expected to Get Regulatory Relief

By Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected this week to complete some of the most significant changes to bank rules since President Trump took office, setting up a new way of deciding which large banks are hit with its toughest regulations.

The Fed said last week that it would vote Thursday on a measure to ease liquidity and capital rules for the country's large banks, signing off on a plan that may lower regulatory costs for regional U.S. lenders under the $700 billion asset line.

Foreign banks with operations in the U.S. also are expected to win relief.

Under a proposal released a year ago, the Fed would divide large U.S. banks into four categories based on their size and other risk factors. Regional lenders would be either entirely free from certain capital and liquidity requirements or see those requirements reduced.

"All but the very biggest banks doing business in the United States will receive significant regulatory relief," said Karen Petrou, head of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory advisory firm. Ms. Petrou said it is impossible to forecast how much relief specific lenders will receive until the details of the final rules are given.

The Fed on Thursday also said it planned to ease requirements that large banks plan annually for their own demise, completing a measure on what are known as living wills that it formally floated in the spring.

The central bank in April proposed requiring the largest U.S. banks, including Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.,to produce living-will plans every four years rather than every year. Every two years banks would file pared-down versions of the plans, addressing capital and liquidity, core parts of their wind-down strategies and any major shifts in their operations.

While no one rule change so far has been monumental, the collective changes represent a significant step to soften the impact of the Dodd-Frank law, signed in 2010 to ward off another financial meltdown.

A law signed by President Trump in May 2018 eased restrictions for banks with less than $250 billion in assets, the impetus for a series of regulatory changes.

The plans have divided the Fed, with Trump-appointed regulators and an official nominated by President Obama taking opposite sides.

Supporters say the efforts would cut the regulatory burden while maintaining the most stringent requirements for firms that pose the greatest risks.

"We've been working on a regulatory restructuring that is aggressive in its scope but responsible in its substance," Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said this summer.

Fed governor Lael Brainard has dissented. The Obama appointee said the policy proposals under consideration "weaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system" and raise "the risk that American taxpayers again will be on the hook."

The Fed also has several unfinished items on its to-do list that other regulators have already completed. These include measures to ease compliance with the Volcker rule, which limits speculative trading with banks' own funds.

Inside View: An Investment Tip From Mr. ZIP

By Andy Kessler 
874 words
7 October 2019
The Wall Street Journal
J
A17

Here's an enduring lesson about investment. In the mid-1990s, well before streaming (2007) or Blu-ray (2003) or even DVRs (1999), I was convinced that every television would someday have an attachment to record and play back shows digitally. Digital videodiscs were available and personal computers had only expensive read-only drives. But I figured drives that also let users burn DVDs would soon take off, so my partner, Fred, and I started scouring Silicon Valley for technology that would benefit.

In the small city of Milpitas -- ZIP Code 95035 -- we stumbled upon a company named Elantec Semiconductor, which had gone public in 1995 at $7 a share. Cowen Inc. and Hambrecht & Quist were the underwriters, for those who remember those days. Don Valentine of Sequoia Capital and Apple Computer fame was the (pedigreed) chairman. It had $30 million or so in revenue but wasn't really growing. When Fred and I found it, the stock was broken, trading around $3. It had 10 million shares, so it was trading at a lowly one times sales.

We started visiting the company, meeting the CEO and CFO once a month. They told us they had developed a little $2 laser-diode driver that could allow a compact-disc drive to burn data onto a blank disc. Lights flashed in my mind when I heard this: Could their laser driver do the same thing for DVD drives? Someday, I was told, but it would be really expensive. Even so-called CD-R drives for PCs were still $500. Gut check -- time to move on? Nah.

We weren't discouraged. Everything that comes out of Silicon Valley starts out expensive, then sells like hot cakes as costs decline. We were long-term investors -- patience was our middle name. So we started buying stock at $3. It started ticking up: $3.13, $3.25, $3.50. We were geniuses! Then we got too busy to buy more shares for a few days and the stock slid back to $3. Turned out we were the ones driving up the thinly traded stock!

So we slowly kept buying shares and continued to visit the company for updates. Elantec's only competitor for laser-diode drivers was Toshiba, and because Toshiba also sold CD drives, every other Japanese CD company bought from Elantec.

Around the same time, music was becoming available online through MP3 downloads, which Napster had made easy. There wasn't anywhere to play these files except on your PC -- the iPod didn't come out until 2001. About 95% of PCs from Dell and Hewlett-Packard came with read-only CD drives standard. The "attach rate" of drives for recordable CDs was only 2% or 3%. Over six months, we kept buying the stock as it rose to $4, then fell to $3.50, until we owned close to 10% of the company. We had to file Schedule 13D ownership forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- a huge pain and needless legal expense. I wanted to sell at $6, but I asked Fred if he thought it could go to $10. He smiled and said, "At least." We could stay patient for years, but it didn't take that long.

A company named Roxio started selling software to write music to CDs so you could play downloaded music in a car or on a portable disc player. MP3 players started arriving. And the price of writable CD drives started dropping: $300, then $200 and then quickly piercing $99. In a flash, the attach rate for these drives went from 5% to 85%. Elantec's stock took off. Momentum investors in mutual funds clamored for it as their earnings took off. We sold our entire position in two afternoons in 1999 for between $175 and $200.

Believe me, I've had plenty of awful investments, including more than a few zeros. And I was wrong about what would make this stock work: There never was a market for rewritable DVD drives for TVs. DVRs with hard drives ended up filling that role. I was looking too far into the future. But the investment worked because we had the concept right, and we were in the right neighborhood when things took off. The simple lesson: You don't need to know the address if you're in the right ZIP Code.

The same strategy can help you navigate today's tech world. Think augmented reality will be everywhere? Three-dimensional printing? Drones? Great. Look up and down the supply chain until you find protected pieces of key technology. You don't have to be 100% right, only close. Maybe those will be keys for other markets as well. How about smart cities? Facial payments? Gene therapy? Think machine learning is the future of computing? Fine, start finding all the new chips and architectures needed. Will it affect retail? Design? Communicating with animals?

The future is always fuzzy. Like horseshoes and hand grenades, you only have to be close. Get in the ZIP Code where the wind's blowing, and watch things fly.

An ETF That Stays on Brand; Brand Value ETF aims to identify companies with a strong brand value that isn't recognized in their share price

For investors, brand power is an undervalued asset.

That's the thinking behind Brand Value ETF (BVAL), a $15.2 million exchange-traded fund that launched in June 2017 and has returned almost 20% this year through September. The fund tracks Brandometry's EQM Brand Value Index, which aims to identify companies with a strong brand value that isn't recognized in their share price. It assigns a brand-power score based on metrics like familiarity, favorability, investment potential, perception of management, and brand reputation. This score stems from analysis conducted by the Corebrand Analytics tool from Tenet Partners, a consulting firm focused on brand strategy and research.

The index comprises the 50 companies with the highest brand-power score to market-capitalization ratio.

Typically the financial-services industry doesn't track intangibles like brand value because it doesn't usually show up on a balance sheet, says Larry A. Medin, Brandometry's founder and CEO.

"We felt that if we could have a way of measuring the strength of a company's brand, we could identify companies that are currently undervalued," he says, describing this as a "regression to the mean" type approach, with the idea being that a strong brand is likely to boost a company's share price over time.

Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar Inc., questions the approach, saying there are numerous examples of companies whose strong brands failed to prevent a downturn in their business.

"Brand value is impossible to measure with precision and is awfully fragile," he says.

For his part, Mr. Medin says there is rarely a major shift in brand power "unless there has been some major disruption." And he says BVAL's approach compensates for such shifts, with the fund's index committee potentially removing a company, especially if it has some ingrained issue such as fraud.

Axa chief braced for Big Tech threat

Insurance

The chief executive of France's Axa believes that the insurance industry's "competitors of tomorrow" will be the big data-driven tech companies such as Facebook.

"If your endgame is to be an orchestrator of a community of the insured, with the aim of helping each other and leveraging the collective wisdom, which is the business model that you see in today's market that is closest to that?" asked Thomas Buberl, who has run Axa, the second-largest insurer by assets, since 2016.

The answer is "Facebook, Google, or Apple ... I believe those are our competitors of tomorrow, and not Lemonade or other small insurance companies," he said, referring to the largest of the "insurtech" start-ups, which was valued at a reported $2bn in its latest funding round.

Under Mr Buberl, Axa acquired the Bermuda-listed insurer XL in March last year, and then listed Axa Equitable, the group's US life insurance company, shifting the company's portfolio from market-dependant life and investment products to underwriting-dependent property casualty and health products. The way to win in the latter businesses was to provide services to customers that helped them reduce risk, rather than simply paying claims when risks bit, Mr Buberl said.

"My conviction is that in the long term, an insurance company will not be [primarily] a claims payment company any more."

Tech groups are creeping into insurance: Tesla announced last month that it would begin selling insurance directly to Tesla drivers, underwritten by its partner Markel, and said it had plans to become a fully fledged insurer in time.

"You don't have a classic case of a car any more," Mr Buberl said, but "a rolling tech stack" that provided a wealth of information about future maintenance costs and risk. Using data gathered from customers to help those same customers cut risk would be at the heart of the insurance businesses in the future, Mr Buberl argued.

Sector insiders agree that the data amassed by big tech has competitive implications. "The life insurance industry is a capital-intensive, long-term-oriented business" that tech companies might hesitate to enter, said Joel Albarella, who runs New York Life Ventures, the venture capital arm of New York Life. "That said, better tech will theoretically originate better risk assets," he said, arguing that the Tesla case showed the potential in property and casualty.

Axa's strategy for dealing with competition from big-tech companies is to become their partner of choice. "I don't think [big tech] will always go into the business [directly]," Mr Buberl said. "The question is, who partners with whom? Facebook and Google will probably only have one partner ... and these partners [will] need to be global because those companies do not want to talk to 163 different insurers."

He cited Axa's partnership with Uber the insurer provides disability and maternity/paternity protection for drivers as a step in that direction. See Markets

Good day. Three venture-backed biotechnology companies went public Thursday, showing mixed results. One of them, Frequency Therapeutics Inc., dropped in its first day of trading, while the other two, Aprea Therapeutics Inc. and Viela Bio Inc. jumped. The offerings followed the decision by a fourth biotech company, ADC Therapeutics SA, to withdraw its IPO the day before it was scheduled to go out.

Meanwhile, shared-elector scooter startup Bird Rides Inc. made the next move in the scooter wars, raising $275 million.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Scooter cash. Shared-electric-scooter startup Bird Rides Inc. raised a $275 million Series D funding round, tapping a Canadian pension fund and existing investor Sequoia Capital, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports.

* Montreal's Caisse de dpt et placement du Qubec is the newest investor in Bird, and is a departure from the traditional venture firms that led Bird's previous financing rounds.

* The Santa Monica, Calif.-based startup said the fund's investment was a reflection of the shift in Bird's focus to turning a profit.

Biotech IPOs. Frequency Therapeutics Inc., whose first medicine could treat the most common type of hearing loss, priced its initial public offering at $14 a share and slid 2.1% to close the day at $13.70. Oncology-focused Aprea Therapeutics Inc. debuted at $15 and jumped more than 36.6% to finish at $20.50, while Viela Bio Inc., an autoimmune-disease drug company, went out at $19 and climbed 23.2% to close at $23.41. Another biotech that had planned to go public in the U.S. this week, Swiss cancer-drug developer ADC Therapeutics SA, previously withdrew its registration.

Ad-tech deal. Digital-advertising rivals Taboola and Outbrain have agreed to merge. The companies, which place advertising on publishers' websites, will join forces and operate under the Taboola name. Outbrain said its shareholders will receive the stock equivalent to 30% of the combined firm and $250 million in cash. Before the merger, Taboola had raised at least $157 million from investors including Fidelity Investments, Marker Financial Advisors and Steadfast Capital. Outbrain had raised at least $150 million from backers including Index Ventures, Viola Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Gemini Israel Ventures, Susquehanna Growth Equity and HarbourVest.

Juul write-down. Hedge fund Darsana Capital Partners recently wrote down its investment in Juul Labs Inc. by more than a third and now holds it at a price that values the e-cigarette company at $24 billion, the Journal's Juliet Chung reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Media merger. Vice Media LLC's deal to acquire female-focused digital media company Refinery29 was a mixture of cash and stock and valued Refinery29 at at least $400 million, the Journal's Kimberly Chin reports, citing people familiar with the matter.

Grab fine. Malaysia's competition watchdog has proposed a fine of $20.5 million on ride-hailing company Grab for breaching the country's competition law.

Biotech slump. Investment in the U.K.'s biotechnology sector in the year to date has slumped, according to data published by an industry group Thursday. Venture-capital funding more than halved to 458 million when compared with the same period in 2018.

From Twitter to VC

Former Twitter chief Dick Costolo led the social-media company through its transition from startup to public company and now is a venture investor. Mr. Costolo joined WSJ Pro Venture Capital to discuss what it takes to make that switch.

Q:

On being a public company CEO vs. a VC:

A:

When you're running a company with as much going on as Twitter, it's really all you think about. You wake up at 3 a.m., it's what you're thinking about. It's constant. You really kind of develop tunnel vision about your company. [But as a VC] you learn a ton. You get to see all sorts of things you weren't thinking about before. There's introverted CEOs who are amazing. It's fun to see all the different ways there are to be successful.

Q:

On why he won't be giving entrepreneurs unsolicited advice as a VC:

A:

Maybe one of the things from being a CEO and moving over to the investment side, is [you learn that] the people running the company have a lot more context going on. You probably don't need to give them advice until you know a lot more.

Lazard Asset Management, the New York-based fund house with assets of $214bn, has axed more than 60 staff as it withdraws from a range of subscale funds that have failed to win investor support.

The cuts, which represent 7 per cent of the more than 850-strong workforce, followed an internal review led by Ashish Bhutani, chief executive of LAM, according to two people close to the situation.

As a pure play active manager, Lazard and its midsized peers have suffered investor flight from higher cost active management to lower cost passive funds.

Rising costs and lower fee revenue more generally have led to a shake-out at investment companies with Black-Rock, Axa Investment Managers, Jupiter, GAM and AQR among those that have cut jobs this year.

More than three-quarters of LAM's assets are in equities with fixed income, convertibles, real assets and alternatives making up most of the rest.

It has also been building up its quantitative equity business, which has $16bn of assets.

Mr Bhutani is also increasing the unit's focus on technology; investment tied to environmental, social and governance criteria; artificial intelligence and data scientists; and enhanced distribution in partnership with its sister operation in Europe.

Jennifer Anderson and Nikita Singhal joined the firm as co-heads of sustainable investment and ESG this year while Shaunak Khire and Trevor Mottl joined its alternative investment platform.

Investment in new areas will see headcount at about 790 by the end of the year, roughly equivalent to its level at the start of 2018. LAM told those staff affected by the cuts last week.

The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Fed Expected to Give Large Banks a Break on Postcrisis Rules; Central bank prepares to vote on some of the most significant changes since Trump took office

WASHINGTON The Federal Reserve is expected next week to complete some of the most significant changes to bank rules since President Trump took office, setting up a new way of deciding which large banks are hit with its toughest regulations.

The Fed "https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20191010open.htm" it would vote Oct. 10 on a measure to ease liquidity and capital rules for large U.S. banks, signing off on a plan that may lower regulatory costs for regional U.S. lenders under the $700 billion asset line. Foreign banks with operations in the U.S. are also expected to win relief.

Under a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-set-to-propose-looser-rules-for-large-u-s-banks-1540995057", the Fed would divide large U.S. banks into four categories based on their size and other risk factors. Regional lenders would be either entirely free from certain capital and liquidity requirements or see those requirements reduced.

"All but the very biggest banks doing business in the United States will receive significant regulatory relief," said Karen Petrou, head of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory advisory firm. She said it is impossible to forecast how much relief specific lenders will receive until the details of the final rules are given.

The Fed on Thursday also said it planned to ease requirements that large banks plan annually for their own demise, completing a measure on what are known as living wills that it formally floated this spring.

The central bank in April proposed requiring the largest U.S. banks, including Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-expected-to-ease-living-wills-allowing-large-banks-to-file-wind-down-plans-less-frequently-11554731689" rather than every year. Every two years banks would file pared-down versions of the plans, addressing capital and liquidity, core parts of their wind-down strategies and any major shifts in their operations.

While no one rule change thus far has been monumental, the collective changes represent a significant step to soften the impact of the Dodd-Frank law, signed in 2010 to ward off another meltdown.

A law signed by Mr. Trump in May 2018 "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-will-banks-do-with-cash-freed-up-by-rule-changes-no-one-knows-1541156404"the impetus for a series of regulatory changes.

The plans have divided the Fed, with Trump-appointed regulators and an official nominated by President Obama taking opposite sides.

How will the expected rollback of some of these bank rules affect you or your business? Join the conversation below.

Supporters say the efforts would cut the regulatory burden while maintaining the most stringent requirements for firms that pose the greatest risks. "We've been working on a regulatory restructuring that is aggressive in its scope but responsible in its substance," Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles said this summer.

Fed governor Lael Brainard has dissented. The Obama appointee said the policy proposals under consideration "weaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system" and raise "the risk that American taxpayers again will be on the hook."

The Fed also has several unfinished items on its to-do list that other regulators have already completed. These include measures to ease compliance with the Volcker rule, which limits speculative trading with banks' own funds.

Banking & Finance: Lazard To Cut Jobs in Asset Unit

Lazard Ltd. is cutting up to 7% of its employees in its asset-management division and closing some investment funds by year's end, people familiar with the matter said, amid a tougher climate for money managers.

Lazard Asset Management, which employs over 850 people and oversees $213.6 billion in assets, told staffers of the cuts last week, one of the people said.

The reduction of up to 60 jobs, along with the decisions to shutter some investment strategies, follow a review of the business.

While Lazard takes a look at the business's direction annually, this year's review ended with the firm making steeper cuts than usual. Lazard is culling funds in several regions and across multiple asset classes.

The cuts come as the asset-management industry contends with sweeping changes. The shift of trillions of dollars into low-cost funds that track popular indexes has pressured many managers to slash fees and exit from strategies that have struggled to gain traction. Those firms have in turn ramped up spending on businesses and technology that will help them stand out in a market many executives believe is poised for a shakeout.

In recent years, Lazard has expanded its offerings in the more promising parts of its business, including sustainable and quantitative investing, value stocks and artificial intelligence.

Good day! This week barely got started before the nemesis of the private-equity industry was at it again. As WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming reports, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts went after the industry over investments in companies that seek to profit from providing services to prisons. It's tempting to ask how her assaults on private equity square with the economic engines that drive the Bay State, including the big private-equity firms at the core of Boston's financial community. But then, she hails from Cambridge, and came out of Harvard Law School neither of which is known locally as friends and admirers of high finance.

Far to the southwest, WSJ Pro's Luis Garcia and Alexander Gladstone have an exclusive report on private equity-backed American Energy-Permian Basin LLC in Houston dodging a bankruptcy bullet by convincing most bondholders to accept a debt swap involving about $2 billion in obligations. Finally, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports that long-term health investor Strand Equity is joining actress Cameron Diaz in backing Modern Acupuncture as it seeks to expand its franchise, which already has locations in 16 states. And she gives us a look at snack maker Popcornopolis's new investors.

In other words, plenty to dig into today. Please read on...

Today's Top Stories

Warren Targets Prison-Services Plays as Debate Moves to Congress

The debate over private-equity investments in prison companies has moved from state pension offices to Capitol Hill. On Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) and Mark Pocan (D., Wis.) sent letters to five private-equity firms they say invest in prison-services providers, expressing concern about the role private equity plays in the sector. The lawmakers demanded answers from American Securities, Apax Partners, BlueMountain Capital Management, H.I.G. Capital and Platinum Equity regarding whether their portfolio companies are degrading the quality of the services they provide or are raising prices to extract greater profits.

American Energy-Permian Clinches Out-of-Court Debt Restructuring

Private equity-backed American Energy-Permian Basin LLC rounded up enough support from creditors to restructure about $2 billion in debt without resorting to bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter. The Houston-based energy producer, backed by private-equity firms OnyxPoint Global Management and Energy & Minerals Group, has struggled with slumping commodity prices that left it unable to support its debts. Founded in 2014 by the late wildcatting pioneer Aubrey McClendon, American Energy-Permian missed an interest payment in May and then began a debt-swap campaign, looking for participation from creditors holding at least 95% of each bond it had issued.

Strand Equity Joins Cameron Diaz in Backing Modern Acupuncture

Strand Equity is joining actress Cameron Diaz in backing Modern Acupuncture, a franchiser of clinics that use the ancient therapeutic technique. The Los Angeles firm is making a minority investment in Modern Acupuncture alongside a number of individuals identified by the company as including physician Dr. Charles Anderson, entrepreneur Cole Zucker and Ms. Diaz. The capital represents Modern Acupuncture's first outside equity investment and is expected to finance expansion.

Cohen's Cohen Private Ventures, according to a Warburg Pincus spokeswoman.

Industry News

Investors in publicly traded equities have had their confidence in U.S. growth tested by two straight days of market declines as fresh data on American manufacturers intensified concerns about a potential economic downturn. Despite a plethora of worrying developments this year a U.S.-China trade war, uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's interest-rate path, and slumping corporate earnings U.S. investors had bet consistently on continuing economic growth, even as markets overseas faltered. But Tuesday's new factory data has upended that strategy, for now.

Large technology companies are buying enterprise-software makers in record numbers, even as prices continue to climb. Most buyers are shrugging off higher valuations for these companies and striking deals for a chance to capitalize on a booming market for business software, industry analysts say.

Malaysia's competition watchdog has proposed a fine of $20.5 million on ride-hailing company Grab for breaching the country's competition law. Grab counts Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Group Corp. as investors.

Chinese venture capital investment into the US has fallen this year to its lowest level since 2015 as heightened US scrutiny over national security intensifies decoupling between the world's two largest economies.

But as Chinese funds fight shy of the US, they are turning their energies to Asia. India and south-east Asia are a particular focus, with Chinese venture capital investment in India surpassing that in the US in the latest quarter, according to data from Refinitiv.

"The critical technology areas are directly impacted," said Scott Kupor, managing partner at US venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, referring to the growing influence of Washington's national security concerns over the investment environment.

"It's definitely an impediment to anybody being really serious about taking Chinese money right now in the start-up community," he said.

Chinese funds invested just $4bn in US companies in the first nine months of 2019. That is the smallest amount since 2015, down from nearly $7bn in the same timeframe last year and $9bn in 2017, according to Refinitiv. Overall foreign investment in US venture capital was $51bn in the first nine months of 2019, Refinitiv said.

That pullback matches a broader drying up of Chinese foreign direct investment into the US. Chinese FDI a category that does not include venture capital fell to $5.4bn in 2018 from $29bn in 2017, according to Rhodium Group.

Refinitiv data showed the venture capital downdraught intensified in the latest quarter, with only $813m in venture capital inflows from Chinese funds recorded a 70 per cent drop from the same quarter last year.

One of the main deterrents, according to analysts, was scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), which reviews transactions involving foreign investors that may pose a security risk. Cfius intensified its scrutiny last year, implementing a programme to inspect minority investments in US companies making "critical technology" such as military equipment, semiconductors and "dual use" technology that could have both civilian and military applications.

Oversight of investment in US tech companies is particularly strong in areas such as artificial intelligence and software, where "dual use" is regarded as a potential risk.

"This day and age, it's hard to imagine a lot of companies that don't employ some form of artificial intelligence in their software development," said Mr Kupor, who testified before the US Senate last year on Cfius reforms.

Roger Robinson, president and chief executive of RWR Advisory Group, a risk consultancy in Washington, said Chinese groups were shunning investments and acquisitions in the US to avoid "embarrassing Cfius turn-downs".

"Certainly start-ups recognise that taking Chinese investment capital could prove the kiss of death to their acceptance as defence contractors, or even government procurement more broadly," he said.

New York-based fund house pulls back from a range of subscale funds

Lazard Asset Management, the New York-based fund house with assets of $214bn, has axed more than 60 staff as it withdraws from a range of subscale funds that have failed to win investor support.

The cuts, which represent 7 per cent of the more than 850-strong workforce, follow an internal review led by Ashish Bhutani, chief executive of LAM, said two people close to the situation.

As a pure-play active manager, Lazard and its midsized peers have suffered investor flight from higher-cost active management to lower-cost passive funds.

Rising costs and lower fee revenue more generally have led to a shake-out at investment companies, with BlackRock, Axa Investment Managers, Jupiter, GAM and AQR among those that have cut jobs this year.

More than three-quarters of LAM s assets are in equities, with fixed income, convertibles, real assets and alternatives making up most of the rest. It has also been building up its quantitative equity business which has $16bn of assets.

Mr Bhutani is also increasing the unit s focus on technology; investment tied to environmental, social and governance criteria; artificial intelligence and data scientists; and enhanced distribution in partnership with its sister operation in Europe.

Jennifer Anderson and Nikita Singhal joined the firm as co-heads of sustainable investment and ESG (environmental, social and governance) this year, while the group has stepped up its data science capabilities after hiring Shaunak Khire and Trevor Mottl to its alternative investment platform.

Investment in new areas will see headcount at about 790 by the end of the year, roughly equivalent to its level at the start of 2018.

LAM, which operates in 16 countries and is part of NYSE-listed Lazard Ltd, told those staff affected by the cuts last week. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Good day. Security chiefs should sharpen their presentation skills because they likely will have to ask the C-suite and board members for budget increases soon. Attacks launched by artificial intelligence could increase the cost of repairing a data breach in the future. The costs of covering fines and other legal action will also rise, experts predict.

Don't miss: Facebook scrambles to keep Libra on track; manufacturer in Denmark says attack cost it $95 million; and schools remain ransomware targets.

AI, Privacy Laws to Drive Data-Breach Costs Higher

Influence of advanced technology, better safeguards will make incidents pricier for companies

By James Rundle and Adam Janofsky

Data breaches can have some scary numbers attached to them, particularly when they involve personal information. Experts say that a confluence of privacy laws, developments in technology and more frequent attacks make future costs even more sobering.

Authorities in Europe have levied fines totaling hundreds of millions of dollars related to breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation. More than a dozen U.S. states are debating or enacting their own privacy laws that would punish companies that expose residents' data.

The effects of a breach could be made worse through artificial intelligence, experts say. The sophistication of chatbots and phishing schemes using natural-language processing could, for example, trick employees into clicking on infected links.

"We often think of technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things as tools for good, but attackers are starting to use them as well," said Kelvin Coleman, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, a nonprofit that facilitates public-private partnerships. Members include Intel Corp., American Express Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.

Direct assaults on systems could also be more dangerous when conducted by AI algorithms designed to find vulnerabilities, said Michael Sherwood, director of information technology for Las Vegas. He said he is concerned about the potential for "weaponized AI."

"That's where people are using the same types of technologies that defend our network to create their own hacking AIs, or threat AIs, and really posing a serious danger to our ability to keep the integrity of our networks intact," he said.

Certain types of information attract more sophisticated attackers. The board of clinical-data startup Verana Health Inc., for instance, is concerned that the value of the company's data makes it a prime target, said Jung Kim, chief security and compliance officer. Verana collects ophthalmology and neurology data.

"China, Russia we're attracting attention from them because of medical records. People pay more money for them than anything else," he said, referring to sales of such data on the dark web.

Consulting firm Accenture PLC predicts that the cost of data breaches world-wide from 2019 to 2024 could total $5.5 trillion.

The costs of fixing breaches and covering fines and other legal action will also rise, Mr. Coleman said. Spending often includes investing in new technologies, backing up networks and hiring and training staff.

Although a significant portion of costs are incurred in the first year after an incident, International Business Machines Corp. and the Ponemon Institute estimated in a 2019 report that around one-third of costs are incurred more than a year after an initial breach.

Industry and geography can play a role. While IBM estimates the average cost of a breach in the U.S. is $8.19 million, the global average is $3.92 million. These costs have also increased sharply the average U.S. data breach cost $3.54 million in 2006, IBM said.

Visa, Mastercard, others reconsider involvement in Facebook's Libra network. Wary of attracting regulatory scrutiny, executives of some backers of the cryptocurrency have declined Facebook's requests to publicly support the project, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter. Government officials and central bankers were quick to criticize the project, which Facebook announced in June. The officials cited concerns about how the network would protect users' privacy and prevent criminals from using it to launder money.

Compliance questions: Privately, U.S. regulators have leaned on Libra's backers. The Treasury Department sent letters to companies including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe Inc. asking for a complete overview of their money-laundering compliance programs and how Libra will fit into them, people familiar with the matter said.

$10 million ante: It is unclear how many of the initial Libra Association members ultimately will commit to the network. So far, members have signed nonbinding letters of intent, and they haven't yet handed over the $10 million that Facebook requested from each member to fund the creation of the coin and build out the network, the Journal's sources said.

Breach costs Danish manufacturer $95 million. A cyberattack at Demant AS, a hearing-aid maker in Copenhagen, disrupted operations and prompted the company to shut down technology systems, ZDNet reports. Demant, which makes Oticon and other popular hearing devices, said in a statement that costs from the Sept. 3 incident include estimated lost sales.

Demant said: "The incident has prevented us from executing our ambitious growth activities in some of the most important months of the year particularly in the US, which is our biggest market." The company continues to restore IT and business systems.

Hackers hit 500 schools in 2019 so far. Ransomware infections have hit school districts and colleges representing more than 500 schools in the first few months of 2019, according to a report from vendor Armor Defense Inc. The highest ransom demand so far has been $1.6 million, ZDNet reports.

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams discussed the U.S. central bank's inflation target, the effects of tariffs and trade uncertainty, the Fed's response to recent volatility in short-term interest rates, and moving away from the London interbank offered rate, during a moderated question-and-answer session at the University of California San Diego on Wednesday, Oct. 2. UC San Diego economics professor James Hamilton served as moderator. Here is a transcript, lightly edited for clarity and length.

JAMES HAMILTON: So if we just jump right in, John, the primary goals of the Federal Reserve are price stability and promoting maximum employment. So maybe we could talk a little bit about your perspectives on each of those, starting with price stability.

The Federal Reserve interprets price stability to mean 2 percent inflation. And one of the questions people ask me all the time is, why 2 percent inflation? Why not 1 percent inflation? Why not zero percent inflation?

MR. WILLIAMS: Right. And this is a question that actually has been studied a lot in the Fed and among economists, and really the issue much of my career was inflation   going back to the '90s and even early 2000s   was inflation had been   had been very high in the '70s and '80s and the Fed wanted inflation to be lower   lower than 10 percent, lower than 8, lower than 4.

And then in the '90s and on there was a discussion: What's the right level of inflation, consistent with both of our goals of price stability and maximum employment? And there was a couple issues that played into that.

One is measurement issues. A lot of research done by economists has pointed out that inflation measures tend to overstate inflation somewhat, that just the way they're constructed they probably don't have the newest goods and services in there, and so you have a little bit of what we call inflation bias. So, you know, an inflation rate that's above zero is probably actually zero.

The second is this issue of the limits of monetary policy. We have this maximum employment mandate, so that we want to be able to respond to events to keep the economy strong and growing, keep employment very strong. And in order to do that, during a downturn we need to lower interest rates and stimulate the economy. And when you have a very low inflation rate, that means that interest rates tend to be very low, and that means there's less room for monetary policy to cut interest rates and get the economy back on track. And so this is often referred to as the lower bound or zero lower bound issue, that you know, you want some buffer of interest rates so that you can respond to events.

The third issue that comes up is the experience of deflation. We know from the Great Depression and other era   you know, other examples that when you get prices falling over time that can create challenges for the economy and, again, interfere with this maximum employment goal.

And so we don't want high inflation because that's, obviously, not price stability. We know that high inflation is costly to the economy. It hurts lower-income households even more than everyone else. So we don't want inflation too high. We know that if inflation is too low, well, first there's this measurement issue of getting that right, but also that may limit our ability to really achieve our maximum employment and strong growth goals.

And so it's really a Goldilocks argument. Four percent or some higher number, obviously, was too high. We weren't happy with that. Inflation getting closer to zero is too low. And this 2 percent seemed to be a pretty good place to be.

So there was a lot of discussion and analysis of that. In January 2012 the [Federal Open Market Committee] for the first time actually articulated this 2 percent longer-term inflation goal, and we've   every year we have announced that, you know, we're continuing with that 2 percent inflation goal.

I will say that most central banks among advanced economies   in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere   have also   for I think similar considerations have come to 2 percent or maybe a little higher as a   as a good   a good, you know, place to be in terms of these various considerations. So, you know, it's not just the U.S. kind of saying let's choose a number; we've seen similar analysis and conclusions around the world.

MR. HAMILTON: OK. So 2 percent is the goal. For the last 10 years the inflation rate in the U.S. as measured by the implicit price deflator on personal consumption expenditures has averaged 1  percent, significantly under the 2 percent goal. So what factors have contributed to missing the goal for now 10 years?

MR. WILLIAMS: This is exactly the problem with having a goal that's so explicit   (laughter)   or maybe one of the benefits of having that. It is a benchmark that we do hold ourselves to and, you know, the public should as well.

And so it is true that we've   over the past decade have underrun the 2 percent goal, actually not just on average but in almost every year. Last year we saw   in 2018 we saw the   our preferred inflation measure get right up 2 percent, but it didn't stay there long and came back down.

So I think two factors, I think, are important. One is we did have the worst recession   not only in the United States, but a global recession   hopefully of our lifetimes during that period. So when the economy is weak, we see   not only in the U.S. but around the world we saw downward pressure on wages, high unemployment, downward pressure on wages and prices, and we saw inflation move down not only in the United States but, again, around the world.

The U.S. economy has grown   done better in terms of the recovery and the expansion. You know, we are now in the longest expansion in the U.S. since data were first kind of constructed, going back to the 1850s. But the rest of the world has not kept pace, and we've seen some upward pressure on the dollar, lower import prices. So this is another factor, I think, that's influenced lower   kind of lower inflation over the last few years.

That said, the commitment of the Federal Open Market Committee, me and my colleagues, is that want to see inflation at 2 percent and we view this as a symmetric goal. And the way I think of symmetry is, looking ahead, is we would expect inflation on average to be around 2 percent. About half of the time it would be above 2 percent a bit because just the variation in economic data, half the time below. So the last 10 years, I think, were unusual because of the events of the   of the global financial crisis and the ensuing   and other crises that led to global recessions have pulled down inflation Looking ahead, you know, the goal really is to have 2 percent on average and keep   you know, hitting this 2 percent most of the time in a symmetric way.

MR. HAMILTON: Well, moving on to the second goal, maximum employment, what do you see as the biggest concerns or risk factors for U.S. output and employment right now?

MR. WILLIAMS: Well, you know, it's interesting. It's a   it is a bit of a tale of   I guess if you're driving a car we often use this analogy of the rearview mirror versus the front windshield. So it is a bit of a contrast there. If you just look at where the U.S. economy is, unemployment's 3.7 percent. That's near the lowest we've seen in 50 years and below almost all estimates of what a strong economy would imply for the unemployment rate. We've added an enormous number of jobs. It's the longest expansion in history. [Gross domestic product] growth has been above most estimates of trend growth through the first half of this year. So if you   if you just look in the rearview mirror or you just take a snapshot of where the U.S. economy is, it's very strong. The labor market's strong. Growth has been very good. Consumer spending is strong. Financial conditions are supportive of all of that.

So the real issue is, where are things going from here? And that's where it's a much more mixed picture. Global growth, meaning outside the U.S., has slowed considerably in China, in Europe, and elsewhere. We've seen the effects of the trade tensions lead to   and other geopolitical tensions lead to higher uncertainty about the future, and that seems to have contributed to a pullback in business investment in the U.S. and abroad. And we're seeing a pullback in international trade, as well.

So there's   you know, again, if we're looking at where we are today, things I think are at a very favorable place. Looking ahead, there are a number of crosscurrents, if you will, that are leading to slower U.S. growth, hopefully around our trend growth rate, and still a stable labor market, which is what we want. But I think there are definitely a lot of uncertainties and risks out there that we're   we need to be navigating and I think, you know, we are navigating.

MR. HAMILTON: So in terms of the trade tensions, the U.S. tariffs mean higher prices for U.S. consumers. And as other countries retaliate, as they have been, it means   it's hitting U.S. exports. So this is a kind of development that raises both inflation and raises unemployment. Does the   how does that kind of event fit into the Fed's model of things you can respond to? How do you respond to that?

MR. WILLIAMS: Well, I think you've captured exactly the way I would describe it. These are factors influencing both the supply and the demand sides of the economy. They influence inflation, and we   we've done a lot of research on that. It's clear that the tariffs are being passed on to producer and consumer prices in the U.S. They, obviously, affect trade flows around the world, and so we're seeing those effects.

So I'd separate out two pieces. One is the direct effect of the actual tariffs on inflation and on output. Those, I think, we've got a lot of models, we've got a lot of analysis, and we can come up with reasonable estimates of those effects. And they're important, but they're still relatively modest.

The one that's hard is this uncertainty issue. There's been a lot of really good research going on about how uncertainty affects investment and employment, whether it's political uncertainty, economic uncertainty, and trade uncertainty is one of those. And that's one that is a bit newer in terms of our experience. We have a lot of models that we use to analyze how different changes in the economic environment affect the economic outlook, but trade uncertainty we don't have as much experience with and don't have as good estimates of those effects. So a lot of that is really gathering as much information as we can about what's happening in terms of wages and prices, what's happening in terms of, you know, investment and trade and economy, and basically trying to gather all that information and synthesize it into the outlook.

So the way I would put it is we think about this as how are these factors affecting the medium-term outlook for the economy, which I   you know, some of these are definitely reducing growth. And then thinking about the medium-term outlook for inflation, which is a modest increase in inflation.

So the uncertainty one is harder to know for two reasons. One is we don't have as much, you know, kind of experience with this. The other is it seems to change a lot. From one week to another, the headlines of the news around these issues are evolving.

I'll give you one data point that I find really informative, and that is Brexit. And if you look at the U.K., since Brexit in   over the last three years, business investment has basically flatlined or declined. You can see the effects of uncertainty about the political future   the economic, you know, future and political future of the U.K. with respect to the European Union is clearly having huge effects on business investment there and business confidence, and that's also spilling over into Europe. So, again, it's not just about, you know, the trade issues with   in terms of the U.S. and other countries; it's actually we're seeing this play out in a very big way around Brexit.

MR. HAMILTON: Now, among the concerns you've mentioned I didn't hear anything about the yield curve, something I'm reading a lot about, that the current interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond is below that on a one-year Treasury, an inversion of the yield curve. What's your perspective on what that   what that tells us?

MR. WILLIAMS: Well, there's been a lot of research on that issue, and the inverted yield curve is   has been in the United States historically a predictor of an economic downturn. So it's definitely something that catches your eye and gets a lot of attention, and it's understandable given that there's a long history of that.

I think a couple of factors argue to be careful in jumping to that conclusion. One is one of the reasons long-term interest rates in the U.S. are low is because not only the Federal Reserve, but the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and other central banks are   you know, have expanded their balance sheets pretty dramatically over the   over the years and it's putting downward pressure on long-term rates. And not just in the United States; I mean, it's putting downward pressure on long-term rates in Europe and around the world, which in our global financial system then spills back onto the U.S. So some of this may be the effects of various monetary policy actions around the world kind of tilting the yield curve   tilting the yield curve in an unusual way compared to history.

That said, I pay attention to it because I think it is telling us something about where market sentiment is. I mean, if   you know, when market participants in the Treasury market   one of, if not the deepest market in the world out there   if they're   if they're looking at the data and the outlook and the risks to that and are thinking, well, I think that future interest rates are likely to remain very low   or if you think about it from a risk point of view I want to be in Treasurys, I'll pay a premium for a Treasury note or longer-term Treasury security because I think that's good protection against a negative outcome in the global economy   I think it is telling us something about where investor sentiment is, which is maybe negative about longer-term growth, longer-term interest rates, and maybe where the risks are.

So I take that seriously. I don't just look at the, you know, yield curve as a, you know, determinant of whether we're going to have a recession or not, but it is telling us that at least the assessment of markets is relatively pessimistic in terms of growth and interest rates.

MR. HAMILTON: Another development in the last couple weeks that's been getting a lot of discussion is what some people are describing as a liquidity crunch, which led the Federal Reserve to conduct some pretty large repo operations. What's going on with that? What tools do you have available to deal with that?

MR. WILLIAMS: Right, so that is something the New York Fed does. We do have the operational responsibilities for carrying out monetary policy. And so the way I think of it is the FOMC meets every six weeks; we get together and debate the economy   you know, not only domestic economy, global economy, all the issues; decide on a target for the federal funds rate   that's the interest rate on interbank loans, loans between banks, overnight loans. And so the FOMC, we, you know, discuss, debate, and we come to a decision: we want the federal funds rate to trade in a certain range.

And then there is the "make it so" directive   (laughs)   and that goes right to us at the New York Fed, and it's called the directive. And the directive stipulates that it is the desk's responsibility   the desk is the [system open market account] manager group   that group at the New York Fed   to conduct operations, if necessary, to keep the federal funds rate in the range that the FOMC decided on.

Now, over the last, well, almost 10 years, this has been a pretty straightforward job because we had so many reserves in the   held in the banking system. "Reserves," that's a   that's the banks' accounts with the Fed, where that was over $2 trillion. It's still   you know, come down over the last few years, but it's still well over a trillion dollars. And these reserves sitting there in the accounts with the Fed basically were keeping interest rates from moving around, short-term interest rates from moving around a lot. And the way we were conducting monetary policy was the FOMC and the Board of Governors would change what we all administered rates, which is the interest we pay on holding the reserves with us, what we pay the banks to hold, or this rate on overnight reverse repo. So we have these kind of interest rates we set. They influence market rates. But with this huge amount of reserves out there, it basically meant rates didn't move around very much.

What we saw in mid-September   just so you know that was right after Friday the 13th, perhaps an indicator that things were   (laughs)   things might not go well   but what we saw was a confluence of events starting on the Monday and Tuesday after that, the 16th and 17th, where the amount of reserves had come down in the   in the banking system   still very, very high. At the same time, there were huge payment flows early in that week. And this is a predictable part of our financial system, but when corporations pay their quarterly taxes they send huge amounts of money over the wires through our systems to the Treasury and the Treasury holds that in account with us. In addition, we had   Treasury had just conducted very large-scale auctions of Treasury securities, which they do regularly, but those were all being settled around the same time.

So you have this enormous amount of money moving around the financial system, and it looks like one thing that happened was, well, we don't have the super-abundance of reserves we used to have, which meant there was   every bank had a lot in their accounts, and there were some concerns in the   you know, in the financial system about, you know, is this, you know, I need to hold more cash, kind of protect myself in case these   you know, depending on how these big payments affect us. And we see this   saw this show up in what's called the repo market, the Treasury repurchase market, which as I think reported by a number of news stories is a little-known part of the financial system but a really important part of the financial system. This is how the money kind of moves around behind the scenes.

And there was a pulling back of lending, I would say a bit of hunkering down and not taking greater risk over that short period, where we saw interest rates start to move up, these overnight interest rates   not the interest rates you or I pay, but are important in the financial system. So we saw interest rates moving up and not a lot of, you know, lending taking place between the banks that would maybe keep those interest rates lower. And given the directive that we had, which we've had for many, many years, the New York Fed conducted what we call open market operations, which is basically secured lending into the financial system through our standard open market operations which we've done for decades but hadn't done in many years, because there was just no need because interest rates were so stable.

That is a large-scale   these are large-scale operations. When you're in the Fed you know if you're not above hundreds of billions it kind of   you don't notice. So we're talking a significant amount of money being lent into the market. Within a very short period of time interest rates came back down right within our fed funds target range, as we're directed, and we've seen very good stability over the last few weeks there.

So what, you know, this is to me is central banking 101. One of the things we are told to do is   you know, our monetary policy strategy is to carry out monetary policy through controlling short-term interest rates. One of the things that central banks and the Fed has always done when needed is to take   make open market operations to basically make sure short-term interest rates are where we want. We did that. It got a lot of news because it hadn't happened in a long time. But it's been very effective all the way through today.

So it does bring up some bigger issues for us. We have committed in the long term to a strategy where monetary policy basically works on what we call an ample reserves framework, which means there's enough reserves in the system that a given day where payments are moving around really shouldn't have outsized movements in interest rates, at least normally. So we're analyzing what happened in the last couple weeks; understanding all the factors that may have influenced this one-day really spike in interest rates; understanding also how our tool of intervening in the markets in terms of doing open market operations, how effective that was and how to best think about that for the future; and doing a lot of analysis about how do we basically structure our operational framework in a way that we get to where we want to be, which is   we've described as that open market operations are not a frequent part of controlling interest rates, but obviously always there as needed, as they were in the last couple weeks, to keep interest rates where we want them to be.

MR. HAMILTON: Another place where we're hearing a lot of discussion of the Federal Reserve is from the White House. President Trump has been very vocal and very tweetful   (laughter)   in suggesting the Fed needs to cut rates more and more, and since he started talking about that the Fed cut rates twice and there's now a discussion about resuming quantitative easing. How has what the president's said influenced the FOMC?

MR. WILLIAMS: So comments by political figures, whether it's the president or anyone, have no effect whatsoever on how we're thinking about monetary policy. You started this conversation exactly where we start our conversations, we end our conversations, which is this dual mandate   the maximum employment and the price stability goals.

If you ever want to see how nerdy the Fed is and the   there's some Fed people here so they are like, yeah, we know   but if you ever want to see how nerdy we are, after five years we publish the transcripts of our FOMC meetings. Now, they don't get a lot of attention because they're so nerdy, but what we do is we are poring over the data, poring over all of the   what we're hearing from across the country, the different Federal Reserve presidents, the governors. We have hundreds and hundreds of Ph.D. economists studying the U.S. and global economies, the financial and banking systems, understanding what's going on there.

So we spend a whole day every two   the first day of the FOMC meeting   it's a two-day meeting. We spend the first day just sharing information from our economists, from what we're hearing from our business contacts, every   and from our   you know, all the analysis we do about where the economy is, where it's likely to go, what the risks are, and a lot of scenario analysis.

In fact, I always give this example. If you think about what it's like   because I'm   you know, I'm an   I'm an   you know, I am an economist. I love   I love economics. I love what we do. So we have currently 17 participants in the FOMC, the 12 presidents and five governors. If each one talked for roughly 10 minutes   and mostly it's a little less than that   but just do the math. So you got 10 minutes times 17, so that's roughly three hours straight of people talking about the economy, plus the formal briefings plus the discussion. Even for me, that's a lot of talking about the economy in one day. (Laughter.)

So we do take coffee breaks. We do have lunch breaks and things like that. But we basically stick to that analysis, think about our mandate goals, and make our policy decisions as appropriate. We've always done that. I've been at the Fed, I just   for 25 years. That's the way it's been under every chair that I've worked with with my colleagues.

When it comes to thinking about, you know, when we   you know, we have lowered interest rates a couple times. I go back to this, you know, story of we're in a very favorable place, the economy's strong. I think we're basically, you know, close to our maximum employment goal. Inflation's a little below 2 percent, but pretty close. So my view is we got to keep the economy roughly where it is, inflation a little bit higher. But you know, we're in a good place. And so the adjustment of monetary policy, from my perspective, is really about looking at where the economy is likely to go, where the risks are   especially the ones we've already talked about   and also the fact that we are seeing signs of the economy slowing somewhat and we want to get monetary policy positioned to keep the economy growing at a sustainable pace, keep the labor market strong, and keep inflation, you know, this 2 percent goal. Those are the reasons and arguments for the adjustments we made in monetary policy that we made, and those are the reasons we   will always influence our thinking about how to conduct monetary policy in the future.

MR. HAMILTON: So the European Central Bank has also been trying to move to more stimulus. It recently moved to even more negative interest rates than they had. How do negative interest rates in Europe affect our ability to chart our own course in the United States?

MR. WILLIAMS: Well, you know, it is an important point. I mean, we are not   you know, we are not an island, obviously. We are a part of a global economy and a global financial system. And as I mentioned, the fact that the European Central Bank, or ECB, other central banks, have gone to negative rates, have done enormous quantitative easing   basically buying assets that push down long-term interest rates   clearly has effects on our financial conditions, primarily though the effects on the longer-term bond rates that we talked about, also in terms of the dollar. So those, again, global markets. Everything that's happening around the world affects us in different ways.

You know, the way I think about this, we all have domestic mandates. For the Federal Reserve, it was maximum employment in the United States, price stability in the United States. We don't have a mandate to stabilize the global economy. The European Central Bank similarly as a domestic European   you know, euro area mandate. So what I   how I view   I'm not comment, you know, whether I agree or disagree. It's not my place to talk about what they're doing. But what they're doing clearly is to try to keep their economy   they're trying to do the same thing we're doing. They're trying to keep the euro area economy strong, growing, and get inflation closer to their goal.

To the extent that Europe can be successful through monetary and other policies to have a strong European economy, to the extent that other countries can create more growth and strength, that actually will be beneficial to us. It will help us in terms of exports, in terms of some of these other factors. So, you know, when I look at does it make it harder for us, I think what would make it harder for us is if Europe   as the European economies weaken further, or inflation came down further, I think that would actually make it harder for us, because then we would basically be dealing with an even slower global economy, which would then feed back to us.

So I don't think what they're doing   what happens around the world is actually going to make it harder. I think in some ways it's making it easier. But it does remind us of an important point. The global economy is not in nearly as strong a place as the U.S. economy. I mean, Japan, the ECB, and other countries in Europe that aren't part of the euro all have, you know, either very low or negative interest rates, all have inflation rates well below their goals. So this is a context that we're conducting monetary policy. I think the big challenge for us is we're in a good place, we're near our goals, but there's basically this, you know, downward pressure on   global downward pressure on inflation and growth that we're having to manage through.

MR. HAMILTON: Following up on that with another even nerdier question, I guess. LIBOR, the London interbank borrowing and offering rate. So that's an interest rate between European banks, but loans in dollars which, at some points, had some pretty big influence on interest rates consumers in the U.S. paid and the financial system. Is the Federal Reserve doing anything to try to reduce the influence of LIBOR in the U.S.?

MR. WILLIAMS: Right. So LIBOR is fundamentally flawed. It just   it needs to go. That is a   so what it is   what you described was actually a little more positive than I would, I think. (Laughs.) It is a   it has had scandals associated with it over years, basically manipulation. The real problem with LIBOR   which, you know, does underly something like $200 trillion of securities or financial instruments, I should say   is that we have learned that the number   it's not based on real transactions. This is a quoted rate. So where people, banks, are asked, what rate would you be able to fund at? Or, depending on the jurisdiction, you know, what exactly the question says, it depends on that. But it's basically, like, what do you think the interest would be, but not based on transactions.

So what we've seen globally, the work that the Financial Stability Board, which I am involved in personally in my role in the New York Fed, is to get us off   globally off some of these what we call IBORs, not just the London ones, but some of the others. Either through strengthening   and in many jurisdictions they're going this path   is the strengthening the foundations of these interest rates, making them more transaction based, making them more resilient, and more representative of funding costs. So we're seeing a number of countries move to that. For LIBOR, the real problem is that because of the fact this isn't based on real transactions, because of other reasons dealing with the scandals of the last many years, many of the banks have indicated they don't want to be actually answering these surveys.

So Financial Conduct Authority, the FCA, in the U.K., who has the oversight of the U.S. LIBOR, the LIBOR markets, has indicated that   has come to basically an understanding that the banks will continue to basically to give their views on what interest rates are, but only through 2021. So in the U.K. there's a very strong focus that we   these rates fundamentally are not   in the future may be not be truly representative or robust to financial conditions. So the way I think about it, and growing up in California and having gone through this, you want your financial system to be built   if you think about the house, you want to have a really good foundation. And you want to attach your house to your foundation   two things that were missing in my last house in the bay area. So   (laughter)   so when you realize the   you know, LIBOR is such a foundational aspect of so much of global markets, and U.S. derivatives markets, and adjustable rate mortgages and things, it's not a solid foundation. And it's not something that we have a long-run   we can count on in the long-run.

So there's been a lot of work in the United States and around the world on this, moving away from LIBOR. And that work has accomplished a lot. And one of the things we do at the New York Fed is we sponsor this group of the private sector group with involvement in the public sector to basically get the private sector to come up with solutions to find how do we go from LIBOR to something else. I'll tell you what that is in a minute. And then, how do we take the entire financial system, unplug its dependence on LIBOR, and plug in the same dependence on this new rate? And this takes many years of work. It's already been several years.

It's going to take a few more years to get there. There's a lot of work going on in the private sector. There's work going on with the U.S. government, foreign governments around an accounting boards, around accounting practices, tax practices, regulatory and supervisory issues. Basically to ease this transition to this. So what's the future for the U.S.? This industry has focused really on something called SOFR [or the secured overnight financing rate], which is a rate that is   the New York Fed actually collects all the data on enormous number of repurchase agreements, or repo market transactions. It's a real interest rates based on real transactions done according to the highest standards.

We report it every morning, the rate from the previous day. We are also doing a lot of research and public work on providing next kind of greater, you know, ease of use, if you will, around the SOFR rate, providing a SOFR index, a SOFR average rate. And there's been a lot of work saying, here is how SOFR or SOFR-related instruments can replace LIBOR for U.S. dollar LIBOR. I gave a speech a couple months ago saying there's only 901 days left of LIBOR. So we have a lot of work to do to get off LIBOR and to get onto SOFR, or other instruments, for U.S. dollar LIBOR. But, you know, we have a timeline. A lot of work is being done.

I think the biggest challenge right now is as these markets, these SOFR-based markets have grown, and gotten more acceptance and deeper markets, we just need to see more and more of that happening. And really the way I'd put it is, you know, just stop writing LIBOR-based instruments, because they   you know, you're just making the mountain bigger in terms of this transition. So that's my longwinded answer. I do think that we've made a lot of progress in getting away from reference rates that aren't robust, or potentially could not be representative in moving to a much more solid foundation. And the New York Fed and the Board of Governors in Washington have been pushing hard on that and will continue for the next 820-some days. (Laughs.)

MR. HAMILTON: So we've touched on a lot of issues. As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, what's keeping you awake at night?

MR. WILLIAMS: Well, what's been keeping me awake the last couple weeks has been these short-term interest rate moves and understanding what's going on. That's a very kind of   you know, issue, as I talked about, really understanding what's happening in the plumbing of the financial system, why, you know, given that there's a lot of reserves in the system, how do we make sure that that money is moving around freely and understanding the different factors that are affecting that, and what are our policy decisions.

I think in terms of monetary policy, it's really a little bit of what you talked about. We're in uncharted waters in terms of trade and geopolitical uncertainties. We can talk about trade tensions. We talk about Brexit. Obviously geopolitical concerns in the Middle East, in Hong Kong, in South America. So this is a time where there's just a lot of uncertainty out there. How does that affect the economy? And then back to this basic economics question of, you know, to what extent is that affecting the supply or potential of the economy, versus affecting demand? And what's the right way for monetary policy to respond?

There's always a hope that we could just, you know, turn monetary policy over to a computer or an app, I guess, and figure out, you know, given the economy's here, here's what the Fed should do. This just, I think, illustrates how   what complex environment we're dealing with. And a lot of things that, you know, perhaps we hadn't encountered as much in the past   very negative interest rates, you know, big trade and geopolitical tensions around the world. And, again, very   relatively low global growth and very low interest rates, even in economies that are doing well. And we have to take all of that into account in trying to make the best decisions we can.

MR. HAMILTON: Well, maybe at this point we can open it up to questions from all of you...

Q: ...Thank you so much for coming and for treating us to this presentation. As a former Fed guy, I was on the banking side, I really pay attention to financial stability. Some of the FOMC dissenters recently have pointed out the interplay between loose policy   or maybe you wouldn't say it's loose   and financial stability. Given the two trends of post-crisis regulatory reforms, which have pushed some intermediation out of the regulated banking sector into the shadow banking sector, and the impact of low-rate policy pushing investors higher out the yield risk return curve, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about financial stability as you debate rates?

MR. WILLIAMS: So you're absolutely right, I won't call it loose monetary policy. (Laughter.) So first   I will get to your question, which is a great question. Obviously one that we're all focused on. But this idea of what is loose monetary policy is   I think we have to have kind of a reality check on what normal is for interest rates. So if you asked me   and I did a lot of work on this back in the '90s   what's a normal federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate? And normal, with 2 percent inflation, would have been about 4 percent. So 2 percent inflation rate, 2 percent real after inflation return for short-term interest rates. That's pretty much where it had been on average for 25 years. And maybe a little higher sometimes, a little lower other times, but roughly a 4 percent federal funds rate.

Based on a lot of analysis, views of my colleagues at the Fed, views of the market participants, views from places like the Congressional Budget Office and others, pretty much everybody has lowered their view of what a normal short-term interest rate is, from something like 4 percent 20 years ago and, depending on your own estimate, something closer to probably like 2  percent. Two percent inflation, half percent real rate, or maybe, you know, three quarters. So we've seen this big move to say it used to be a normal federal funds rate would be 4. So if you looked at the current level of the federal funds rate, which is below 2 percent, then you'd say, well, that's loose monetary policy. And I would agree, back then.

But today if your normal   view of normal is 2, and we're, you know, just a big above 2, sure, we're slightly   somewhat below the long-run normal. But not by very much. And again, compared to the history, it might be   if you thought 4 was normal, we're, you know, somewhere above four in that kind of comparison. So I think that that's something that we always have to remind ourselves, that with lower neutral interest rates, normal interest rates, the way the benchmark against whether policy is tight or loose is just   it's different than the past.

But getting to your question, I   you know, it's been a big topic. Two things coming together. One is we do have a much stronger regulatory system in terms of bank capital, liquidity and resolutions. And we have a much stronger banking system in terms of regulation. And we are in a world of very low interest rates   partly because of monetary policy, partly because of this kind of new normal low interest rates. We definitely have seen certain investors take more duration risk, take more credit risk. We see this depending on the class of investor. You see it maybe in insurance companies, pension funds, and others. But more generally, in this low rate environment, perhaps not surprising, we've seen some more greater risk taking in the financial   out there in the economy. We've definitely seen this in the leverage loans and kind of the lower credit quality business borrowing. So whether in high-yield bonds, or in leverage loans, or things like that.

So a couple things I would just respond. First of all, I think the best defense against that is a strong regulatory system that protects the financial system from the inevitable downturns, or cycles, or whatever you think about. So this financial system can take a hit if we see a downturn in a sector, or in the economy, or even a pullback in asset prices, something like that. So we want to have a financial sector that's more resilient, and I think the regulatory changes have really supported that. The second is, is that we have seen a lot of activity move out of the regulated banking sector into the, what you called, shadow banking. But if you think about this it's private equity, hedge funds, direct lending. There's a lot of activity that used to be done, or perhaps much more   banks were much more involved or used to carry this out. It's now moving out of that.

That is both an intended consequence of regulation, because what we   what we wanted   what we wanted to see is the banking, the center, the core of the financial system which, you know, does a lot of maturity transformation, obviously leverage and all that, that to be very rock solid. Of course, we want risk-taking to happen in the economy. We want innovation. We want to see that happen, but not in a way that threatens the center or the core of the financial system. So we are seeing greater risk taking outside the banking sector. I think that's part of our financial system. One of the things we look at is, first of all, does it create these financial stability risks, and what are the tradeoffs?

And personally, my view is that the risks seem to be   these are huge financial stability risks. So the fact that there's more lending to corporate businesses   and right now it doesn't look like a big financial stability risk. I do see that as more of an amplifier, if there's an economic downturn that there's a lot of loans out there to businesses that may default. There'll be potentially losses there. And that could affect the business cycle in a negative way. So we've done a lot of analysis thinking through if there's an economic   a negative economic developments, how will that play out in terms of, you know, the growth in corporate indebtedness, and leverage, and things like that. And making sure that we understand that, and kind of prepare for that.

Right now, my view is we got monetary   obviously, you know, we got monetary policy in the right place. (Laughs.) I think we are taking into consideration all these other issues. But I don't see financial stability risks of those kind as really being the front and center in terms of where we are. Really it's getting interest rates where we want to keep this economy strong.

Q: ...This is a rearview mirror question.

MR. WILLIAMS: OK.

Q: Can you quantify the change in employment domestically since January of 2017, and explain the reasons for it?

MR. WILLIAMS: Why the growth in  

Q: Yes.

MR. WILLIAMS: Well, you know, so this economy is growing   you know, has been growing very well in the last few years. There's no question about that. We've seen, you know, employment growth   we've seen employment growth every month during the expansion. We've seen continued job gains well above what we think of as kind of the steady state or, you know, the number of job gains you would expect in an economy that's just adding enough jobs for the new entrants in the growth in the labor force. So we've seen job gains go from over 250,000, slowed a bit in the first part of   so far this, somewhat. But still job gains that are way above what we think of as kind of a steady state.

So we've seen a very strong labor market. Importantly, we've seen a big improvement in labor force participation. After the recession labor force participation   meaning, are you actually looking for a job or do you have a job   went down a lot, especially not just for   because of the aging of the workforce, but we saw it among people who were kind of in the middle of their careers. That's been coming back really nicely, especially over the last couple years. So what I see when you ask me, like, how is the labor market doing, and how has it been doing consistently? It's still very strong. We're still adding jobs at a very healthy clip on average.

And what   if anything what's been kind of the good news here is that the unemployment rate hasn't   has stayed steady because we see more people join back into the labor force or not leave the labor force. You know, different ways the labor force changes. So we're seeing more jobs. We're seeing more people get back engaged in the labor force. And that means that   and we haven't seen huge   we've seen good gains and wages, but we haven't seen inflationary pressures. So all the things I've learned in the last couple years is   from this experience   is we   this economy can handle this growth, this very solid growth. We can handle in terms of without creating inflationary pressures continued pretty strong job growth, and very low unemployment.

So to me, the big lesson of really this whole experience of a very strong labor market is my view of, you know, what's this maximum employment level? It's higher than I previously thought. We are not seeing inflationary pressures, so that's good. We can   we can have that strong economy. And that means a lower unemployment rate than perhaps if you asked me five years ago, what's the unemployment rate consistent with maximum employment, a lot of research and a lot of the evidence shows that that number is even lower than we thought. And, again, these are more like supply-side arguments, but they're ones that mean that we can have a really strong economy and without creating inflation.

Q: ...This may be a nerdish question   a question and a very quick comment, John. The question has to do with what would happen if, unfortunately, there was a recession coming up soon with the funds rate at around 2 percent-ish? In the past we've had the Fed lowering the funds rate four-plus percentage points at times of recession. What is in the tool bag that could give us some confidence? Or do you see, like, a monetary, fiscal combination, more so than in the past? Or what's your thought on that?

My quick comment is that 40 years ago   I just looked this up   yesterday Ed Kane, noted monetary economist, wrote a paper in the JME in which his hypothesis was that the Fed's political role is to serve as a scapegoat   (laughter)   when bad things happen for incumbent politicians. And it seems like we have another data point to support that. (Applause.) Thank you, John.

MR. WILLIAMS: The   (laughs)   in terms of the ability to respond to a downturn   and, you know, first of all, we should be clear. Recessions are very, very hard to predict. We have economists in this room, and we all know that we're OK   as we were talking about this this morning   we're probably OK at seeing that we're in a recession. I did paper on this. Economists are really good at saying we just had a recession. (Laughter.) They're actually really good at this. Not as good at saying we're expecting a recession. And probably the indicators that tell us about that are   it's because it's happening now, whether it's, you know, labor market indicators or things have turned.

So I think we should just be humble about that. Right now the outlook is actually very favorable. GDP growth roughly at trend. Labor market that's very strong. Unemployment well below 4 percent. And inflation around 2 percent. So the baseline and, you know, a lot of the analysis in I think most forecasts is a positive one. But you're asking a good question: What happens   you know, what happens if there's a downturn in the economy? And you're absolutely right, if you look back at history the Fed has typically cut interest rates by 4 or 5 or more percentage points in response to a real recession.

So I think   and we don't have nearly as much what we call cushion or maneuvering room to cut interest rates before we get close to zero. So I think, what's the playbook look like? You know, first of all, dependent on circumstances, depending what is   how long the recession or the downturn looks to last, what are the various factors and the assessment of that.

But if you think about the toolkit we have and the playbook, well, a lot of them are the ones that we used in the last   (audio break)   appropriate to support the economy. But one of the things we did is we called forward guidance where we indicate in our statements or our communication that we expect interest rates to stay lower for longer than otherwise to provide extra stimulus we saw back in the period of 2011 and the following years that this forward guidance did shift market expectations of when the Fed was going to raise interest rates, where interest rates were going to be pushed down barring costs, lowered mortgage rates, you know, things like that.

So, definitely, we can   and use our communication and, basically, explain our policy in a way that I think can lower interest rates because it's more of   it's more of explaining what we're expecting to do in the future, not just what we're doing today.

The other tool that we use very aggressively in multiple steps was what we call large-scale asset purchases but everybody else calls QE, or quantitative easing   basically, buying longer-term treasuries or longer-term mortgage-backed securities   these assets in large scale to the point that we had over   a balance sheet of over $4.5 trillion at one time. Buying them from the open market, that pushes the price up. That pushes the yields down. We saw that translate to lower mortgage rates, lower corporate volume rates, more supported financial conditions and supported growth.

So we have the same tool. We have the tool kit that we used in the last decade. I think two important things to remember, we   when we did forward guidance and QE back in the day, we didn't have a lot of experience with that, and there was a lot of discussion would it work, what are the tradeoffs, a lot of concern that QE would lead to really high inflation or a lot of other issues.

I think we've learned a lot both about the benefits and some of the limitations. But we've also learned some of the concerns about the costs and the potential negative effects were much   ended up being much smaller than some of the fears. So I think that that gives me more confidence that we could use those tools more quickly and more effectively early on in a future downturn, if that happens.

But I do think that   you mentioned fiscal policy. In a world of very low interest rates where we don't have as much room to provide stimulus to the economy, having fiscal policy play a supporting role is, obviously, important. In Europe, they're talking a lot about how does fiscal policy support growth.

In the U.S., fortunately, we tend to have fiscal policy be expansionary during recessions because of actions by Congress. But I think that is an important piece of that. To the extent that fiscal policy, monetary policy, would both be working to help support the economy during a downturn, obviously, that makes it easier to get back to maximum employment and the 2 percent goal than if it were trying to do it all on our own.

Q: Thank you for being here. Given unprecedented negative interest rates, unprecedented debt levels across the globe, but also unprecedented   the availability of data and the accusations maybe, to the gentleman's point, the Fed as the scapegoat   of the Fed being behind the ball in some of its models, how are you using data and AI and other things to improve what you're doing today?

MR. WILLIAMS: So that's a big topic in the Fed and I think central banking around the world when we get together   how do we better leverage data, how do we better leverage new ways to organize and get information out of data.

One of my favorite quips was that as an economist working in, you know, the policy world, you know, you're always having to learn new methods, new techniques, new ways, new data sets, and we're always doing that.

I think this AI machine learning and the natural language processing too, which is a big topic, think about communication and gathering information from markets is an area that we need to be focused on. We're talking about developing that. We've already got some pilot projects that the New York Fed and other Feds are working on this.

I think that what we really need to do, in my experience, is get the same level of insights around causation and identification that we use in economics, in our models, and our analysis of different hypotheses and bring those in more to the big data.

There's no question about that we're using a lot of this financial market and other datas in our analysis. But I think that as we think about these huge data sets, like, when I talk to people at Visa or Google or others, they have this enormous unstructured data   how do we bring that in and start actually doing the kinds of things that we want to do.

We're not interested in just the correlations and the kind of all the things that are happening. Usually we have very specific questions that we're interested in now do we get at that in that world. So there's a lot of work going on there.

We, in New York, are very focused on that. We also need to do this because the banks are doing this. The banks that we supervise   you know, some of the largest banks in the country they are investing hugely in this and, you know, starting to develop business models around how they use data, making, you know, business decisions. So we need to be able to do that not just for the macroeconomic policy   the monetary policy   but also in supervising in these institutions.

Q: Thank you again for coming. I'm Tyler Cramer. I happen to be a member of National Assessment Governing Board, which is the   oversees the nation's report card and that's the one that reports that 37 percent of the kids are proficient in reading in the country.

On July 10th, [Fed] Chairman [Jerome] Powell testified and he was asked a question   it was before Congress   and he testified that   a question, I believe, that was asked about what fiscal policy would be important to helping the Fed achieve its goal. One of the first things he mentioned was education and investment in education.

And so it got me to thinking, have there been any studies inside the Fed? You got, as you said, a bunch of nerds, which have correlated the investments in education that we're making in the country with the impact on your goals? And, like, the only ones I know of are the ones by Rick Hanushek at Stanford for GDP. But maybe you know others.

MR. WILLIAMS: Right. That's a terrific topic in question because when you think about this maximum employment goal, we kind of take that as   the economy as that's handed to us. You know, we are making monetary policy in the world that we live in and try to achieve that goal subject to that.

But, obviously, as soon as you think about it for even a moment you say, well, wait a minute, what are the things we could do that would change the answer to that question or what could we do in terms of education or job training or other things what would raise what our economic potential is or maximum employment is or, you know, real wages are.

So completely agree with that premise that the question of what can be achieved, not just, you know, us trying to achieve that but is really the first order of importance. So in terms of research, I mean, there's been an enormous amount of research in the academic world but also connecting some of the reserve banks, and I'm thinking about the   my colleagues in Minneapolis who have done decades of work on early childhood education.

Just showing that the return on investment, you know, the business kind of lingo on spending on early childhood education, on, you know, the earlier you can help people from   especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, get education and continuing that through the school years, the returns to them, to the communities, to the economy are enormous. We have just a huge underinvestment in that.

In fact, as you go higher up the ladder now   probably this is not going to be popular   the returns   you know , at the higher levels are positive. I mean, we are a knowledge economy. We need to be investing in people for the future, and kind of getting back to that last question about artificial intelligence and everything. But really, if you say the lowest hanging fruit are the youngest people, the people who will be working for decades and decades, especially those who otherwise are disadvantaged, so there's, clearly, a lot of research that shows that in terms of productivity, in terms of labor market attachment, in terms of social mobility, all these things are related to that.

You know, the Fed can't fund that or do that. But we can, you know   it comes up in a lot of speeches. When I talk about this issue, I often give a speech about, you know, low trend growth in the U.S. and I highlight the three things that we should   we could do to change that   bend that curve.

One is this education issue, especially with getting people earlier in life. The second is infrastructure and investments that really have long-term effects on our productivity, and the third is really research and development, really expanding the frontier of science or other areas. These are all the things that have long run payoffs that takes decades and decades that change productivities, standards of living, and, really, the health and resilience of our economy.

So those are, I think, the research from the academic world and including people in the Fed, pretty consistent on that. But, in the end, those decisions are made by others and, you know, all   you know, I think what we can do is be that mutual party in terms of researchers doing their best analysis sharing that and being part of that conversation. And, you know, people say why don't you speak up more about it, and I do. I give these comments in speeches sometimes. I'm just kind of waiting for that to actually happen more.

I'll give you a concrete example. In Japan, one of the things that the government did in Japan, they wanted to raise labor force participation of women in Japan, and this is one   it's not education but it was a problem that people said was really intractable. For various reasons, women have a very low labor force participation.

But the government, you know, looked at what are the reasons that you have this issue, whether it's childcare or other issues and conducted   you know, made policies and, you know, over time made decisions that, you know, changed maybe the incentivizes and the financial ability to that, and we've seen labor force participation rise quite a bit in just a few years.

So, you know, I think there's a reminder that you actually   you know, if you change the underlying policies and incentives then you can actually get these outcomes.

Good day! Los Angeles-based buyout firm Platinum Equity has been grilled at public pension board meetings across the country about its investment in prison phone operator Securus Technologies Inc. However, strong past performance appears to have trumped the public criticism as Platinum approaches the $9 billion mark for its latest fund, as Chris Cumming reports this morning for WSJ Pro.

Platinum isn't the only firm taking heat for investments in companies that provide services to prisons. Yesterday Sen. Elizabeth Warren took aim at private-equity investments in prison operators and companies that serve them, specifically naming five private-equity firms, including Platinum. We will unpack more of that tomorrow.

Meanwhile, Laura Cooper has news of Hammond Kennedy Whitney & Co.'s newest fund, while Luis Garcia looks at the evolution of Mexico's development-capital securities, or CKDs, as the security hits its 10th birthday. And investment banks have struggled to raise about $2 billion of debt for Apollo Global Management's takeover of Shutterfly.

Now on to today's news...

Today's Top Stories

Platinum Nears Second Closing Above $9 Billion for Latest Fund

Platinum Equity, the private-equity firm led by Tom Gores, is approaching a fundraising milestone for its largest vehicle yet. The fund, Platinum Equity Capital Partners V LP, is expected to soon hold a second closing at more than $9 billion and then to hold a final close at its $10 billion hard cap before the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The first closing, in July, came at about $7.2 billion, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows.

Hammond Kennedy Whitney Collects $365 Million for Fifth Fund

Hammond Kennedy Whitney & Co. has collected $365 million for its fifth fund, the first raised by the Indianapolis-based firm since a transition of partners in 2014. HKW Capital Partners V surpassed its original $350 million target, and also collected more capital than its predecessor fund, which amassed $319 million and began investing in 2012.

Mexican CKD Prominence Ebbs as Security Marks First Decade

A security instrumental to the development of Mexico's private-equity industry is completing 10 years of existence just as new rules could make it less relevant. Created in 2009, Mexico's development-capital certificates, known as CKDs, opened the doors for Mexican pension funds to invest in local alternative assets. However, restrictions on investing capital raised through CKDs eventually gave rise to another new security, one that permits Mexican pension funds to invest in alternative assets internationally. With these pensions busy building their allocation to global funds, most of their alternative-asset investment now goes through investment-project certificates, or Cerpis.

Banks Struggle to Sell Debt for Apollo's Shutterfly Buyout

Investment banks have struggled in recent days to raise about $2 billion of debt for Apollo Global Management's buyout of Shutterfly Inc., highlighting investors' newfound caution toward the riskiest portions of the credit markets, Matt Wirz and Alexander Gladstone report for the Journal. Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc. and other banks Apollo hired for the sale agreed to buy up to $280 million of the financing themselves after failing to find enough outside investors, people familiar with the matter said.

TPG-Backed Mini-Mill Sells Minority Stake to U.S. Steel

TPG-backed Big River Steel, an electric mini-mill in Arkansas, has agreed to sell a 49.9% stake in itself to U.S. Steel Corp. for about $700 million in cash. The deal includes an option for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel to acquire the rest of the company within four years. The deal gives the company an implied enterprise value of about $2.33 billion, including an expansion project that is under way in northeast Arkansas. Once completed, the expansion will bring the Osceola, Ark.-based company's annual production capacity to 3.3 million tons of flat-rolled steel. TPG and the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System each own 20% of the company, while Koch Industries Inc. holds a 40% interest. The transaction is expected to close this month, and TPG and Koch are expected to remain preferred equity holders of the maker of flat-rolled steel.

Advent International Corp. said it has completed its purchase of Industria Chimica Emiliana, an Italian company that produces Ursodeoxycholic Acid, or UDCA, an active pharmaceutical ingredient primarily used in drugs that treat gastroenterological and chronic diseases.

Exits

Apollo-backed ADT Inc. has agreed to sell its Canadian operations, ADT Security Services Canada Inc., to Telus Corp. for about 700 million Canadian dollars ($532 million) in cash. The unit generated fiscal 2018 revenue of about $229 million. Apollo Global Management Inc. acquired three security monitoring firms through its Apollo Investment Fund VIII, starting in July 2015 and ending in May 2016 with the take-private purchase of ADT. The New York firm and co-investors contributed $3.6 billion of equity and ADT took on more than $10 billion in debt financing, giving the transaction a total enterprise value of about $15 billion. In January 2018, ADT went public again, but Apollo still owned 84% of the company's shares, or roughly 644.5 million, as of April of this year. In addition to the sale, ADT said its board had authorized a one-time special dividend of as much as $550 million, or 70 cents a share.

Industry News

Elizabeth Warren is leading another charge at private-equity firms, this time demanding documents and explanations from those with portfolio companies that provide services to prison operations and inmates. Joined by two fellow Democratic members of Congress, the Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate has sent inquiries to BlueMountain Capital Management, H.I.G. Capital, American Securities, Apax Partners and Platinum Equity. She has asked the firms to respond with documents by Oct. 14, and "to explain their role in the consolidation and deterioration of the prison services industry" by then as well. Earlier, the Bay State senator accused some private-equity firms of acting like "vampires" in the way they treat portfolio companies and their employees.

Bayou Steel BD Holdings LLC, a private equity-owned steel producer that relies on imports, filed for bankruptcy after shutting down a steel mill in LaPlace, La., that employs close to 400 workers. Bayou said Monday's bankruptcy filing resulted from "a severe lack of liquidity" that pushed the company's senior secured debt into default and prevented it from purchasing raw materials. The company, owned by Black Diamond Capital Management LLC since 2006, didn't give more specific reasons for the LaPlace mill closure in filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. But in a statement Monday, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D.) said the company, which relies on imported recycled scrap metal, "is particularly vulnerable to tariffs."

The withdrawal of WeWork parent's initial public offering after its $47 billion private valuation wouldn't have come as a surprise for investors watching its performance in the secondary market. Shareholders of We Co. were hard-pressed to find private buyers in the secondary market willing to pay even half of the high valuation SoftBank Group Corp. paid earlier this year, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports, citing people familiar with the matter.

Funds invested drop by almost half in first nine months to $4bn as Cfius steps up scrutiny

Chinese venture capital investment into the US has fallen this year to its lowest level since 2015 as heightened US scrutiny over national security intensifies financial decoupling between the world s two largest economies.

But as Chinese funds fight shy of the US, they are turning their energies to Asia. India and south-east Asia are a particular focus, with Chinese venture capital investment in India surpassing that in the US in the latest quarter, according to data from Refinitiv.

 The critical technology areas are directly impacted,  said Scott Kupor, managing partner at US venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, referring to the growing influence of Washington s national security concerns over the investment environment.

 It s definitely an impediment to anybody being really serious about taking Chinese money right now in the start-up community,  he said.

Chinese funds invested just $4bn in US companies in the first nine months of 2019. That is the smallest amount since 2015, down from nearly $7bn in the same timeframe last year and $9bn in the same 2017 period, according to Refinitiv. Overall foreign investment in US venture capital was $51bn in the first nine months of 2019, Refinitiv said.

That pullback matches a broader drying up of Chinese foreign direct investmentinto the US. Chinese FDI   a category that does not include venture capital   fell to $5.4bn in 2018 from $29b in 2017, according to data from Rhodium Group.

Refinitiv data showed the venture capital downdraught intensified in the latest quarter, with only $813m in venture capital inflows from Chinese funds recorded   a 70 per cent drop from the same quarter last year.

One of the main deterrents, according to analysts, was scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), which reviews transactions involving foreign investors that may pose a security risk.

Cfius intensified its scrutiny last year, implementing a programme to inspect minority investments in US companies making  critical technology  such as military equipment, semiconductors and dual use  technologythat could have both civilian and military applications. It also expanded its remit to take in a broader range of deals including joint ventures.

Oversight of investment in US tech companies is particularly strong in areas such as artificial intelligence and software where  dual use  is regarded as a potential risk.

 This day and age, it s hard to imagine a lot of companies that don t employ some form of artificial intelligence in their software development,  said Mr Kupor, who testified before the US Senate last year on Cfius reforms.

Roger Robinson, president and chief executive of RWR Advisory Group, a risk consultancy in Washington DC, said Chinese groups were shunning investments and acquisitions in the US to avoid  embarrassing Cfius turn-downs .

 Certainly start-ups recognise that taking Chinese investment capital could prove the kiss of death to their acceptance as defence contractors, or even government procurement more broadly,  he said.

Chinese investorshave instead raised their spending in Asia. Manyare also driven by a  motivation to capitalise on technological niches in the region, which are now becoming more apparent , said Yinglan Tan, managing partner of Singapore-based venture capital firm Insignia Ventures Partners.

Mr Kupor said he hoped regulators would reconsider the mandatory Cfius review of certain minority investments, warning the  genie is out of the bottle .

 Capital and technology will flow to whichever geography has the most attractive environment overall,  he said.

Machines pose threat to 200,000 bank jobs

Financial services

US banks will cut more than 200,000 jobs in the next decade as robots and other technology bring about the "greatest transfer from labour to capital" the industry has ever seen, a new report by analysts at Wells Fargo claims.

Cuts of this magnitude would represent more than 10 per cent of total bank jobs and clear the way for a "golden age of banking efficiency", according to Mike Mayo, a veteran Wall Street analyst who led the report.

"It's been a rocky 25-year marriage for banking and technology but it's finally getting on course," he said.

Individual banks have predicted that machines could replace thousands of jobs. These include Citigroup chief executive Mike Corbat, who said "tens of thousands" of call centre workers could be replaced, and former Deutsche Bank boss John Cryan who warned in 2017 that as many as half the bank's 97,000-strong workforce could go.

Wells Fargo's team of financial services and technology analysts looked at the impact of technology across the US banking industry. In their 225-page report, they detailed how artificial intelligence could reduce mortgage processing costs by 10 to 20 per cent, while big data would allow "more surgical marketing" and cloud computing could yield significant savings.

"Banks spend more on tech than any other industry (c$150bn a year), and, therefore, better get their money's worth," the analysts wrote.

The job cuts would be felt most heavily in back offices, branches and call centres where staff numbers could fall by 20 to 30 per cent, Wells Fargo said. The biggest savings would be at larger banks as "technology is a game changer for scale", according to Mr Mayo.

The job cuts would reverse a largely unbroken trend of net job creation in the US banking industry. Data from the FDIC show that the industry's collective headcount has only shrunk on 16 occasions since 1935 and never by more than 55,000 in a single year.

"They don't have a choice," said Mr Mayo on whether banks would be prepared to cut so many employees. "The banking industry is a slower growing industry than it's been in the past ... Half of the banks' costs are compensation, there aren't many other levers to use."

Tech Scroll Asia, your guide to the billions made and lost in Asia tech

FT subscribers can click here to receive Tech Scroll Asia by email.

First of all, thanks for your interest in our forthcoming US events. In case you missed it, together with the Asia Society s Center on US-China Relations, we will be holding two events in the US, in New York on October 16 and San Francisco on October 17:The Great Decoupling and the Sino-US Race for Technological Supremacy.

We have secured a few more free seats for Tech Scroll Asia readers for the New York one, so please reply torsvp@ft.comif you wish to attend. The agenda ishere. The San Francisco event, in partnership with UC Berkeley, still has a few spots left so please registerhere. We both hope to see you there!

Hi everyone  here is your bumper  US-China decoupling  issue. Chinese venture capital firms   once so enamoured of the US start-up scene   are pulling in their horns. The US has also considered restrictions on Chinese listings in New York. But amid all this, PayPal has secured entry into the huge Chinese digital payments market. Switching to India, New Delhi has unveiled its surveillance ambitions and IT specialists are finding plenty of jobs in the US. Oh, and Hyundai is moving into  urban air mobility  (flying cars).

The Big Story   exclusive

US-China decoupling is hitting venture capital hard. Chinese VC firms used to make big investments into US start-ups but that is changing fast, according to an exclusive in the Financial Times. Spooked by US national security reviews, Chinese VC investments into the US this year have fallen to $4bn, down from almost $7bn in the same period last year.

Key implications

Cfius, the US review panel on foreign investment, is the main obstacle.The panel is heightening scrutiny over Chinese investments and acquisitions, particularly in  critical technology  areas such as military equipment, semiconductors and a broad category of  dual use  tech that could have both civilian and military applications.Such action   and the fear of it   has clobbered the confidence of Chinese investors eyeing the US. Much of their interest is instead now focused on India and south-east Asia.

Upshot

The pullback in venture capital matches a broader drying-up of Chinese foreign direct investment into the US. Chinese FDI, a category that does not include venture capital, fell to $5.4bn in 2018 from $29b in 2017, according to data from Rhodium Group.

Mercedes  top 10

A round-up of the week s best tech stories from the FT s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.

* A report that the Trump administration was considering a ban onChineselistings on US stock markets spooked companies. The Nikkei Asian Review points outfive thingsto know about this (so far unverified) escalation.

* Huawei managed to get into Oxford. TheChinesecompany found a way to gain access to some of theUK smost promising early stage technology: a stake in the company that commercialises research at the university.

* So much for a Trump administration crackdown on H-1B visas curtailing foreign talent in theUS. Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon have increased the number ofIndianIT specialists they employto levels higher than in the Obama years.

* Undeterred by the WeWork IPO fiasco, SoftBank has acquired a big stake inJapaneserental apartment operator MDI, together with Indian hotel start-up Oyo.

* ByteDance,China sbiggest unlisted private company and the owner of TikTok, isapparently profitable.

* Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick is quietly working on a cloud kitchen company and his plans includeAsia. He has invested inIndia slargest shared-kitchen company, according to aSouth China Morning Post report.

* Thefamily officeof Brexiter James Dyson has relocated toSingaporeand is hiring. That s on top of the2,000 jobsthe British appliance maker, which has moved its office to the Asian city, plans to add insouth-east Asia.

* AChinesecar start-up claims to have found a workaround toUStariffs on Chinese goods by usingartificial intelligence and 3D printing.

* Cue The Jetsons clichs. Hyundai has become the latest company to attempt building aflying car. Or as theSouth Koreancompany prefers to call it:  a division dedicated to urban air mobility .

* I leave you with sobering thoughts from the FT s John Thornhill, who bemoans the blind-faith thinking that technology alone will solve the world s climate change problem.

When sages speak

* OK, so this is not directly tech. But concerns over alleged Chinese espionage in the US is one of the main forces behind US-China tech decoupling so thisreportbyCSIS, the Washington-based think-tank, is in fact relevant. It lists 137 publicly reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the US since 2000.

* Military technology is not really our bag   but given the enormous parade in Beijing this week, we are moving with the zeitgeist. This very finereportby C4ADSgoes into depth on the vexed issue of China s military-civil-fusion programme, which does much to fuel the  dual use  suspicions that underlie our Big Story this week.

Heard by Henny

What will be the takeaways from the implosion of WeWork?Well, one might be that being the largest   and among the highest paying   office space tenant in town might not be such a good idea. Reality is exerting a downdraught on office rental demand in several cities already.

But there is one segment of the real estate market that looks more durable: logistics.  Logistics is our highest conviction global investment theme today,  said Ken Caplan, global co-head of Blackstone real estate. This week Blackstone announced the purchase of another $5.9bn worth of US warehouses from Colony Capital.

And logistics these days are high tech. The warehouses in China of ESR Cayman, an Asia-focused ecommerce and logistics start-up, are a prime example. At one logistics centre in Shanghai, robots moved cartons to trucks and delivery vans in a carefully choreographed dance. The company is hoping all this will parlay into a Hong Kong listing this year to raise between $1bn and $1.5bn, perhaps one of the biggest splashes of the year.

Read the story from Henny Sender, the FT s chief correspondent of international finance, here.

In the spotlight

PayPal became the first foreign company to enter China s huge but fiercely competitive digital payments market, signing this week to acquire a local player called Guofubao or, in English, GoPay. The move allows PayPal to steal a march on Visa and Mastercard, which are among those foreign companies that have been kept waiting by Chinese authorities for licences in spite of changes in 2017 that removed formal obstacles to market access.

Dan Schulman, PayPal s chief executive, pictured above, thinks China s market is big enough to support several participants. Indeed, it is enormous: there areforecastto be 956m active mobile payment users by 2023, with total payments valued at $96.7tn. The downside, though, is that Alibaba s Alipay and Tencent s WeChat Pay already have the market pretty much sewn up.

Smart data

Move over Beijing and London.New Delhi is planning to become one of the world s top surveillance cities. The city government will install 300,000 smart cameras to upgrade its crime-fighting potential.

There s still some catching up to do. According to a survey by consumer site Comparitech, the city has only about 10 CCTV cameras per 1,000 people, compared with 40 in Beijing and 68 in London. But privacy campaigners in India are worried   especially as the country is yet to introduce any personal data privacy laws.

 There s a high chance that the government will be tempted to use the facial recognition data for highly dubious purposes,  says one think-tanker. The FT s Benjamin Parkin in Mumbai has more.

Regulation round-up

There s been a drip, drip, drip of articles on Asian countries considering broader scrutiny of Big Tech.In south-east Asia, lawmakersface challengesprotecting consumers and holding tech companies accountable as the disparate region of 650m leaps online. Just take Singapore s fake news laws, whichcome into force today.

But a more unified approach to regulating Big Tech may be developing. Initiatives include a push from Indonesia to join forces with Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines   together 80 per cent of the region s population   in demanding action from Google, Facebook and others on content regulation and tax policy. Lobby groups are (unsurprisingly) unhappy.More here.

US banks will cut more than 200,000 jobs in the next decade as robots and other technology bring about the "greatest transfer from labour to capital" the industry has seen, a report by analysts at Wells Fargo claims.

Cuts of this magnitude would represent more than 10 per cent of bank jobs and clear the way for a "golden age of banking efficiency", according to Mike Mayo, a Wall Street analyst who led the report.

"It's been a rocky 25-year marriage for banking and technology, but it's finally getting on course," he said.

Individual banks have projected that machines could replace thousands of jobs. Citigroup chief executive Mike Corbat said "tens of thousands" of call centre workers could be replaced.

Former Deutsche Bank boss John Cryan warned in 2017 that as many as half the bank's 97,000-strong workforce could go.

Wells Fargo looked at how artificial intelligence could reduce mortgage processing costs 10 to 20 per cent, while big data would allow "more surgical marketing" and cloud computing could yield significant savings.

The job cuts would be felt most heavily in back offices, branches and call centres, where staff numbers could fall by between 20 and 30 per cent.

The cuts would reverse a largely unbroken trend of net job creation in the US banking industry.

Data from the FDIC show that the industry's collective headcount has only shrunk 16 times since 1935, and never by more than 55,000 in a single year.

Americans Buy Cars With Piles of Debt --- Booming financing, stretched-out loans, are signs of middle-class indebtedness

Walk into an auto dealership these days and you might walk out with a seven-year car loan.

That means monthly payments that last well past when the brake pads give out and potentially beyond when the car gets traded in for a new one. About a third of auto loans for new vehicles taken in the first half of 2019 had terms of longer than six years, according to credit-reporting firm Experian PLC. A decade ago, that number was less than 10%.

Car loans that are increasingly stretched out are a pronounced sign that some American middle class buyers can't afford a middle-class lifestyle.

Incomes have risen at a sluggish pace in the past decade, but car prices have grown rapidly. New technological and safety features, such as larger and more sophisticated multimedia displays, have made even the most basic cars more expensive. U.S. consumers have also veered toward pricier rides such as sport-utility vehicles that tend to dominate auto showrooms. The result is that consumers are seeking bigger loans than ever to purchase a car.

A lending machine has revved up in response, making it possible for more Americans to procure a vehicle by spreading the debt over longer periods. Wall Street investors snap up these loans, which are bundled into bonds. Dealers now make more money on the loans their customers take than on the cars they sell.

For many Americans, the availability of loans with longer terms has created an illusion of affordability. It has helped fuel car purchases that would have been out of reach with three-, five- or even six-year loans.

"People can get into very expensive cars," said Bronson Argyle, a professor at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, whose research focuses on consumer credit. "Households are taking on, on average, more risk."

Deven Jones walked into the Rolling Hills Honda dealership in St. Joseph, Mo., in early 2017 after a salesman emailed him and said he might be able to buy a new car for less than $400 a month.

Mr. Jones, now 22 years old, walked out with a gray Accord sedan with heated leather seats. He also took home a 72-month car loan that cost him and his then-girlfriend more than $500 a month. When they split last year and the monthly payment fell solely to him, it suddenly took up more than a quarter of his take-home pay.

He paid $27,000 for the car, less than the sticker price, but took out a $36,000 loan with an interest rate of 1.9% to cover the purchase price and unpaid debt on two vehicles he bought as a teenager. It was particularly burdensome when combined with his other debt, including credit cards, he said.

Just 18% of U.S. households had enough liquid assets to cover the cost of a new car, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 2016 data from the Fed's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, a proportion that hasn't changed much in recent years.

Even a conservative car loan often won't do it. The median-income U.S. household with a four-year loan, 20% down and a payment under 10% of gross income -- a standard budget -- could afford a car worth $18,390, excluding taxes, according to an analysis by personal-finance website Bankrate.com.

But the size of the average auto loan has grown by about a third over the past decade to $32,119 for a new car, according to Experian. To keep payments manageable, the car industry has taken to adding more months to the end of the loan.

The average loan stretches for roughly 69 months, a record. Some last much longer. In the first half of the year, 1.5% of auto loans for new vehicles had terms of 85 months or longer, according to Experian. Five years ago, these eight- and nine-year loans were practically nonexistent.

As a result, a growing share of car buyers won't pay off the debt before they trade in their cars for new ones, either because the car is in need of repairs or because they want a newer model. A third of new-car buyers who trade in their cars roll debt from old vehicles into their new loans, according to car-shopping site Edmunds. That is up from about a quarter before the financial crisis.

Americans have been borrowing to buy their cars for decades, but auto debt has swelled since the financial crisis. U.S. consumers held a record $1.3 trillion of debt tied to their cars at the end of June, according to the Federal Reserve, up from about $740 billion a decade earlier.

As the global financial system flirted with disaster more than 10 years ago, two of the big three U.S. auto makers received government bailouts and restructured their debt in bankruptcy. The industry emerged into a battered economy when consumers hardly had the cash to go car shopping.

Yet for the auto industry, there was a silver lining: Interest rates had fallen to practically zero. Suddenly, it was much cheaper to finance a car. Loans made to buyers were snapped up by Wall Street investors looking for returns as income from supersafe Treasurys drifted toward zero.

The combination of rock-bottom rates and yield-hungry investors helped bring the U.S. auto industry back to life. By 2015, auto sales had reached records.

Low rates, in effect, served as a bailout for the entire auto industry. Last year, investors bought a record $107 billion of bonds backed by cars, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group. That is the first issuance record since 2005 and nearly triple the amount two decades earlier. The outstanding pile of auto bonds swelled to a record $264 billion.

So far this year, dealerships made an average of $982 per new vehicle on finance and insurance versus $381 on the actual sale, according to J.D. Power, a data and analytics company. A decade earlier, financing brought in $516 per car and the sale made dealers $837.

To see these shifts up close, visit a dealership's finance office. Dealers call it "the box," a reference to the holding cell to which Paul Newman's character was sent in the 1967 movie "Cool Hand Luke." Since most buyers borrow to pay for their cars, it falls on the finance manager to figure out a manageable payment schedule.

The dealership commonly holds on to a portion of the interest rate, typically between 1 and 2 percentage points, or gets a one-time payment from the lender. The dealer also pitches high-margin add-on services, such as extended warranties and insurance for dings and dents, which are rolled into the loan.

When potential buyers enter Petrov Degand's office at Earl Stewart Toyota in North Palm Beach, Fla., he walks them through each add-on, presenting the full menu of options, he said. He has seen finance managers quote a price in which the add-ons are already bundled into the loan amount to increase the bottom line, a tactic known as "packing the payment."

Jose Mercado agreed to buy a series of add-ons, including an extended warranty, for his new RAV4 midway into his fifth hour at a Toyota dealership this spring. Mr. Mercado, 41, who lives in Blackwood, N.J., and works in a chocolate factory, had spent the previous six months reading reviews and figuring out how much he should pay for the car.

He found himself unprepared for the hard sell from the finance manager. The add-ons brought his payment to $448 a month, nearly $100 more than he had expected to pay when he walked in to buy his first new car in 18 years.

"I wish my research would have been deeper to be more ready," he said.

Finance managers at dealerships typically use an electronic portal to hash out the terms of the loans. On the other end are various financial institutions that buy up the loan pretty much as soon as the dealer closes the deal.

Banks and credit unions are big lenders, as are the finance arms of major car makers. Some of these lenders shunned riskier subprime borrowers after the financial crisis, fueling the growth of independent nonbank auto lenders.

Westlake Services LLC is among the biggest. Its owner, billionaire Don Hankey, started lending four decades ago when, as a dealer, he realized subprime buyers needed somewhere to get their financing. Westlake is still focused on these borrowers, but it has pursued more creditworthy customers as it has grown in recent years.

Westlake needs to make sure the monthly payments on its auto loans keep flowing. Late borrowers can expect calls from the company immediately. Roughly 40% of its employees focus exclusively on collecting.

In mid-April, a representative who handles the most-difficult cases called a past-due borrower to iron out payment on a 2018 Toyota RAV4. The borrower had struggled to keep up with a payment of more than $800. The car already had been repossessed from the borrower once.

The Westlake representative switched between English and Spanish. He offered an extension on the March payment, meaning it wouldn't be due until the end of the loan in 2024. But he collected nearly $600 on a partial payment for April over the phone. Borrowers are less likely to resume payments if they stop altogether.

After hanging up, the representative rang a bell at his desk. "35K," he called out, referring to the balance of the loan that was no longer considered seriously delinquent. "It took a while but I got 'em."

Across the industry, delinquencies have trended higher in the past few years, but they haven't surged like mortgage delinquencies did during the financial crisis. Investors have been largely content to buy lenders' auto bonds as they search for returns in a low-rate world. Losses are significantly higher when loan terms lengthen, according to S&P Global Ratings.

Mr. Jones, in Missouri, got his loan from Honda's financing arm, which pools a large portion of its loans into bonds that it sells to investors. A $1.25 billion sale from late 2017 contained more than 7,000 loans tied to 2017 Accords like the one Mr. Jones owns, according to loan-level data.

The investors who hold Mr. Jones's loan are still getting paid because he has remained current. Mr. Jones took on more overtime shifts at the plastic factory where he works as a machine operator. A raise and a bonus helped get him to stable ground. Still, he will be making payments for years to come.

Mr. Jones said he doesn't plan to take out another auto loan soon. "Even just signing the paper, not even driving the car off the lot, suddenly I'm underwater," he said.

Business News: Race Cars Teach Machine Learning  --- Amazon league's mini self-driving vehicles train workers on artificial intelligence

Employees at companies including Morningstar Inc. and Liberty Mutual Group Inc. are learning about advanced artificial-intelligence techniques by programming and racing miniature self-driving cars.

The DeepRacer league, developed by Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services cloud business, is designed to teach a branch of AI known as reinforcement learning. In this type of machine learning, algorithms learn the correct way to perform an action based on trial and error and observations.

The technique is different from a type of AI commonly used in business called supervised learning, in which algorithms have to be fed with labeled training data to learn to recognize images or make predictions. Here, the cars supply their own data: images collected with cameras.

Anyone with an Amazon Web Services account can participate in the league. Teams or individuals can compete online in virtual races or in person at events world-wide.

Teams build and train AI algorithms using Amazon SageMaker software, deploy them to self-driving cars measuring about 10 inches, then race them around a track of roughly 17 feet by 26 feet.

"It's actually having practical applications," said James Rhodes, chief technology officer of investment research firm Morningstar. Thanks to the training, the company expects to have dozens of projects based on reinforcement learning and other machine-learning techniques in deployment by the end of 2020, he said.

Reinforcement learning can also be used to help robots walk faster or to develop security systems that automatically adapt to different environments. It's "a pretty complicated technology and there's a pretty steep learning curve," said Mike Miller, general manager of AI devices at Amazon Web Services.

AWS developed the program to teach software developers about machine learning in a more engaging way than reading scientific articles, Mr. Miller said.

The algorithms are complex because they gather data on their own, instead of being fed millions of images to learn from, said Peter Stone, professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin.

Mr. Stone, who is president of AI software company CogitAI Inc., isn't involved with DeepRacer.

Programmers write code to reward the algorithms when they do something right, such as winning a race or avoiding an obstacle.

In the case of algorithm-powered cars, that could include such tasks as staying close to the centerline on the track, minimizing wide steering angles and turning to avoid barriers and crashes.

At Morningstar, more than 450 software developers, equity analysts and quantitative researchers have formed nearly 100 racing teams in 10 countries since January, when Mr. Rhodes began allowing employees to use the technology.

Morningstar has invested "north of tens of thousands of dollars" on the miniature cars and training software to date, he said. "It's bringing the virtual [world] into the physical space, especially for individuals who are not necessarily computer scientists," he said.

Earlier this year, one of the Morningstar teams came up with an idea for a tool based on reinforcement learning that looks for patterns in regulatory filings.

Liberty Mutual has 270 employees, including software engineers and data scientists, participating in DeepRacer.

"It's a fun way for people to get practical exposure for what are very important algorithms in a safe environment where they're not going to mess up any core business applications," said James McGlennon, the insurer's chief information officer.

VC Daily: WeWork Pulls IPO, Seeks New Funding; Ginkgo-Berkeley Lights Deal; Rapyd Payments Cash

Good day. Has sanity has returned to the IPO market with the falling share prices of Peloton, Uber and Lyft not to mention the pulling of WeWork's IPO?

Not too much has changed if you look at the fundamentals, says Union Square Ventures' Fred Wilson, who pointed out in a blog post that the gross margins of Zoom, Cloudflare and Datadog, which performed well post-IPO, are all 75% or higher, while Uber, Lyft and Peloton have gross margins below 50%. WeWork's gross margins are 20%. Public investors are rationally buying companies that have true software gross margins, he writes.

Also, things may not look as bad if you don't focus on the first day of trading, Redpoint Ventures' Tomasz Tunguz writes. Of 11 recent IPOs, only two companies closed up on their first day of trading and are still trading up: Zoom and Pinterest. But if you look at companies that are trading above their initial IPO prices not their "aggressive" first-day closing prices six are trading up: Zoom, Pinterest, Crowdstrike, Datadog, Dynatrace and PagerDuty. (That still leaves Peloton, Slack, Uber, Lyft and SmileDirectClub trading down.)

Ultimately, Mr. Tunguz writes, the share price drops of these public companies could start to filter down to startup valuations.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Cash crunch. Having decided to shelve its plans for an initial public offering, WeWork's parent company is in early talks to raise money from private investors, The Wall Street Journal's Eliot Brown reported, citing people familiar with those discussions.

* The company had expected a huge infusion of cash in a public offering, but now investors don't foresee an IPO until next year.

* We Co. had $2.5 billion of cash as of June 30. At its current rate of cash burn about $700 million a quarter it would run out of money some time after the first quarter of 2020, according to an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

* For years, We Co. was defined by big spending as it pursued growth. Now, it needs to stop bleeding cash, so it's planning thousands of job cuts, putting businesses up for sale and purging luxuries.

* The business is expected to need lots of cash to build out its offices. We reported spending $1.3 billion in net capital costs in 2018 only a portion of which shows up in the company's official losses because those costs are accounted for over many years.

Cell deal. Synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks Inc. has teamed up with Berkeley Lights Inc., a startup that helps develop, analyze and clone cells for use in biotechnology applications, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports. Flush from a recent $290 million financing round led by T. Rowe Price, Ginkgo says it will spend $150 million to use Berkeley Lights' platform, which allows for rapid analysis and cultivation of cells to develop compounds such as pharmaceuticals and food ingredients.

Payments cash. Rapyd, a London-based startup offering digital payments software, has raised $100 million to expand its services facilitating cross-border payments for businesses, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartebedian reports. Oak HC/FT led the deal, with Tiger Global Management, Coatue Management, General Catalyst and others including payments company Stripe Inc. participating. Rapyd will use the new capital in part to expand its local presence in several markets in the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, Chief Executive Arik Shtilman said.

Crypto securities. The U.S.'s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges have developed a system to rate which digital assets are probably securities that can't be traded on their venues and which likely can, the Journal's Dave Michaels reports. Exchange operators involved with the effort include Coinbase Inc., Kraken, Circle Internet Financial Ltd. and Bittrex Inc. The SEC hasn't endorsed the group's approach and could question any decisions to list tokens for trading.

Mars calling. Elon Musk has stoked excitement about accelerated development of private deep-space vehicles while provoking consternation inside NASA by projecting his proposed megarocket targeting Mars could take humans on an orbital test flight as soon as next year, the Journal's Andy Pasztor reports.

Shipping snafus. Rent the Runway, the clothing rental startup with a $1 billion valuation, has put a freeze on its expansion so it can address logistics problems and shipping delays, the Journal's Sarah Nassauer reports. The New York company will stop enrolling new subscribers and not accept new special-occasion clothing rentals that need to be delivered before Oct. 15, Chief Executive Jennifer Hyman said in an email to customers.

Exits

Vir Biotechnology Inc., backed by ARCH Venture Partners and SoftBank Vision Fund, said it plans to raise about $134 million in its initial public offering by selling 7.1 million shares for an expected price of $20 to $22 a share.

Verizon Communications Inc. acquired software, technology and certain other assets from Jaunt XR for an undisclosed amount. The San Mateo, Calif.-based augmented-reality company was backed by investors including GV, Highland Capital Partners and Redpoint Ventures.

Report says cuts greatest in back offices, branches and call centres

US banks will cut more than 200,000 jobs in the next decade as robots and other technology bring about the greatest transfer from labour to capital  the industry has seen, a report by analysts at Wells Fargo claims.

Cuts of this magnitude would represent more than 10 per cent of totalbank jobs and clear the way for a golden age of banking efficiency , according to Mike Mayo, a veteran Wall Street analyst who led the report. It s been a rocky 25-year marriage for banking and technology but it s finally getting on course,  he said.

Individual banks have predicted that machines could replace thousands of jobs, most notably Citigroup chief executive Mike Corbat, whosaid  tens of thousands  of call centre workers could be replaced, and former Deutsche Bank boss John Cryan who warned in 2017 that as many as half the bank s 97,000-strong workforce could go.

Wells Fargo s team of financial services and technology analysts looked at the impact of technology across the US banking industry. In their 225-page report, they detailed how artificial intelligence could reduce mortgage processing costs by 10 to 20 per cent, while big data would allow more surgical marketing  and cloud computing could yield significant savings.

 Banks spend more on tech than any other industry (c$150 billion a year), and, therefore, better get their money s worth,  the analysts wrote.

The job cuts would be felt most heavily in back offices, branches and call centres where staff numbers could fall by between 20 and 30 per cent, Wells Fargo said. The biggest savings will be at larger banks since technology is a game changer for scale , according to Mr Mayo.

The job cuts would reverse a largely-unbroken trend of net job creation in the US banking industry. Data from the FDIC show that the industry s collective headcount has only shrunk 16 times since 1935 and never by more than 55,000 in a single year.

 They don t have a choice,  said Mr Mayo on whether banks would be prepared to cut so many employees. The banking industry is a slower growing industry than it s been in the past 	. 	. 	. 	Half of the banks  costs are compensation, there aren t many other levers to use.

Corrections & Amplifications

Deven Jones took out a 72-month auto loan in early 2017. An earlier version incorrectly said he took an 84-month loan about three years ago. (Oct. 1, 2019)

Walk into an auto dealership these days and you might walk out with a seven-year car loan.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/auto-lenders-ramp-up-risk-to-win-more-customers-1528639200" and potentially beyond when the car gets traded in for a new one. About a third of auto loans for new vehicles taken in the first half of 2019 had terms of longer than six years, according to credit-reporting firm Experian PLC. A decade ago, that number was less than 10%.

Incomes have risen at a sluggish pace in the past decade, but car prices have grown rapidly. New technological and safety features, such as larger and more sophisticated multimedia displays, have made even the most basic cars more expensive. U.S. consumers have also veered toward pricier rides such as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/minivan-sales-fade-as-families-opt-for-suvs-11564322401". The result is that consumers are seeking bigger loans than ever to purchase a car.

Wall Street investors snap up these loans, which are bundled into bonds. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/add-on-services-emerge-as-car-dealers-profit-generator-11554634800".

For many Americans, the availability of loans with longer terms has created an illusion of affordability. It has helped fuel car purchases that would have been out of reach with three-, five- or even six-year loans.

"People can get into very expensive cars," said Bronson Argyle, a professor at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, whose research focuses on consumer credit. "Households are taking on, on average, more risk."

Deven Jones walked into the Rolling Hills Honda dealership in St. Joseph, Mo., in early 2017 after a salesman emailed him and said he might be able to buy a new car for less than $400 a month.

Mr. Jones, now 22 years old, walked out with a gray Accord sedan with heated leather seats. He also took home a 72-month car loan that cost him and his then-girlfriend more than $500 a month. When they split last year and the monthly payment fell solely to him, it suddenly took up more than a quarter of his take-home pay.

He paid $27,000 for the car, less than the sticker price, but took out a $36,000 loan with an interest rate of 1.9% to cover the purchase price and unpaid debt on two vehicles he bought as a teenager. It was particularly burdensome when combined with his other debt, including credit cards, he said.

Just 18% of U.S. households had enough liquid assets to cover the cost of a new car, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 2016 data from the Fed's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, a proportion that hasn't changed much in recent years.

Even a conservative car loan often won't do it. The median-income U.S. household with a four-year loan, 20% down and a payment under 10% of gross income a standard budget could afford a car worth $18,390, excluding taxes, according to an analysis by personal-finance website Bankrate.com.

But the size of the average auto loan has grown by about a third over the past decade to $32,119 for a new car, according to Experian. To keep payments manageable, the car industry has taken to adding more months to the end of the loan.

The average loan stretches for roughly 69 months, a record. Some last much longer. In the first half of the year, 1.5% of auto loans for new vehicles had terms of 85 months or longer, according to Experian. Five years ago, these eight- and nine-year loans were practically nonexistent.

As a result, a growing share of car buyers won't pay off the debt before they trade in their cars for new ones, either because the car is in need of repairs or because they want a newer model. A third of new-car buyers who trade in their cars roll debt from old vehicles into their new loans, according to car-shopping site Edmunds. That is up from about a quarter before the financial crisis.

Americans have been borrowing to buy their cars for decades, but auto debt has swelled since the financial crisis. U.S. consumers held a record $1.3 trillion of debt tied to their cars at the end of June, according to the Federal Reserve, up from about $740 billion a decade earlier.

As the global financial system flirted with disaster more than 10 years ago, two of the big three U.S. auto makers received government bailouts and restructured their debt in bankruptcy. The industry emerged into a battered economy when consumers hardly had the cash to go car shopping.

Yet for the auto industry, there was a silver lining: Interest rates had fallen to practically zero. Suddenly, it was much cheaper to finance a car. Loans made to buyers were snapped up by Wall Street investors looking for returns as income from supersafe Treasurys drifted toward zero.

The combination of rock-bottom rates and yield-hungry investors helped bring the U.S. auto industry back to life. By 2015, auto sales had reached records.

Low rates, in effect, served as a bailout for the entire auto industry. Last year, investors bought a record $107 billion of bonds backed by cars, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group. That is the first issuance record since 2005 and nearly triple the amount two decades earlier. The outstanding pile of auto bonds swelled to a record $264 billion.

So far this year, dealerships made an average of $982 per new vehicle on finance and insurance versus $381 on the actual sale, according to J.D. Power, a data and analytics company. A decade earlier, financing brought in $516 per car and the sale made dealers $837.

To see these shifts up close, visit a dealership's finance office. Dealers call it "the box," a reference to the holding cell to which Paul Newman's character was sent in the 1967 movie "Cool Hand Luke." Since most buyers borrow to pay for their cars, it falls on the finance manager to figure out a manageable payment schedule.

The dealership commonly holds on to a portion of the interest rate, typically between 1 and 2 percentage points, or gets a one-time payment from the lender. The dealer also pitches high-margin add-on services, such as extended warranties and insurance for dings and dents, which are rolled into the loan.

When potential buyers enter Petrov Degand's office at Earl Stewart Toyota in North Palm Beach, Fla., he walks them through each add-on, presenting the full menu of options, he said. He has seen finance managers quote a price in which the add-ons are already bundled into the loan amount to increase the bottom line, a tactic known as "packing the payment."

Jose Mercado agreed to buy a series of add-ons, including an extended warranty, for his new RAV4 midway into his fifth hour at a Toyota dealership this spring. Mr. Mercado, 41, who lives in Blackwood, N.J., and works in a chocolate factory, had spent the previous six months reading reviews and figuring out how much he should pay for the car.

He found himself unprepared for the hard sell from the finance manager. The add-ons brought his payment to $448 a month, nearly $100 more than he had expected to pay when he walked in to buy his first new car in 18 years.

"I wish my research would have been deeper to be more ready," he said.

Finance managers at dealerships typically use an electronic portal to hash out the terms of the loans. On the other end are various financial institutions that buy up the loan pretty much as soon as the dealer closes the deal.

Banks and credit unions are big lenders, as are the finance arms of major car makers. Some of these lenders shunned riskier subprime borrowers after the financial crisis, fueling the growth of independent nonbank auto lenders.

Westlake Services LLC is among the biggest. Its owner, billionaire Don Hankey, started lending four decades ago when, as a dealer, he realized subprime buyers needed somewhere to get their financing. Westlake is still focused on these borrowers, but it has pursued more creditworthy customers as it has grown in recent years.

Much like a dealership, the company is obsessed with results. An automated system sends emails to employees with an image of a winking robot when they are late to work, unproductive or exceed expectations. Workers get monthly bonuses based on how they stack up against their goals. Screens around the office display auto loan applications as they come in.

Westlake needs to make sure the monthly payments on its auto loans keep flowing. Late borrowers can expect calls from the company immediately. Roughly 40% of its employees focus exclusively on collecting.

In mid-April, a representative who handles the most-difficult cases called a past-due borrower to iron out payment on a 2018 Toyota RAV4. The borrower had struggled to keep up with a payment of more than $800. The car already had been repossessed from the borrower once.

The Westlake representative switched between English and Spanish. He offered an extension on the March payment, meaning it wouldn't be due until the end of the loan in 2024. But he collected nearly $600 on a partial payment for April over the phone. Borrowers are less likely to resume payments if they stop altogether.

After hanging up, the representative rang a bell at his desk. "35K," he called out, referring to the balance of the loan that was no longer considered seriously delinquent. "It took a while but I got 'em."

Across the industry, delinquencies have trended higher in the past few years, but they haven't surged like mortgage delinquencies did during the financial crisis. Investors have been largely content to buy lenders' auto bonds as they search for returns in a low-rate world. Losses are significantly higher when loan terms lengthen, according to S&P Global Ratings.

Mr. Jones, in Missouri, got his loan from Honda's financing arm, which pools a large portion of its loans into bonds that it sells to investors. A $1.25 billion sale from late 2017 contained more than 7,000 loans tied to 2017 Accords like the one Mr. Jones owns, according to loan-level data.

The investors who hold Mr. Jones's loan are still getting paid because he has remained current. Mr. Jones took on more overtime shifts at the plastic factory where he works as a machine operator. A raise and a bonus helped get him to stable ground. Still, he will be making payments for years to come.

Mr. Jones said he doesn't plan to take out another auto loan soon. "Even just signing the paper, not even driving the car off the lot, suddenly I'm underwater," he said.

Markets Review & Outlook: A Quarterly Analysis --- Options Funds Attract Investors

Options trading is flourishing as investors struggle to make sense of a tumultuous period in the markets and the economy.

Assets under management for mutual and exchange-traded funds that use options strategies have jumped 24% this year -- on track for one of the biggest advances of the past decade, according to Morningstar data. They hit a record $22 billion at the end of August.

The strategies range in styles and levels of risk. Often, they seek to generate additional income by regularly selling options contracts. Other times, they use options in an attempt to protect against potential stock losses, a practice sometimes likened to buying insurance.

There are risks, and options can be tricky to use if not managed properly. Aggressive options selling can boomerang if market volatility picks up, as some investors fear it could through the end of the year.

"Options selling is not a panacea and without proper risk controls investors can face significant losses," says Kurt Nye, managing director at MAI Capital Management, which oversees an options-selling strategy. Still, he says, "people are looking to expand beyond traditional asset classes due to high valuations and low yields."

Call options give investors the right to buy shares at a specific price by a stated time, while puts confer the right to sell. An investor might buy a call option on Apple Inc. to profit from an expected climb in the iPhone maker's shares, or buy a put option to shield against a possible decline.

In recent years, selling options has grown more popular among retail and institutional investors who have been drawn to the income at a time of low interest rates. The tactic involves selling calls and puts to collect the upfront premium while hoping the contracts aren't exercised.

"Driving down yields makes it more difficult for investors to earn a competitive return," said Tom Lee, managing director of investment strategy and research at Parametric Portfolio Associates. "They are willing to look at alternative strategies to achieve their return objectives."

Parametric's fund holds stocks including Microsoft Corp. and Visa Inc. while selling call and put options to generate returns on top of the equity portfolio. It has roughly tripled its assets under management since 2017, Morningstar data show. Mr. Lee says his strategy doesn't entail using leverage and employs a safe strategy for selling options.

Some of the biggest beneficiaries of the increased interest in options strategies have been exchange-traded funds. More than $1.7 billion in fund flows has gone to ETFs using options this year, FactSet data through Sept. 26 show.

One of the strategies in Morningstar's options category, the LJM Preservation and Growth fund, gathered more than $800 million in assets through the end of 2017 before facing severe losses during a bout of volatility in markets in 2018.

Some of these funds promise to let investors participate in some of the S&P 500's gains, while protecting them from potential losses in the stock index simultaneously. This protection can be costly through the options market and the ETFs sometimes have higher fees as a result, said Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research and analytics at FactSet.

"The appeal of a product like this -- especially in a volatile market like this -- is the downside protection that investors are getting," said Ms. Kashner. "The real question is: at what price?"

New pattern for insurtech bets

Despite the cautious arrroach by entrepreneurs and investors, investment levels are growing

Around 7,000 people gathered in Las Vegas last week for the annualInsureTech Connectshow to hear about what s in the pipeline, gossip with old friends, and perhaps wonder if the slot machines are an easier way of making money than investing in insurance start-ups.

Insurtech is not a new phenomenon   for years people have been enthusing about the potential for big data, artificial intelligence and blockchain to revolutionise the centuries-old industry.

But this year there was a more cautious tone at the event.  Mirror mirror on the wall 	. 	. 	. 	what's the true impact of it all?  was the theme of one of the panels.

 There s been a stepping back from the hype,  says Sam Friedman, insurance research leader at Deloitte.  People are asking how things are panning out and who is likely to succeed. That sort of circumspection wasn t here a few years ago. 

It is not just conference panels that are beginning to sound more cautious. Entrepreneurs and investors are also treading more warily.

According toDeloitte, there were around 200 insurtech start-up launches in 2015 and 2016. That almost halved in 2017 and dropped to just 12 last year. Deloitte found just one launch in the first half of this year.

Despite that, investment levels are growing. Around $2.6bn was invested in insurtechs last year, and in the first half of this year alone $2.2bn was put in.

But much of that money is going in bigger amounts to relatively mature companies. This year alone, Lemonade has raised $300m,Collective Healthhas raised $205m and India sPolicybazaarhas raised $152m, all in late stage funding rounds.

Investors are gearing up for more of the same. Axa Venture Partners, which is mostly funded by the French insurance group, last week launched a new late-stage investment fund to put money into more established tech companies (although its remit stretches far beyond insurance).

 Four or five years ago it would have been too early but the European market is maturing,  says Franois Robinet, managing partner of Axa Venture Partners.  There is a need for late growth funding. 

Mr Robinet is hoping to raise  ¬1bn for the fund, a quarter of which has been committed by Axa.  Late stage companies [ &] are massively derisked compared to early stage companies but they still have good growth potential,  he argues.  The more late stage you are, the more data you have. You can see how the business is going. 

Big insurance companies themselves are also taking a more sober look at their tech investments, and going for scale over hope.

In the UK, new Aviva chief executive Maurice Tulloch plans to keep on investing in technology, but has promised that in future digital investments will have  an enhanced focus on commercial outcomes .

And in the US, Prudential Financial has just spent $2.3bn on Assurance IQ, a three year-old company that aims to make it easier for people to buy health insurance and other financial products.

In itspress release, Prudential was quick to boast that the deal would be  accretive to earnings per share and return on equity in year one . That s not a phrase usually used when insurers talk about their tech investments.

So what of the start-ups, and the entrepreneurs with exciting new ideas?

 We anticipate that for the rest of this year and next year you ll see a continuation of the focus on companies that show the most promise,  says Mr Friedman.  Start-ups won t stop [ 	. 	. 	.] but I don t know if we ll see hundreds of start-ups again like we have in the past.

Managing ESG Risks Involves Looking Beyond the Quarter, Zurich CEO Says; Mario Greco stresses the importance of having a long-term viewpoint when dealing with environmental, social and governance issues

After taking the helm of Zurich Insurance Group AG three years ago, Mario Greco put in place a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/zurich-insurance-streamlines-global-operations-1465549534", cutting costs and realigning business units.

An important, though less visible, part of his strategy has involved focusing on nonfinancial factors including environmental sustainability and employee morale that Mr. Greco says are just as critical to the Swiss insurance giant's long-term health.

Zurich in June said it would stop doing business with companies that generate a large portion of their revenue from fossil fuels, warning it would walk away from companies that don't have plans to reduce their exposure.

"I will not insure them, and I will not invest in their bonds, in their equities, their financial instruments," Mr. Greco said. He said Zurich has lost some business because of the decision.

In the months ahead, Zurich will launch a climate-risk advisory service for clients, it said this week.

Mr. Greco discussed his approach to managing environmental, social and governance risks in a recent interview in New York. Here is an edited and condensed transcript.

Q: Why are companies so far behind in their planning for climate-related risks?

It isn't a good explanation, but it's real: Every organization is very slow to adapt. Organizations are built to continue prolonging their reality forever &The consequences? It's not just the risk management; it's what you do after that. You do risk management. You find out that something you do is not positive. You have to rethink what to do. You have to rethink the way your people work. You have to rethink your targets, and that's tough.

Q: How are companies tracking ESG metrics internally? And are they giving Zurich a look at their climate-risk exposures?

There are many metrics these days, and there are lots of indexes by [ESG] ratings agencies. The problem is they are different and also they are aggregated. We need to have disaggregated metrics, and especially for [tracking our environmental] commitments.

Q: You put in place a new financial strategy when you joined the company. How about on the culture side? What kinds of changes have you made?

I'm trying to move the company toward a long-term vision. One mistake which has been made, I believe, in the Western world is to have an excessive short-term orientation in running the business and reporting on the businesses.

We eliminated quarterly reports. Now we only report twice a year.

Q: What has changed as a result?

I think the frenzy of what's going to be next week's result has gone away, internally and externally. As a philosophy, I think if we all switch ourselves to running businesses for longer periods of time, we will start caring for things that we haven't been caring for that much. Employee engagement short term, it doesn't really matter; a quarterly target is a financial issue. If I have a five-year, 10-year vision, employee engagement is fundamental.

Q: What kinds of investments have you made in your employees?

Many. We developed training for people. We redefined career progression, making sure people understand what the company is doing for them over a long period of time, making sure they understand there will be a reward for them over time personally by being with the company. We redefined the purpose of the company.

Q: What are some examples?

We are training people on [artificial intelligence]. We are training people on cybercrime, on everything which is innovative. But the way we want to do this is, I don't train you. I give you the opportunity to get the training. I pay for you, but you need to be the one willing to train yourself.

Q: Are you giving your employees a stipend?

Starting next year we want to develop this into giving a kind of training wallet to people, saying, "That's the opportunity. Train yourself if you believe this is important for you."

Q: You talk a lot about creating long-term value. Would you be willing to take a short-term hit to profits in the name of investing in your labor force?

In a sense I think the question is not legitimate &If you want to maximize the short-term profits of an organization, you take financial actions. You act on some financial levers, and you achieve it. If you want to achieve long-term profits for the organization, you have to invest in new developments and machinery. You have to invest in skills.

 &I run a company for profits, but my profits should be sustainable over a long time. This is what I'm trying to do, and this is the culture I'm trying to bring in the organization. If you want to do that, then naturally you start thinking about these other things. You start thinking about the communities. You start thinking about the employee satisfaction. You start thinking about the customer satisfaction. You start thinking about sustainability.

Good day. Another highly valued, SoftBank-backed real-estate startup is under increased scrutiny. This time it isn't WeWork, but Compass, the New York-based brokerage valued at more than $6.4 billion.

Compass Chief Operating Officer Maelle Gavet announced her departure Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported, while the company's financial, marketing and technology chiefs also have left in the past 18 months.

Like WeWork in office space, Compass has tried to make the case that it is a tech company, not just a real-estate broker. There were internal disagreements between one side wanting to invest in technology and the other wanting to invest in the traditional brokerage business, the Journal reported.

The scrutiny on Compass, which WSJ Pro previously covered, is likely to only increase with the issues WeWork has faced.

And now on to the news...

Good day. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said the Federal Reserve could be done with rate cuts this year, the dominance of big banks in the short-term lending market is posing a challenge for the Fed, and Germany's Sabine Lautenschlger is leaving the European Central Bank amid divisions over the bank's expansionary monetary policy.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Top News

Fed's Evans Doesn't Anticipate Another Rate Cut for 2019

Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said he "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-s-evans-doesn-t-anticipate-another-rate-cut-for-2019-11569430349?mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" more interest-rate cuts this year but was open to the possibility they might be needed. "I think we're in a good place in terms of the rate setting," Mr. Evans told reporters after a speech in Lake Forest, Ill. But he added, "I'm open-minded to additional action if that's how the discussion goes &I'm sympathetic" to more rate cuts.

Fed's Kaplan: Odds of Recession in Next 12 Months  Relatively Low'

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said while U.S. economic growth is slowing, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dallas-feds-kaplan-odds-of-u-s-recession-in-next-12-months-relatively-low-11569458732?mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" in the next 12 months are low, and he's comfortable with the current level of interest rates. "At 1.75% to 2%, where are we? I'd say we're on the margins accommodative," Mr., Kaplan said at a Dallas Business Club event. "And I'm fine with that, I think it's appropriate."

Germany's Lautenschlger Resigns From ECB Board

The most senior German official at the European Central Bank unexpectedly quit more than two years before the end of her term amid a conflict over a move to restart the bank's giant bond-buying program. Sabine Lautenschlger, who sits on the bank's six-member executive board in Frankfurt, will leave on Oct. 31, the ECB said.

Big Banks Loom Over Fed Repo Efforts

The dominance of big firms trading in the overnight market for cash loans is hampering Federal Reserve efforts to calm short-term funding markets. Activity in the market for repurchase agreements, or repos has increasingly concentrated at large banks. When they hoard reserves, it can drive borrowing costs higher for smaller firms, according to a Fed study published last year. That is one challenge confronting Fed officials as they try to get funds flowing following last week's surge in overnight interest rates.

Timiraos's Take: Fed Divide Is Real, but Powell Has the Votes

By Nick Timiraos

Comments from Fed officials this week, together with their interest-rate projections in last week's "dot plot," illustrate a very real divide among the central bank's policy makers over whether to continue cutting interest rates.

What sometimes gets lost in this picture: There is every indication that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, despite these divides, can get whatever policy outcome he wants right now.

Other Developments Around the World

Capital Account: Banks Are Safer, Markets More Brittle After Reforms

"In the decade since the global financial crisis the U.S. financial system in many ways is much safer, with banks far less likely to fail or need a taxpayer bailout," WSJ's Greg Ip writes. "Yet in other ways it is also more brittle, as the channels that carry cash and securities between investors, banks and foreigners repeatedly clog in the face of stresses they once easily absorbed. The latest example is last week's spike in interest rates on so-called repo loans, which are critical to the functioning of Wall Street."

Brainard Echoes Powell on Repo Market Turmoil

Recent troubles in the repo market suggest the Fed should consider allowing reserves to grow by resuming small purchases of Treasury securities, Fed governor Lael Brainard said, echoing recent remarks by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. "Going forward, it does pose questions about whether reserves in the system do need to be allowed to grow again...to make sure that we don't see this kind of volatility," Ms. Brainard said before a House panel.

Tracking the Labor Market With  Big Data'

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' measurement of payroll employment growth the Current Employment Statistics survey is widely considered to be a reliable business cycle indicator, but has its measurement shortcomings, write Tomaz Cajner, Leland Crane, Ryan Decker, Adrian Hamins-Puertolas and Christopher Kurz for the Federal Reserve's FEDS Notes. "While the CES survey is one of the most carefully conducted measures of labor market activity and uses an extremely large sample, it is still subject to significant sampling error and nonsampling errors," the authors write. "In principle, one could improve the reliability of CES numbers by increasing the sample size as the sampling variance declines in proportion with the sample size." Or as an alternative, "complementary data from private payroll providers can lead to more accurate, timely, and detailed information on the labor market."

Commentary

Japan's Shinzo Abe Aims an Arrow at His Own Foot

Any hope the Japanese government might abandon its sales-tax increase is now gone, writes Mike Bird in a Heard on the Street column. "The increase marks a doleful milestone in Shinzo Abe's seven-year tenure as prime minister, with two of the three "arrows" of Abenomics bold monetary stimulus and flexible fiscal policy clearly falling short of their targets," he writes. On Oct. 1, the sales tax will rise to 10% from 8%. Mr. Bird feels there is no need to raise the sales tax. Japan's main economic challenge is weak demand, not the need to finance government spending.

Basis Points

* President Trump and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a trade-enhancement agreement that will lower agricultural tariffs in Japan, industrial tariffs in the U.S. and set new rules for digital trade between the world's first- and third-largest economies.

* President Trump cast doubt on getting a congressional vote on his reworked trade deal with Mexico and Canada, citing Democrats' push for impeachment.

* Many U.S. manufacturers' ups and downs have had little to do with President Trump.

* The trade war and bad weather are conspiring to create enormous challenges for U.S. farmers.

* Argentina is repeating a pattern that has dogged Latin America's third-biggest economy for over 70 years: It is running out of hard currency while grappling with high inflation and economic contraction.

* The attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities delivered a shock to the kingdom at a moment of economic fragility, with its attempts to jump-start non-oil industries struggling and foreign investment down.

World
Bank of Mexico Lowers Interest Rates Again; Move comes on heels of Fed easing, slowing inflation

MEXICO CITY The Bank of Mexico cut interest rates for a second consecutive month after inflation slowed to its 3% target amid economic stagnation.

A majority of the central bank's board of governors voted Thursday to lower the overnight interest-rate target to 7.75% from 8%. Two of the five board members voted to cut the rate by a half-percentage point to 7.5%.

"The reduction of headline inflation, the ample slack in the economy, and the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves" were the main reasons for the decision, the bank said in a statement.

It cited the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-cuts-rates-by-quarter-point-but-faces-growing-split-11568830081" and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-launches-major-stimulus-package-cuts-key-rate-11568289016", as well as a decline in yields on Mexican government debt.

Mexico's inflation rate fell to 2.99% in mid-September from 3.16% at the end of August, hitting the central bank's target for the first time in three years. Core inflation, excluding energy and agricultural products, held around 3.8%.

When the central bank "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-mexico-cuts-interest-rates-as-economy-struggles-11565894531", four members voted for the cut and one voted to stay on hold.

While Thursday's vote suggests a shift toward a much more accommodative bias, "https://www.banxico.org.mx/publications-and-press/announcements-of-monetary-policy-decisions/ and doesn't reflect that, said Alonso Cervera, chief Latin America economist at Credit Suisse.

"When you read the statement, you can't tell those differences in the discussion, so I think the minutes will be particularly important," he said. The central bank publishes the minutes two weeks after the meeting.

While inflation has declined faster than expected, the economy continues to struggle.

Gross domestic product contracted in the first quarter and was flat in the second. The third quarter also got off to a weak start, with economic activity slipping 0.1% in July from June amid declines in industrial output and services.

The central bank said the economy is expected to show a slight recovery in the rest of the year, although growth risks remain on the downside.

The impact of lower interest rates on the economy, while hard to gauge, should be positive by lowering borrowing costs and possibly supporting exports if the peso weakens somewhat, Mr. Cervera said.

The central bank had lifted the overnight rate to a 10-year high of 8.25% in response to inflation, which reached 6.8% in 2017. "Now with inflation at 3%, it's only normal to expect a much lower overnight rate," Mr. Cervera added.

The peso was little changed in the wake of the central-bank decision, trading around 19.64 to the U.S. dollar.

The persistence of core inflation above target justifies the central bank's caution in lowering interest rates gradually, said Alfredo Coutio, director for Latin America at Moody's Analytics.

"With the Fed's recent move, the rate differential widened for Mexico, thus making domestic credit conditions more expensive for national borrowers," he added.

Corporate Boards Face Challenges in Overseeing AI; Hiring bias, worker displacement and deepfakes are among the issues vexing company directors

WASHINGTON Corporate directors say they are searching for better ways to oversee their companies' expanding artificial-intelligence strategies.

AI raises a number of critical boardroom issues, such as bias in hiring, worker displacement through automation, and "deepfake" videos or audio damaging a company's brand, speakers and attendees said at a meeting of the National Association of Corporate Directors this week.

Boards are struggling to come up with response plans to these and other problems, participants said, offering suggestions on how to do better.

Directors must ask probing questions about the data used to build AI programs, even though doing so might strike some senior leaders as invasive, said Christa Steele, who serves on four boards, including those of OFG Bancorp in Puerto Rico and Recology, a waste-management company in San Francisco.

Board members' role is to guide and oversee, not manage operations, she noted. Yet to appropriately assess the risks of potentially biased data or wild algorithms, she said in an interview, boards need more transparency into corporate operations.

"AI innovation requires the board to understand what to do to surveil risk inside the company," she said. "We on the board have to figure out what all this means."

Artificial intelligence can review a flood of job candidate rsums, for example, but reliance on algorithms can lead companies astray, said Ifeoma Ajunwa, assistant professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University.

Algorithms programmed to eliminate candidates due to a lack of skills or experience, for instance, can filter out potential superstars if humans aren't working with the AI system, she said, speaking at the conference.

"No data analytics could have predicted James Brown, born into deep poverty in the South, would become a multimillionaire," she said.

The prospect of AI taking over jobs also worries directors. An estimated 120 million workers will need to be retrained as AI advances in the next three years, according to "https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-09-06-IBM-Study-The-Skills-Gap-is-Not-a-Myth-But-Can-Be-Addressed-with-Real-Solutions" from International Business Machines Corp. Although some studies show that AI will eventually create more jobs than it kills, the workforce tumult until then is a serious board concern, Paul Daugherty, chief technology and innovation officer at Accenture PLC, said on stage at the conference.

In Mr. Daugherty's research into 1,500 organizations, 75% said they don't have the right skills to take advantage of AI and other new technology, but just 3% said they are retraining people, he said.

"They think it's someone else's job, like the government, to retrain or they don't know what to retrain them in," he said.

AI can also be used to attack companies, Robert Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas, warned in a presentation at the conference.

By using AI to create simulated video or audio, called deepfakes, attackers could show a company's products causing harm or executives doing or saying things they never did, said Mr. Chesney, who focuses on international security issues.

Such false depictions could be deployed to try to damage a company's reputation, stock price and ability to compete. Rivalries between executives or personal feuds outside work also could spur these attacks, he said. "The company is collateral damage."

Capital Account: Banks Safer, Markets More Frail From Reforms

In the decade since the global financial crisis, the U.S. financial system in many ways is much safer, with banks far less likely to fail or need a taxpayer bailout.

Yet in other ways it is also more brittle, as the channels that carry cash and securities between investors, banks and foreigners repeatedly clog in the face of stresses they once easily absorbed.

The latest example is last week's sharp rise in interest rates on so-called repo loans, which are critical to the functioning of Wall Street. It follows "flash crashes" in Treasury bonds, foreign currencies and blue-chip stocks, and spikes in stock-market volatility.

None has yet threatened the broader economy or markets. Yet a crisis or shock originating in the real economy could be amplified by a dysfunctional financial system.

The system almost collapsed in 2008 because banks and other financial institutions had too little capital, such as shareholder equity, to absorb losses on bad mortgages and too little liquidity -- that is, cash on hand -- when skittish lenders yanked their funds. Only public bailouts and central-bank loans prevented a chain reaction of bank failures. The U.S. Dodd-Frank financial law and the international Basel III rules sought to avoid a repeat by holding big institutions to much more stringent, and exacting, standards of liquidity, capital and leverage (the amount of debt per dollar of equity).

Yet Karen Petrou, head of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory advisory firm, says it is a fallacy to believe that "safer banks means safer markets." As intermediaries, banks buy when others want to sell, lend when others want to borrow, and vice versa. If banks become safer by retreating from a market, less-regulated players will move in and the market becomes more dangerous, she said.

The $2 trillion repo market is vital to Wall Street and, indirectly, the U.S. Treasury. Hedge funds and dealers routinely finance purchases of bonds with short-term "repo" loans. In recent weeks, though, money-market funds that typically extend those loans couldn't because their corporate clients were withdrawing cash to pay taxes. That helped drive repo loan rates to nearly 10%.

Banks should have stepped in. After all, they have $1.4 trillion of reserves on deposit at the Fed earning just 2.1% (1.8% after Wednesday's interest-rate cut), a consequence of the Fed's earlier efforts to stimulate the economy by buying bonds with newly created reserves.

But "the arbitrage you thought should have showed up last week didn't," said Alex Roever, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

A key constraint: Eight of the biggest U.S. banks are designated as "global systemically important" and face stiffened capital requirements that penalize them for adding new loans, even short-term repo loans backed by Treasurys.

"It makes them less able to respond to asset-price movements as a buffer against big swings in supply and demand," said Bill Nelson, economist at the Bank Policy Institute, which represents banks.

Second, banks didn't want to be left short of cash for their own needs during the day. In theory, they can make up the shortfall by borrowing from the Fed's discount window. But since the crisis, discount-window borrowing has been frowned upon by regulators and investors as evidence of poor management. Bankers are "under strict instructions to never end up at the discount window," Mr. Nelson said.

Other market ructions have also been blamed on regulatory constraints. In a report this spring, the International Monetary Fund attributed a growing incidence of "flash crashes," such as in the Japanese yen in January, U.S. stock futures last December and U.S. Treasurys in June 2018 in part to banks dialing back intermediation in response to regulations.

Big U.S., European and Japanese banks shrunk their trading portfolios between 2012 and 2017.

Nonregulatory factors are also at work. Algorithmic trading firms have taken a growing share of securities trading and are less regulated than banks. The U.S. Treasury is selling large amounts of debt while the low level of bond yields relative to repo rates makes owning them less profitable for dealers.

Some analysts blamed last week's turmoil on the central bank allowing bank reserves to shrink as its bondholdings dwindled. But more reserves won't help if regulations keep them walled off from where the money is needed. The Fed can, and did, directly address the repo market's pressures by lending dealers as much as $75 billion through open-market operations. It is also weighing creating a permanent facility to offer such repo loans on demand.

"This may make the market safer, but only because it makes the Fed still more indispensable and market discipline even less relevant," Ms. Petrou says. Ironically, that is the opposite of what postcrisis rules changes intended.

Cyber Daily: Boards Brush Up on Cybersecurity; A War Over 5G; Google Gets a Privacy Win in Europe

Good day. Corporate boards have become more engaged and informed on cybersecurity risks and decisions in recent years. The next step: asking the right questions and verifying what they hear from senior executives. Corporate directors can show they take cybersecurity seriously by quizzing security teams and business-unit executives, WSJ Pro's Kim S. Nash reports.

Also today: Tom Ridge, the country's first Homeland Security secretary, said the U.S. should accelerate the development of 5G technology through Defense Department spending; the European Union's top court gave Google a victory over the right to be forgotten; and a Russian man admitted he took part in a hack on JPMorgan Chase & Co. that compromised 83 million customer accounts.

Sharp Questions Can Help Boards Oversee Cybersecurity

By Kim S. Nash

WASHINGTON Corporate directors say they are more informed about cybersecurity risks than they were a few years ago but they might not be taking the right steps to verify what they hear from senior executives, according to governance experts.

Board members often fail to ask specific questions of management and stop short of demanding metrics to measure the effectiveness of cybersecurity efforts, speakers and attendees said Tuesday at a meeting of the National Association of Corporate Directors. Protecting the company, they said, is the job of all executives and directors, and not limited to chief information security officers.

"There's a lot of patting ourselves on our backs that we've gotten this far," said Valerie Abend, a managing director at Accenture PLC's security division, speaking on a panel. "If you think the CISO alone is going to protect our organization, you're mistaken."

New business models calling for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence introduce new risks that directors must understand, Abhi Shah, vice chairman of legal consulting firm Morae Global Corp., said in an interview.

Supermarket chains entering e-commerce to compete with Amazon, for example, have to protect online payment systems and data collected from shoppers, he said. "This has a domino effect in making cyber more important for the company," he said, adding that boards should make cybersecurity part of every strategy discussion.

David Estlick, chief information security officer at Starbucks Corp., urged directors to hold accountable not only the security team but business-unit executives as well. Quizzing them, he said on a panel, shows that the board takes cybersecurity seriously and it can change a company's culture quickly.

Mr. Estlick, who has led Starbucks's security for more than nine years, said the job of a new CISO often is to correct technology or staffing problems within a company's cybersecurity program. As fixes take hold, he said, the next step is to align security with the company's business strategy, which might mean pointing out cybersecurity concerns in new business ideas. "There's a lot of friction in those areas as business demands more from the cyber leader," he said. "Start asking more prolifically through the business their understanding of security."

To vet the information that boards receive from talking to company executives, hire an outside firm to conduct penetration tests, Ms. Abend advised. These "red-team exercises" can uncover security holes in company systems documented in a report directly to the board. "It's a good way to see if your interviews match up," she said.

Pro Tips

What board members should ask as they oversee a company's cybersecurity work:

1. When the company enters into a new business or market, new security skills are often required, said Derek Vadala, chief executive of the cyber assessments unit of ratings firm Moody's Corp. Ask how the cybersecurity organization is hiring to support the move. Related: What's the aggregate tenure of staff with that specific cyber experience?

2. Whether a CISO reports to a chief information officer or another leader, conflicts of interest can arise, especially after a security incident. A CIO, for example, might play down a breach so as not to derail a new technology project. No single reporting structure works for all companies. Instead of prescribing one, ask the teams to document how they manage conflicts of interest, Accenture's Valerie Abend said.

3. Understand that cybersecurity guidance from regulators or other bodies can't account for the nuances of a company's business strategy, Ms. Abend said. Directors shouldn't rely on such frameworks, she said. Instead, ask how cyber processes must change during a merger or acquisition, or the introduction of a new product.

Tom Ridge: 'Digital War Going On' Over 5G

By Adam Janofsky

The Defense Department should play a greater role in fueling 5G investment to prevent the U.S. from falling further behind China in rapidly rolling out the wireless technology, said Tom Ridge, the country's first Homeland Security secretary.

On a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Mr. Ridge and other former government officials discussed cybersecurity threats posed by China's involvement in 5G rollouts across the globe. That threat should be addressed by both slowing down Chinese telecommunications-equipment companies, such as Huawei Technologies Co., and also accelerating alternatives from Western firms, they said.

The U.S. has pressed allies to limit using Huawei gear in 5G rollouts. But countries including the Philippines, Germany and the U.K. have resisted pressure from Washington, with some arguing that Huawei offers better products than rivals at lower prices.

Mr. Ridge, a Republican who served as Homeland Security secretary from 2003 to 2005 under President George W. Bush and who earlier was Pennsylvania's governor, said the U.S. should invest in 5G through the Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, and other government organizations.

"This is a massive, massive security threat," said Mr. Ridge, founder and chairman of cybersecurity firm Ridge Global LLC. "There's an undeclared digital war going on."

New 5G technology, expected to be 100 times as fast as today's networks, could pave the way for new innovations in autonomous vehicles, remote surgery and other fields.

Last week, Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) said during a cybersecurity conference that the U.S. government should support one or more 5G vendors to help develop a more appealing alternative to Huawei's equipment.

Asked by WSJ Pro Cybersecurity if he agreed with Sen. Warner's assessment, Mr. Ridge said: "Yes, absolutely yes. We don't have a moment to lose."

U.S. officials say the nation will maintain its lead in 5G. "Beijing can snap its fingers and put up untold cellular towers overnight, but in the long run, I have more faith in the U.S. system," Commissioner Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission's point person on wireless infrastructure, told the Journal earlier this year.

Chris Cummiskey, a senior fellow at Virginia Tech's Hume Center for National Security and Technology, said on Tuesday's call that the U.S. is lagging behind China on 5G and that government support is needed to develop equipment that could rival Huawei's on price and quality.

"Bringing government and private industry together in partnership is the best way to [catch up with China on 5G]," said Mr. Cummiskey, who served as a senior Homeland Security official under President Obama. "We have a lot of ground to cover to make up the disadvantage we're at presently."

Google scores victory over right to be forgotten. The European Union's top court ruled that Google doesn't have to apply the "right to be forgotten" to versions of its search engine accessed outside the EU's borders, The Wall Street Journal reports. The EU principle was established in 2014, and allows people to request that search engines remove links that include personal information from searches for their names. The decision is a victory for Google, which has been fighting an order from France's privacy regulator over the last four years to apply the right globally.

Russian man admits to JPMorgan hack. A Russian hacker admitted he took part in a hacking operation that compromised the information of 83 million JPMorgan Chase & Co. customers, the New York Times reports. Andrei Tyurin pleaded guilty to six felony counts, including wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and faces a term of up to life in prison. Mr. Tyurin is the first person to be convicted in the case; charges against three other men are pending.

Mobile malware targeted Tibetans as well as Uighurs. Cybersecurity researchers from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab say Tibetan officials and activists were targeted with malicious web links over Facebook Inc.'s messaging service WhatsApp, TechCrunch reports. When opened, the links could give hackers full access to the victim's phone and allow them to install spyware and steal sensitive data. The exploits are technically similar to a recent campaign targeting Uighur Muslims in China.

Russian hacker group started new phishing campaign using Dropbox. The Zebrocry hacker group is targeting embassies and foreign ministries in Eastern European and Central Asian countries with phishing emails that use Dropbox Inc. to host malware, Bleeping Computer reports. Zebrocry is connected the Russian-language Fancy Bear hacker group. Researchers from cybersecurity firm ESET said it is unusual for hackers to use Dropbox because security tools are likely to detect it.

Deutsche chief Christian Sewing warns  sky has darkened  for Europe

Attack on central bankers and politicians comes as lender retreats from global ambitions

Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing has deepened his criticism of European politicians and central bankers for strangling growth in the region and making it an increasingly unattractive place for international investment.

 Especially for Europe, the sky has darkened,  Mr Sewing said in a speech at the Sibos payments and technology conference in London on Wednesday.  During my meetings and sessions in Asia last week, America and China were the hot topics of conversation. Europe was much less of an issue. We simply aren t that interesting any more for many investors and companies. 

The recent decision of Norway s sovereign wealth fund to switch a significant proportion of its funds into US equities from Europe was  alarming,  and reinforced the need for leaders to  act fast and decisively  so the continent does not  lose its relevance , he said.

This year, Mr Sewing has emerged as a leading critic of central bank policy and politicians  failure to implement structural reforms in Europe. In July, he unveiled a radical restructuring that will see 18,000 jobs cut and relinquish its ambitions to be a global investment bank.

This means the lender is far more reliant on its home market of Europe   and especially Germany, which might slip into recession   to revive growth.

Recently, chief financial officer James von Moltke downgraded the bank s 2022 revenue target by as much as  ¬1bn from  ¬25bn, blaming the worsening macro environment. Privately, executives admit making a return on tangible equity of 8 per cent may no longer achievable in that timeframe.

Mr Sewing also took aim at other European institutions. Specifically, he questioned the decision by Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, to block the merger between the German and French train manufacturers Siemens and Alstom earlier this year, a move they said was needed to compete with state-backed rivals from China.

 Is it really in Europe s best interest to ban the merger between two leading train manufacturers?  he said.  Becoming more competitive includes encouraging our competition authorities to widen their perspective beyond the European market. 

In the wide-ranging speech, Mr Sewing also sharpened his criticism of the European Central Bank after Mario Draghi cut interest rates further into negative territory, a move that will further depress banks  profits and punish savers in the region.

 What is really worrying is that the central banks have used their tools to a large extent already, so there are no conventional measures left to effectively cushion a real economic crisis,  he said.

Mr Sewing called for reforms and initiatives including installing more unified policies and regulations across the single EU market, lowering corporate taxes in step with other countries such as the US and UK, encouraging more big mergers and boosting technological investment.

He said he was also  particularly worried about a series of financial and geopolitical risks   ranging from the situation in Hong Kong to the latest tensions in the Middle East .  These risks create an extraordinary macroeconomic situation that is very difficult to predict and potentially volatile,  he said.

He also flagged up the  aggressive  encroachment of technology companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Alipay into the banks  core businesses of payments and retail as a major concern. He said this was aided by recent regulatory changes such as the EU s Payment Services Directive, or PSD2, which opened up banking to new participants and small fintechs.

 With their vast potential client bases, market capitalisations and data analytics capabilities, they are already taking market share from banks,  he said.  We need to catch-up in terms utilising our vast stores of client data   this is a priority for us at Deutsche Bank as it certainly is for many of our peers.

Swiss trading volumes rise but so do costs after EU ends equivalence rules

Equities

Switzerland's loss of access rights to EU stock markets has concentrated trading in Zurich while raising costs for buying shares in smaller companies, according to research that sheds light on the potential consequences of Brexit.

Banks and fund managers based in the EU were forced to change the way they bought and sold Swiss stocks in early July, after a breakdown in political negotiations resulted in a ban on trading hundreds of such shares in the bloc.

Virtu Financial, one of the world's largest market-makers, analysed $36bn of trades in the eight months to August, covering about 120,000 orders for Swiss stocks and more than 100 institutions across all types of shares and trading venues including bank-operated private electronic marketplaces.

The loss of regulatory "equivalence" for Swiss stocks reduced investment choices and introduced friction into the market, Virtu said in a paper seen by the Financial Times. It also increased costs for buying and selling companies which have a small or medium-sized market capitalisation.

"While the impact to end investors from ending equivalence of Swiss stocks is not fully understood yet, we do observe increases in trading costs ... with small and mid-cap Swiss stocks becoming 20 per cent more expensive."

Virtu is one of the most active traders in European markets and also incorporates data from its subsidiary ITG, an agency broker. . The data was gathered by Virtu's analytics unit. Its findings are being circulated to fund managers this week.

Brussels let the "equivalence" status granted to Switzerland and its stock exchange expire following stalled negotiations over a broader economic agreement. Switzerland retaliated with its own ban on trading Swiss equities on exchanges in the EU.

Virtu found that institutional investors shifted business to the main Swiss exchange from dark pools and rivals such as UK exchanges CBOE Europe and Aquis Exchange. Average five-day spreads for Swiss stocks widened, particularly in small-cap stocks.

It also said costs at so-called "lit" venues, marketplaces where prices are transparent, had increased but said "the distribution of costs makes it hard to detect a clear link to the equivalence change".

Thomas Zeeb, chief executive of the Swiss Stock Exchange, said the volumes on its market had gone up since the equivalence permit expired, but said spreads on deals across the market had reduced by 19 per cent.

He added: "Investors have benefited from a single pool of liquidity more than a fragmented market."

Investors are keeping a close eye on the impact of the EU's withdrawal of equivalence for Switzerland and the implications for UK markets, should Britain leave the bloc at the end of October without a political agreement. Watchdogs across Europe have warned that share trading markets would be split by a no-deal Brexit.

An effort under way at housing-finance company Freddie Mac could increase mortgage approvals for borrowers who might otherwise be shut out of home buying.

Freddie has been testing underwriting software from a financial-technology firm, ZestFinance, that could make mortgages more available for certain applicants, including first-time home buyers and minorities, according to people familiar with the matter. The software evaluates consumers' borrowing and income histories in new ways, the people said.

Freddie has been testing the software for at least several months, the people said. The mortgage company is assessing whether the software can improve the accuracy of its own models' risk predictions, some of the people said.

Freddie and ZestFinance met with Freddie's overseer, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, a few months ago to discuss the matter, the people said. The two companies were scheduled to speak about the effort at a conference next month. Freddie canceled after deciding it wasn't ready to go public with the information, according to one of the people."We are exploring using Zest's software to better manage our risks," a Freddie spokesman said. "We have nothing to announce at this time."

ZestFinance didn't respond to requests for comment. The fintech firm helps big lenders use artificial intelligence, essentially more data combined with better math, to evaluate applicants for loans including credit cards and auto loans.

Freddie and its sibling, Fannie Mae, are in the middle of intense political jockeying. The Trump administration aims to return the two companies to private ownership and recently cautioned against loosening lending standards.

The people familiar with the discussions between Freddie and ZestFinance say the aim isn't to loosen lending standards but to approve applicants who are more financially responsible than stand-alone factors like their credit scores or down-payment amounts suggest. The software could help mortgage lenders identify more borrowers but without increasing the risk of loan losses, the people said.

Freddie helps run the plumbing that underlies the U.S. housing finance system, and its standards affect the entire mortgage market. Freddie and Fannie have been experimenting for several years with steps to make home loans available to more borrowers. In the first half of this year, Fannie and Freddie together backed about 40% of U.S. mortgage originations, according to industry research group Inside Mortgage Finance.The mortgage giants have long had an inherent tension. The two companies are expected to make mortgages more affordable and more readily available, but without taking on the risk that caused them to nearly collapse in the financial crisis. Fannie and Freddie don't make mortgages. Instead, they package home loans into securities, sell them to investors and protect the investors if the loans go bad.

Lenders traditionally consider a consumer's borrowing history, which is encapsulated in their credit reports, when deciding whether to give them a loan.

The ZestFinance software would parse a consumer's financial history to analyze trends including in borrowing and income. Mortgage applicants who could benefit include those who have a low credit score, high debt levels or other red flags but have other positive characteristics, some of the people said.

That could help a person who, for example, has only a small down payment but also has a good credit score. It could also allow for people who have low or no credit scores strictly because of a limited borrowing history to get a mortgage.

Some individuals who fall close to or just below the criteria currently required for loans that Freddie buys could also benefit, some of the people said.

Lenders take a lead from subscription services that make recommendations based on user behaviour

Banks are exploiting artificial intelligence to target individuals with products and third-party rewards based on their specific needs and tastes, as part of a broader effort to strengthen customer relationships by homing in on the  segment of one .

Analysing customer data to set basic loan sizes and terms has become standard practice at most retail banks: they can dissect a user s profile and recurring transactions to predict when they might want to take out an overdraft or insurance policy, for example. But some banks are starting to analyse customers  ad hoc spending to offer discounts with retailers, restaurants and other partners that are tailored specifically to them.

As well as the cross-selling opportunities that analysing user data presents, banks also hope that personalised rewards via external partners will appeal to existing customers and help to attract new ones.

In July, Germany s N26, a digital bank, relaunched its premium account to focus more on personalisation, and now includes discounts with third parties such as flexible workspace provider WeWork and online travel booking site GetYourGuide. These are being offered indiscriminately at first, but the aim is to tailor services to each individual once the bank has gleaned a clearer picture of take-up.

Meanwhile rival Revolut is in the early stages of developing a machine learning product to help customers budget. At present, users must set their own monthly spending limit on individual accounts within the app.

 It s going to look at [your] spending over the last three to six months,  says Revolut s head of marketing Chad West.  And it will be able to make projections on what you ll be able to spend and save. 

That is something Spanish lender BBVA already offers customers via its Bconomy app, which incorporates the 50:20:30 budgeting rule. The concept is to spend 50 per cent of income on basic needs, 20 per cent on savings and use the remainder as disposable income.

By analysing historic transactions, the app can alert customers if they are likely to run short on funds that month and then suggest moving money from a savings account, take out an overdraft or some other type of credit facility.

The bank is trying to go further still by developing a tool that will present each user with a personalised version of the app, which would give prominence to the functions or insights likely to be most useful to that individual on any given day.

 Identifying these needs requires analysing the user s context   browsing history, transactionality, behaviours, etc   through algorithms, similar to how Netflix and Spotify recommend content to their users,  says BBVA head of data, Ricardo Martn Manjn.

It is a trend that is set to play out across large swaths of the banking sector, according to a 2019 survey of nearly 800 banking executives by Accenture, the consultancy.  Digital demographics [ie segmenting users  online behaviour] plus new flexible product configuration capabilities are getting banks much closer to the fabled  segment of one , where products and services are tailored to the individual in real time,  the report said.

Banks have always used predictive modelling in consumer strategies, says Accenture s data monetisation lead, Craig Macdonald. But AI allows banks to  auto-learn from clients on how they react to different types of service and develop more advanced testing techniques,  he says.

The high value of such intricate customer data has not been overlooked by Revolut. When it rolls out its Perks cashback deals   which include discounts on coffee, restaurants and travel   to its 7m customers from December, the company will initially fund the offers itself. But it hopes the rewards package will become popular enough that third parties will foot the cost of partnerships in future.  We would hope to take our data to those companies and gain user discounts,  says Mr West.

The widespread adoption of AI in this context, however, will rely on customer trust that personal data will be handled responsibly and ethically.

In July, the UK government s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation highlighted the potential of harmful   societal biases embedded in targeting criteria, algorithms and the data sets that underpin them . In other words, there is concern that algorithms reflect the unconscious bias of the humans that build them.

For financial services companies, that could include setting credit limits based on a customer s race or gender, for example. One potential solution, the report suggests, is to introduce a layer of auditing to evaluate how companies are using AI and handling data.

In the case of banks working with external partners, Accenture s Mr Macdonald says the consultancy is not aware of any instances where customer data has been exposed.  The major publicly disclosed data breaches in the past few years have been from hacking activity, not from data release from the marketing or advertising data transfer process,  he says.

However, in the US, greater automatic processing of personal information has sparked a rise in the number of class actions concerning the misuse of data, says Kate Scott, partner at law firm Clifford Chance s financial services practice, adding that the UK may be  on the cusp  of a similar trend.

Companies using detailed transaction information to feed algorithms could run into trouble, she warns, either through misuse of personal data regulations, or the  creative  breaching of rules around treating customers fairly when promoting products and services.

 Those claims are clearly possible and I think as there is a growing use of those technologies, we will see more of those types of claims,  says Ms Scott.

ESG investing throws up dilemmas in emerging markets

 Ethical  approach threatens to starve poorest countries of much-needed cash

So-called  ESG  investing, which takes into account environmental, social and corporate governance issues, alongside more traditional fundamental metrics, is seemingly on the verge of taking over the world.

By next year, half of all investment industry assets, a not insignificant $40tn, will be run with an ESG mandate, according to estimates from Deutsche Bank, up from just 25 per cent as recently as 2015, as seen in the first chart.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, emerging markets are still a little behind the ESG pace blazed by developed markets. Moreover, sovereign debt markets have yet to witness the orgy of ESG seen in equity markets, possibly due to the capped upside, and fewer opportunities for engagement and thematic investing,  according to analysis by BlueBay Asset Management and Verisk Maplecroft, a risk analytics company.

Activity levels appear to have accelerated since JPMorgan unveiled ESG versions of its flagship hard and local currency emerging market sovereign bond indices in April last year, though, with Switzerland s Pictet Asset Management last week becoming the latest house to jump on the ESG bandwagon.

 ESG in emerging market debt is at its infancy compared with developed market equity investment, but it s a huge area for growth,  said David Hauner, head of EM cross-asset strategy and economics atBank of America Merrill Lynch.

For those motivated by a desire to make the world a better place, as well as to make money, an ESG-informed approach to EM sovereign bond investing is not without its pitfalls, however.

The overriding one is that wealthier countries tend to have higher ESG ratings than poorer ones. This is the case not only when comparing emerging to developed countries, but also within the EM world, where middle-income countries such as South Korea, Chile and the Czech Republic are rated more highly than the likes of Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ivory Coast.

As a result, if investors simply weight their portfolios towards more ESG-friendly securities, as an equity market investor might do, they will starve the countries arguably most in need of funding, and lend more to those that already have better access to the markets, raising a fresh set of ethical and moral issues.

This is clear in JPMorgan s suite of ESG indices, which are believed to be tracked by around $8bn-$10bn of assets.

Relatively developed countries such as Poland, Lithuania and Slovakia have almost double the weight in the bank s ESG version of its hard-currency debt EMBI Global Diversified index than in the standard benchmark, while 13 poorer, less developed states such as Angola, Cameroon, Ethiopia, India, Iraq, Nigeria and Pakistan are entirely absent from the ESG index.

The ESG version of the local currency GBI-EM GD index varies less from its plain vanilla precursor, but does still overweight the likes of Chile, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Uruguay, while underweighting Indonesia, Russia and Turkey.

 The link between ESG scores and per capita GDP is strong. How can you reconcile a focus on ESG principles with investments in emerging and frontier markets that are, almost by definition, less well governed, more corrupt and increasingly polluted than developed markets?  asked Charles Robertson, chief economist atRenaissance Capital,an emerging markets-focused consultancy.

Mr Hauner agreed that ESG investing in emerging markets was extremely complicated because a lot of the things that you strive for in terms of ESG  are worse than in developed markets.

 They are poorer so they have more pollution, bad health and education and often have significant governance problems,  he said.

This leads to another issue   because an ESG approach inevitably favours middle-income emerging markets over their poorer brethren, it tends to result in portfolios with higher credit ratings and lower yields than a passive non-ESG approach.

The BlueBay/Verisk Maplecroft report found that  once all economic differences are factored out, the [credit] spreads [over US Treasuries] of the best ESG performers are approximately 70 per cent lower than those of the worst. 

Mary-Therese Barton, head of emerging market debt at Pictet Asset Management, who is overseeing the group s foray into ESG, estimated its hard currency ESG fund would typically have a yield 50 basis points below its non-ESG equivalent, with the gap perhaps a little less for local currency debt.

To some extent, this threatens to undermine, or at the very least dilute, one of the key reasons for investing in emerging market bonds   the yield premium over and above that of developed markets   although some are comfortable with this. If over the long term [ESG investing] means lower yields, then so be it,  said Ms Barton.

ESG and non-ESG EM bond portfolios are also likely to exhibit different behaviour in differing market conditions.

 ESG is a proxy for quality, therefore it might do badly in times of risk-on and better in risk-off periods. Maybe that s no bad thing,  said Ms Barton.

Similarly, Mr Hauner, using the example of the EM ESG Government Bond index run by Italy s ECPI Indices, found that it tends to outperform conventional indices during periods of spread widening but tends to underperform during periods of spread tightening.

 ESG investments are likely to generate returns more similar to investment-grade credits [than high-yield bonds],  he added.

Having said that, Mr Hauner argued that there was some scope for investors to switch from sovereigns with low ESG scores to governments with better ones without a meaningful  loss of yield. In the triple-B rated category, this might involve switching from Russia, Kazakhstan or Mexico to Colombia, Peru or Uruguay, while in the double-B world holdings could be transitioned from Ivory Coast, Oman or Uzbekistan to Brazil, Georgia or Namibia.

In theory, at least, this means ESG portfolios should exhibit lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns, Ms Barton said. Moreover, she argued that the differing country mix from that of the standard JPMorgan indices may also have its upside, given concerns in some quarters about the weighting approach of most standard fixed-income indices, which leads to investors buying the most debt from the most indebted countries .

Despite the lower yields, there does not appear to be any great evidence that ESG portfolios underperform conventional ones in the EM government debt firmament, however.

Mr Hauner s research may square this circle, suggestingthat  sovereigns with lower ESG ranks are more likely to experience a sharp worsening in sovereign ratings over the next five to 10 years. By the same token, countries with higher ESG ranks are more likely to be upgraded,  he said, adding that countries that are better governed and have more equal social systems [and therefore, in most cases, higher ESG ratings] tend to deal better with exogenous shocks than dictatorships .

If anything, ESG portfolios may have performed a little better overall. Using back-tested data, cumulative returns from the ESG version of JPMorgan s hard currency EMBI index have been about 1.5 percentage points better than for the standard version since the start of 2013, while returns from the two versions of the local currency GBI-EM benchmark have been identical.

Mr Robertson s research found no correlation, in either direction, between ESG-friendly portfolios and market performance. He believed this might change in the future, however, as ESG investing takes off in the EM sovereign bond sphere.

 The weight of money now in ESG is growing so fast that we do expect it will begin to drive markets in the future,  he said.

Across all asset classes, though, research appears to suggest that when ESG portfolios do outperform, it is almost all down to the  G , with environmental and social factors of relatively little importance.

This calls into question exactly how much of a difference the advent of ESG investing in the world of emerging market sovereign bonds should really make.

As Ms Barton noted  we have always had to think about governance in emerging markets [namely the] willingness and ability to pay .

Indeed, there is some evidence that countries with a high environmental rating actually have higher risk premia, expressed in terms of spreads over Treasuries, than their less green  peers.

The BlueBay/Verisk Maplecroft paper, for instance, found that  markets either ignore or actively penalise better environmental performance   especially when it comes to potentially expensive energy transition and environmental regulation.

 Investors still prefer countries that have ineffective environmental regulations, manage water and waste poorly, and are not making an effort to decarbonise   except when their economies are robust enough to absorb the cost of high performance in these areas, which is expensive and only designed to pay off in the long term, outside market time horizons,  it added.

Mr Hauner s research found that  E  does not show a clear relationship to sovereign ratings, most likely because some of the fastest-growing economies also tend to be highly polluting .

Similarly, Mr Robertson noted that if a developing country has wanted to raise its wealth level, it has generally had to pollute more , suggesting credit spreads and environmental ratings may typically fall in unison.

He did though, suggest that if a country was becoming wealthier, its S  and G  scores should be improving, balancing the deterioration in E  and meaning it can still sit happily in an ESG portfolio even if its carbon emissions are rising.

Whatever the truth of this, there is broad agreement that engagement is more likely than disengagement to drive ESG improvement in emerging countries.

 It comes down to the issue of market discipline. You can get better borrowing costs if you improve your ESG score,  Mr Hauner said. They have a ton of room for improvement. 

Mr Robertson favours the same engagement approach, arguing that the danger is that ESG is hypocrisy and a tool of cultural imperialism , if low scores are used as an excuse to avoid some countries, bearing in mind that the rich west would itself have had terrible ESG scores, by modern measures, as it was industrialising.

 Our conclusion is that if your goal is to improve ESG outcomes, then investing in emerging and frontier markets should be your first port of call, not your last,  he said.

 It is EM and FM that can see the biggest improvements in education, health, gender equality, corruption, the rule of law and governance overall. Refusing to invest because countries currently have lower ESG scores than top-performing Denmark will slow growth in EM and FM and leave investors complicit in sustaining huge social and governance inequality around the world.

AI can streamline insurance claims   but at what cost?

Algorithms promise to cut bureaucracy, yet this could leave insurers more exposed to fraud

Insurance claims are, by their nature, painful processes. They happen only when something has gone wrong and they can take months to resolve. Even then, claimants might receive less than they feel they are due and wind up frustrated by the whole experience.

Chinese insurer Ping An thinks it has found the answer to this problem by using artificial intelligence to speed up the process.

A customer involved in a motor accident, for example, can take a photo of the damage with a phone and send it to Ping An. The insurer s algorithms assess what type of car is involved, how significant the damage is, and how much it will cost to fix. It can then send over an offer to settle the claim straight away.

Ping An is not the only insurer to streamline the claims process using new tech. Over the past few years, the claims sector has been one of the most active areas of AI deployment in insurance   sometimes with eye-catching results.

In 2017, New York-based insurance start-up Lemonade said that it had paid a claim for a stolen $979 Canada Goose jacket in just three seconds. Daniel Schreiber, Lemonade s chief executive, says that sort of thing now happens  multiple times a day .

AI can help to cut administrative costs, potentially to the benefit of both insurers and their customers. According to Mr Schreiber:  In the US, 11-13 per cent of the premiums you pay are consumed by 	. 	. 	. 	the bureaucracy of handling claims. That s pretty crazy. A bot handling claims in seconds delights customers and crushes costs. 

Insurers also hope that AI will help to cut back on fraudulent claims, which they say push up prices for customers. Algorithms can be trained to look out for suspicious signs and then flag the claim for further examination if necessary.

 Fraud is a huge thing,  says Chris Sandilands, a consultant at Oxbow Partners, which advises the insurance industry.  There are a lot of opportunities in using AI to spot evolving fraud patterns.  One example, he says, is using technology to detect personal links between people involved in different aspects of a claim.

There are fears that use of AI could make some types of fraud easier, however. People could use false receipts to claim ownership of a stolen item, for example.

 Regulators are very wary of AI,  says Heidi Lawson, a partner at law firm Cooley.  They are worried about the financial stability of insurers because losses can be very high. 

Even without deliberate fraud, it may take a while for algorithms to work out which claims should be paid out in full and which should not.

In its early years, Lemonade paid a lot of claims and its loss ratio   a measure of insurance payouts as a proportion of premiums   was very high. For most of last year, Lemonade s loss ratio was above 100 per cent, suggesting that it was paying out more in claims than it was receiving in premiums. According to the Insurance Information Institute, the average loss ratio for US home insurers in 2018 was 73.9 per cent.

Mr Schreiber says that AI  may have played a role  in the high loss ratios. The company has since made improvements to its systems and the loss ratio has fallen to 87 per cent in the first quarter of this year, down from 146 per cent 12 months earlier.

Some insurance experts say there are potentially more sinister reasons to be wary of AI in handling claims. One is the possible use of claims optimisation   the practice of paying out the minimum amount that a customer will accept without complaining. For example, people in need of money quickly might accept a lower payout for a quick settlement; those in less need may hold out for more.

Duncan Minty, an insurance ethics consultant, says there are a lot of legal questions around this behaviour, and that it could create a  vicious circle  for the industry   if customers believe that insurers will not pay out the full claim, then there is an incentive to inflate the size of the claim that is submitted.

It is up to insurers, adds Mr Minty, to make sure that they build safeguards into their algorithms.  Insurers really have to get the oversight in place to make sure it doesn t go down a wrong turn,  he says.

Trading costs rise after Switzerland s loss of EU access rights

Price of trading shares in small and mid-cap companies has increased by a fifth, analysis shows

Switzerland s loss of access rights to EU stock markets has concentrated trading in Zurich while raising costs for buying shares in smaller companies, according to research that sheds light on the potential consequences of Brexit.

Banks and fund managers based in the EU were forced to change the way they bought and sold Swiss stocks in early July after a breakdown in political negotiations resulted in a ban on trading hundreds of such shares in the bloc.

Virtu Financial, one of the world s largest market-makers, analysed $36bn of trades in the eight months to August, covering about 120,000 orders for Swiss stocks and more than 100 institutions   across all types of shares and trading venues including bank-operated private electronic marketplaces.

The loss of regulatory  equivalence  for Swiss stocks reduced investment choices and introduced friction into the market, Virtu said in a paper seen by the Financial Times. It increased costs for buying and selling companies with a small or medium-sized market capitalisation.

 While the impact to end investors from ending equivalence of Swiss stocks is not fully understood yet, we do observe increases in trading costs 	. 	. 	. 	with small and mid-cap Swiss stocks becoming 20 per cent more expensive. 

Virtu is one of the most active traders in European markets and also its subsidiary ITG, an agency broker. The data was gathered by Virtu s analytics unit. Its findings are being circulated to fund managers this week.

Brussels let the  equivalence  status granted to Switzerland and its stock exchange expire following stalled negotiations over a broader economic agreement. Switzerland retaliated with its own ban on trading Swiss equities on exchanges in the EU.

Virtu found that institutional investors shifted business to the main Swiss exchange from dark pools and rivals such as UK exchanges CBOE Europe and Aquis Exchange. Average five-day spreads for Swiss stocks widened, particularly in small-cap stocks.

It also said costs at  lit  venues, marketplaces where prices are transparent, had increased but said  the distribution of costs makes it hard to detect a clear link to the equivalence change .

Thomas Zeeb, chief executive of the Swiss Stock Exchange, said the volumes on its market had gone up since the equivalence permit expired, but said spreads on deals across the market had reduced by 19 per cent.  Investors have benefited from a single pool of liquidity more than a fragmented market. 

Investors are keeping a close eye on the impact of the EU s withdrawal of equivalence for Switzerland and the implications for UK markets, should Britain leave the bloc at the end of October without a political agreement.

Watchdogs across Europe have warned that share trading markets would be split by a no-deal Brexit, but have differed over the best way to prepare.

The EU s main markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority, has called on UK counterparts to lay out their plans in detail. Britain has urged the EU to issue more temporary equivalence permits to countries and institutions in order to smooth out market dislocations.

What's Next for Company Chatbots; As the technology saves businesses money, they are exploring making chatbots better and putting them to new uses

Early corporate adopters of chatbots, finding that the technology has saved them money, are working to improve them and exploring other areas where they could be put to use.

Chatbots use artificial-intelligence-based algorithms to understand and answer text or voice questions from customers and sometimes employees. Companies such as TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., Ernst & Young LLP, Progressive Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. have rolled out chatbots in recent years and say they are seeing tangible benefits.

"It's a key part of our strategy and we'll continue to invest in it," said Vijay Sankaran, chief information officer at brokerage firm TD Ameritrade.

Since it began offering text- and voice-based chatbots to clients in 2017, TD Ameritrade hasn't needed to hire any new human agents, even though it has added many more clients, Mr. Sankaran said. Chatbots can answer basic questions about trade statuses and resetting passwords, while humans help with more complex problems related to taxes and beneficiaries.

Insurer Progressive offers "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2018/05/23/businesses-get-into-the-flo-with-chatbots/" on Facebook Messenger and in apps; it plans to roll one out on its website later this year. Chatbots are expected to save the company about $5 million this year thanks to fewer conversations requiring human agents, said Matt White, a customer-experience and -acquisition manager.

The chatbots can help current and prospective customers with queries about policy coverage, discounts and changing billing dates. The company has also seen undisclosed revenue increases as customers buy more insurance policies because they can get answers to questions about insurance coverage quickly and anytime, Mr. White said.

About three-quarters of businesses surveyed by the France-based Capgemini Research Institute, an arm of consulting and technology-services firm Capgemini SE, said they have seen quantifiable benefits from voice- or text-based chatbots, according to a "https://www.capgemini.com/research/smart-talk/". The survey of about 1,000 executives found that 88% said those benefits including lower customer service costs and better user engagement had met or exceeded expectations.

The cost to develop a chatbot ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, depending on the project and the client, said Tom Hebner, head of product innovation, voice technology and AI at chatbot vendor Nuance Communications Inc.

Within the next few years, more companies could be using chatbots to authenticate customers based on their unique voices and the way they type, Mr. Hebner said. Chatbots could also be used more widely in call centers as the technology improves, he added.

Chatbots are already getting smarter. Drift.com Inc. is expanding the rollout of a chatbot platform that features "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatbot-handles-curveball-questions-helps-winnow-sales-leads-11568021400" The technology allows it to respond to customers even if they switch topics a task that's difficult for other chatbots.

Companies are also using chatbots to supplement their human-resources departments.

IBM has used its Watson AI technology to launch more than a dozen text-based HR chatbots since 2014. Chatbots handle about 40% of basic inquiries from the company's 350,000 employees, which means IBM doesn't need to hire more HR staffers even when some employees leave. "We've brought on fewer people but we also have new jobs and they're paid more because they're higher-skill," said Diane Gherson, chief human resources officer for IBM.

By year-end, the company aims to integrate a more advanced AI technology called Watson Discovery into the chatbots to make them smarter. The chatbots will be able to learn in real time whenever content on an HR website has changed, and then answer a person's question accordingly instead of just pointing the employee to that website.

Professional-services firm Ernst & Young has been using an HR chatbot named Goldie for two years, saving HR staff more than 10,000 hours of work between December 2018 and June, said Penny Stoker, global leader of HR services at EY. The company added more features to the chatbot over time, such as a way to answer questions about the day's weather, after seeing employees engage with it beyond HR uses.

The Future of Finance (A Special Report) --- Small ESG Investors Loom Large --- These niche investors can have a big impact on company actions

A small group of niche investors guided by environmental, social and governance principles are emerging as a big influence on corporate decision making.

These investors -- religious funds, boutique asset managers and single-issue organizations -- are routinely punching above their weight in driving companies in their portfolios to address sustainability issues and ethical concerns. They're doing so by filing frequent shareholder resolutions and pushing other shareholders, including asset managers many times their size, to play along.

A measure of their success is getting the big index-fund providers on board with their initiatives. The Big Three -- BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. -- collectively control an average of one in five shares of the S&P 500 companies, giving them an outsize role in voting power and influence, according to a working paper published in June by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Niche investors have frequently sought to gain the backing of large index funds in the pursuit of environmental and social initiatives as a way to amplify their message and increase pressure on companies. In some cases, they succeed.

About one-third of ESG resolutions are filed by self-identified socially responsible investors, the largest group to do so, followed by pension funds and faith-based managers, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute, a nonprofit that tracks resolutions and proxy votes.

In 2017, sustainability-focused investors asked energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan Inc. to start measuring, monitoring and setting reduction targets for methane gas emissions across the company's operations. The resolution was co-filed by Robeco Institutional Asset Management BV, employee-owned investment firm Miller/Howard Investments Inc. and faith-based asset manager Mercy Investment Services Inc. "We are long-term shareholders," says Carola van Lamoen, head of active ownership at Robeco. "We engage for change because we are convinced that it is in the long-term interest of the company." The proposal came up to a vote at last year's annual shareholders' meeting.

Though their specific proposal didn't pass, the methane reduction targets were eventually included as part of a broader resolution calling for a sustainability report that got a majority of votes. Both resolutions garnered the support of BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.

In October 2018, Kinder Morgan published its first formal report giving more details on its methane emission reduction practices.

Calvert Research & Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. that manages ESG funds, filed a shareholder resolution with railroad company Genesee & Wyoming Inc. in 2017 asking the company to set reduction targets for greenhouse-gas emissions. The resolution got a 57% vote of support at the company's general meeting in 2018, and was backed by the Big Three. The company subsequently published a sustainability report and indicated its intention to adopt carbon-reduction goals.

Overall, the number of ESG shareholder resolutions that have come to a vote has gone down in recent years. But the number of proposals withdrawn has risen, indicating investors' success in getting managers to engage in dialogue before initiatives get as far as the ballot -- an approach embraced both by niche investors and the biggest fund firms.

Nearly half of all environmental-related proposals were withdrawn in advance of 2019 meetings, compared with 33% two years ago, according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. There seems to be a "greater willingness on the part of companies and proponents to negotiate outcomes on environmental topics," says Peter Kimball, head of advisory services at ISS Corporate Solutions, a corporate governance and sustainability consultancy. Around 45% of shareholder proposals related to social issues were withdrawn last year, up from 34% two years earlier, according to ISS.

VC Daily: Zero-Down for Homes; Sweetgreen Funding; Postmates Launches Delivery Robots; Medtech Outlook

Good day. Revenue at medical-technology corporations is soaring, but the outlook isn't entirely good for the sector, EY finds in a new report.

Revenue in the medtech sector increased 7% to $407.2 billion in 2018 from the year before, and are the highest recorded to date, the report says. But underinvestment in research and development and a lack of collaboration between the medtech industry and insurers and patients clouds the long-term outlook.

R&D spending rose 11% in 2018 from the disappointing levels that industry watchers saw in 2017. But it isn't clear whether that rebound represents the beginning of a sustained reinvestment.

Moreover, capital-allocation trends suggest that corporations still focus more on near-term growth through share repurchases. And aside from a few megadeals, medtech acquirers are prioritizing tuck-in purchases rather than bold or transformative deals, the report says.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Salad funding. Investors are putting another $150 million behind Sweetgreen Inc., betting that the salad restaurant chain's embrace of technology will deliver them an exit in a sector that has seen minimal venture activity in recent years, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/salad-chain-sweetgreens-tech-focus-helps-push-valuation-to-1-6-billion-11569008888?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

* The Culver City, Calif.-based company said it was valued at $1.6 billion in the financing round, up from a $1 billion valuation when it last raised capital 10 months ago.

* A pair of hedge-fund managers, Lone Pine Capital and D1 Capital Partners, led the round, with participation from True Ventures and other existing investors.

* Sweetgreen first raised outside capital early this decade, when the food sector was gaining some traction with venture investors. Some venture capitalists had shied away from bricks-and-mortar businesses, preferring to fund startups with internet-based business models. Others saw an opportunity to fund fast-growing brands.

No cash, no problem. People with steady incomes but less-than-perfect credit are often shut out of buying homes because they can't qualify for a mortgage. A San Francisco startup, Divvy Homes, says it has an answer: It buys homes on behalf of clients, then rents the homes to the consumers as part of a deal that lets them build up equity toward a purchase, WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron reports.

* Divvy, along with companies such as ZeroDown, Flyhomes and others, are among a wave of startups creating new paths to homeownership at a time when high home prices and a limited supply of starter homes have made it difficult for some people to enter the market.

* Millennials, in particular, face steep obstacles to homeownership because of student-loan debt and low savings due to slow career starts during the recession.

* Some of these firms, like Divvy, enable would-be buyers to bypass big down payments and mortgages with lease-to-own contracts. Others will make all-cash offers on behalf of clients competing for homes in hot markets.

Robots on demand. On-demand delivery company Postmates Inc., which is preparing to go public, is launching autonomous robots to deliver food, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/postmates-rolls-out-robots-in-los-angeles-as-it-preps-for-ipo-11569240000?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

The company last month began using rolling robots in Los Angeles to make deliveries. He said Postmates is aiming to introduce several thousand robots to make deliveries in Los Angeles. Postmates is the latest technology company to experiment using rolling robots for delivery, which could help lower costs as many food delivery startups struggle to reach profitability. As part of its robot rollout, Postmates is tapping Mountain View, Calif.-based startup Phantom Auto Inc. to equip its robots with remote human control technology.

Exits

HP Inc. acquired cybersecurity company Bromium Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Investors in the Cupertino, Calif.-based company included Andreessen Horowitz, Ignition Partners, Highland Capital Partners, Intel Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Meritech Capital Partners and Silver Lake Waterman.

On-demand moving-and-storage startup Clutter Inc. acquired Storage Fox, which operates storage properties in New York state, for $152 million. Culver City, Calif.-based Clutter launched in 2015 and has raised $300 million in funding from investors including SoftBank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital, Atomico and GV.

Unity Technologies, a San Francisco-based maker of a three-dimensional development platform used by video game creators and in other industries, acquired fellow game development technology provider deltaDNA for an undisclosed sum. In June, D1 Capital Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Light Street Capital, Sequoia Capital and Silver Lake Partners agreed to invest up to $675 million in Unity, valuing the company at $6 billion. DeltaDNA has offices in San Francisco and Scotland, and is listed in the portfolios of Par Equity and Edge Investments.

VC Funds

Biotechnology and medical technology investor Longitude Capital seeks to raise $550 million for its fourth fund, according to a regulatory filing. The firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Calif., and Greenwich, Conn., closed its Longitude Venture Partners III LP fund in 2016 with $525 million.

Tech News

Pinterest harnesses AI for visual-based shopping. The company says its AI technology can identify more than 2.5 billion objects in photos of fashion and home dcor.

Startups' TV advertising soars in new report. Young brands that once advertised nearly exclusively through digital media are moving into television at a rapid clip, according to a new report on U.S. ad spending for the U.S.

SEC's Clayton says SEC doesn't judge direct listings.

The SEC doesn't mind when companies go public using a cheaper "direct listing" on exchanges instead of a traditional offering, where investment banks underwrite the deal, the agency's chairman said.

A  grass-roots' campaign to take down Amazon is funded by Amazon's biggest rivals. Walmart, Oracle and mall owner Simon Property Group are secret funders behind a nonprofit that has been highly critical of the e-commerce giant.

Zuckerberg meets with Trump, faces tough questions from senators. With his company under a regulatory spotlight, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met at the White House with President Trump Thursday but faced a chillier reception from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

TD Bank Deploys Internally Developed Explainability Tool

Toronto-Dominion Bank Group is using a software tool built in-house that explains how its artificial-intelligence systems make decisions.

The tool, which TD talked about for the first time earlier this month, was developed so that software engineers at the bank could tell its business executives how its systems arrive at conclusions, according to Tomi Poutanen, TD's chief AI officer. It was first deployed in mid-2018.

Executives in regulated industries, including finance, "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2018/09/26/tech-giants-launch-new-ai-tools-as-worries-mount-about-explainability/" that both computer scientists and business managers understand algorithmic decision-making. That knowledge could guard against potential ethical and regulatory breaches.

While there are a number of explainability tools on the market, many of which are open source, Saniye Alaybeyi, a senior director at research and advisory company Gartner Inc., said it makes sense for businesses to develop their own auditing software because commercial offerings aren't customized for industry segments.

"Every bank is different, every bank's customers are different, every bank's problems are different," she said. "Explainability cannot be bought."

The bank's explainability tool was the brainchild of Layer 6, a TD-owned company. TD, Canada's second-largest bank by market capitalization after Royal Bank of Canada, bought Layer 6 for an undisclosed sum in January 2018. Mr. Poutanen was a Layer 6 co-founder.

Among Layer 6's other work has been the development of a predictive AI application for TD's mortgage business. The model analyzes credit bureau data, account and transaction data, demographic information and other sources to spot banking clients who are thinking of buying a home. Once identified, a TD representative can reach out to the person to discuss next steps or begin the loan process.

The bank's explainability system works like an auditing tool, analyzing input data as well as the AI model itself.

It looks inside the AI model to see what data points are being used to make decisions. For instance, in the mortgage prediction model, the explainability system might note that a customer's increased savings was the determining factor in deciding that he or she might soon be applying for a mortgage. Or the system might note that a customer's debt load was the deciding factor in assessing that he or she wasn't likely to be looking for a loan in the near future.

In order to understand more about how a model behaves, such as a machine-learning model that recognizes and learns from patterns, the tool looks at any repeating patterns to determine how they developed.

Mr. Poutanen said the tool fits what the bank requires. "You can't just slap on somebody else's explainability framework on a model you built yourself and hope it works," he said.

The battle over EU s wide-ranging open banking legislation, PSD2 is far from over

The EU is set to respond this week to months of pressure from the banking and payments industries over controversial new rules   but not in the way that the lobbyists would like.

Last week was supposed to mark a milestone for the fintech industry with the implementation of the final parts of the EU s wide-ranging open banking legislation, PSD2.

The new rules are designed to improve competition by opening up access to the customer data held by banks. They should make it easier for fintechs to offer services like account aggregation or bypass card networks by making payments straight from a bank account.

But the battle over one particularly contentious part of the legislation is far from over, with banks, payments firms and even national regulators gearing up for a fresh fight with the EU.

The rule in question is known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). While most of PSD2 focuses on ways to improve competition by opening up access to customer data, SCA is designed to ensure that the changes aren t accompanied by a jump in fraud.

The SCA rules will force customers to occasionally enter their PIN when making contactless payments in stores, or to go through an extra layer of authentication when buying products online.

Few would argue with the goal of reducing fraud, but much of the industry has been angered by the way the EU and its top banking regulator, the European Banking Authority, have gone about it.

The EBA says firms have had years to prepare, but industry groups have complained that some key technical details weren t confirmed until the last minute.

The confusion led to warnings that a lack of preparedness would make more than a quarter of online payments impossible to complete if the rules came into force as planned last week.

In the end, the impact last week was limited after the EBA gave a partial reprieve   allowing national supervisors to implement localised delays to enforcement. However, firms have continued to push for more co-ordinated action to avoid creating extra complications for cross-border firms, and to avoid encouraging regulatory arbitrage as firms relocate some activities to countries with lighter-touch regimes.

Last week, trade groups and major companies including the European Payment Institutions Federation, European Hotel Forum, Visa and Mastercard wrote an open letter to the EBA calling for an 18-month transition, with another 18 months to meet requirements in particularly complex areas such as travel and hospitality.

Those groups were joined on Friday by the European Banking Federation, which represents thousands of lenders.

The EBA has so far remained silent on the matter publicly, and didn t respond to a request for comment from fintechFT. But two people briefed on the negotiations said it spent the second half of last week discussing a delay with national authorities. Unfortunately for the lobby groups, however, the two people said the EBA was pushing for an implementation period of just 12 months.

 Some of the smaller countries can get it done in 12 months because they don t have as large a cards market,  said one person briefed on the discussions,  but for the larger jurisdictions 	. 	. 	. 	the solutions that need to be built physically can t be built in that time. 

 The debates are quite heated,  the person added, with the Banque de France and Denmark s Financial Supervisory Authority among the most vocal opponents of the EBA s approach. Both want a longer delay.

The EBA is expected to break its silence later this week, but given the growing concern in the industry, it is unlikely to be the final word on the matter.

Quick fire Q&A

Company name: Hippo Insurance

When founded: 2015

Where based: Palo Alto, California

CEO: Assaf Wand

Amount of money raised so far: $209m

Valuation at latest fundraising: $1bn

Major shareholders: Bond, Comcast Ventures, Felicis Ventures, Fifth Wall, Hillhouse Capital, Horizons Ventures, ICONIQ Capital, Lennar Corporation, Michael Ovitz, Pipeline Capital, Propel Venture Partners, RPM Ventures, Standard Industries and Zeev Ventures.

What do you sell, and who do you sell it to?Modern home insurance to more than half of US homeowners across 20 states. We create policies that fit the needs of today s homeowners, with an online 60-second quote process.

How did you get started? I spent several years researching and analysing the insurance industry, and truly discovered just how outdated the industry was during my time at McKinsey. I believed that by building a platform that supports modern customers, and bringing real time data into the equation, my team and I could eliminate pain points   from financial losses due to lack of coverage, to frustrating claims experiences.

There are lots of fintechs out there  what makes you so special?Hippo modernises home insurance by refocusing on the customer. Traditional insurance companies only interact with you when you ve got a claim. Hippo s insurance uses technology that can help prevent a claim from happening in the first place. To automate the home insurance process we built our own technology stack, complete with an AI framework to expedite the customer application process and a proprietary policy management system in-house, which closes claims with a single point of contact. As part of Hippo's commitment to preventive home care, the company provides all its customers with complimentary smart home devices, to alert homeowners to water leaks, fire damage and break-ins.

Further fintech fascination

Follow the money: It s been a big week for fintech fundraising. Stripe, the payments company, raised $250m in a funding round that valued it at $35bn. Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst and Sequoia Capital were among those getting out their cheque books.Petal, a New York based fintech which offers credit cards, has raised $300m in debt from Jefferies, the investment bank. And in Germany, Deutsche Bank has paid  ¬50m for a 5 per cent stake in Deposit Solutions, an open banking start-up. The deal gives the Hamburg-based company a valuation of over  ¬1bn.

Stumbling blocks: Not all fintechs are thriving though. The UK sDaily Telegraph reports that a start-up backed by Goldman Sachs and HSBC has laid off 20 per cent of its staff despite recently raising 20m in funding. Bud, which makes software that allows financial firms to connect to each other, has cut back on marketing staff but is still hiring engineers.

Stumbling blocks (2):Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent are refusing to hand over data about customer loans to a government-backed credit scoring programme, reports the Financial Times. The People s Bank of China launched the programme, called Baihang, in March last year but its coverage has been patchy. The system is designed to cover the 460m Chinese who have no formal credit history.

New frontiers:German insurtech start-up Simplesurance is moving into Japan, signing a deal with insurer Tokio Marine and airline ANA to offer travel cancellation cover. The company says it is the first to offer cover for fees and refund charges if a customer cancels a flight due to it potentially being suspended because of bad weather. Simplesurance now operates in 28 European countries as well as Japan, and CEO Robin von Hein says the company is now looking at south east Asia.

AOB: Watch out tomorrow for the FT s special report on the Future of Fintech. An essential guide to the state of fintech around the world, it covers topics as diverse as sharia fintech, the use of artificial intelligence in insurance claims, and efforts to make banking more like Netflix.

Government pension scheme under pressure to drop active managers When government officials start opining on investment you just know it is right to do the opposite. Epsenhancement via FT.com Talk about throwing the baby out with the bath water. I am normally against active managers, as most of them add little value.

In some cases it will be pure ML, in others ML plus advanced statistical methods, and in the rest ML plus advanced statistical methods and advanced visualisation. This is because the current problem within the industry is that it relies too much on hugely simplifying assumptions such as linear models or linear dependencies through correlations and/or on non-quantitative expert views.

INTERVIEW Columbia Threadneedle chief on providing returns with ESG investments

T ed Truscott is an early riser. The chief executive of Columbia Threadneedle Investments, the $468bn asset manager, is up regularly at 4am to catch up on emails and calls with colleagues.

"Sleep is very inefficient. Four or five hours are all that I need," says Mr Truscott with a broad smile.

The 59-year-old looks remarkably fresh having flown overnight to London after participating in the shorter sprint segment of the Boston Triathlon, an event that Columbia Threadneedle has sponsored for the past four years.

"Being flexible and adaptable enough to swim, run and ride a bike is a metaphor for our business," he says.

More than 100 staff in Boston either participated in the triathlon or volunteered at the event which raises money for the Boston Medical Center.

"It's about working together, encouraging each other. There's nothing quite like hearing your colleagues shouting 'Go Ted. You got this.' It's great," he says.

Along with other traditional active managers, Columbia Threadneedle's business has suffered due to intense competition from bigger rivals led by BlackRock and Vanguard.

Laughter often punctuates his conversation, even when asked if a former colleague's description of the company's product range as "a dog's breakfast" is accurate.

"We have conducted two rounds of fund mergers in the US and reduced the European fund range by a third. This is ongoing work and a balance is needed as we have to make sure that we fulfil our obligations to clients," he says.

Clients, however, have pulled around $81.5bn from Columbia Threadneedle since the start of 2015 as the shift from active funds into low-cost trackers has gathered pace globally. Morningstar rates just nine of 105 Columbia funds and 11 of 85 Threadneedle funds in the top 10 per cent of their respective categories. The departure this year of Michelle Scrimgeour and Mark Burgess, the CEO and CIO for Europe respectively, has added to the difficulties confronting the company.

"It has been tough and part of our job is to become better known. I match our teams against any out there every day of the week. We have a record to prove it. Come and meet our teams, look at our product offering, our ESG reports," says Mr Truscott, who has run Ameriprise's asset management operations for more than a decade.

Mr Truscott rarely gives interviews but he readily tackles questions about his leadership.

"Columbia Threadneedle is a low ego culture and I keep a reasonably low profile. Our job is to get the job done and not be too flashy about it," he explains.

The division was created via multiple deals and acquisitions by Mr Truscott and his boss, Jim Cracchiolo, the chief executive of Ameriprise Financial, the parent group. Columbia Management was bought for around $1.2bn from Bank of America in 2009.

Threadneedle, which started in 1994 as an investment unit of British American Tobacco, was acquired in 2003 from Zurich Financial Services by American Express which then spun off its financial planning unit as Ameriprise in 2005. In 2015, Columbia and Threadneedle were sewn together as a unified global platform.

Other deals have expanded the platform. Emerging Global Advisors, a $900m New York-based boutique specialising in emerging market exchange traded funds was acquired in 2016. The following year, Lionstone Partners, a $6bn Houstonbased real estate investment manager, was purchased.

"It is all aimed at producing good results for the client. Your success. Our priority," says Mr Truscott, not missing an opportunity to rhyme off the company motto.

More deals may follow. Moving into private credit would be a natural extension to Columbia Threadneedle's existing capabilities but Mr Truscott emphasises the need to remain "very disciplined and mindful of the cultural fit" with any prospective partner.

"We look at almost everything but we do relatively little. The solution to reversing the outflows is not just scale alone," he explains.

Part of his strategy has involved strengthening research capabilities.

"We are hiring additional analysts, paying for sellside research and investing more in big data to generate alpha [market beating returns]," says Mr Truscott.

Steps will also be taken to expand Columbia Threadneedle's exchange traded fund unit, an area where the company has historically lacked a significant presence.

"ETFs can't just be clones of our existing products. We can show our skills by embedding responsible investment strategies into ETFs. There are lots of developments to come," he promises.

His interest in responsible investment has been fuelled in part by his role as vice-chair of the trustee board of Middlebury college, his alma mater in Vermont.

"It has given me a bird's-eye view on what millennials want when you talk to them about climate change and the social and governance aspects of responsible investment. I strongly believe that we can make good returns for clients while investing in companies that are doing well on all of these ESG criteria," he says.

As an avid reader of the Financial Times, the troubles at Woodford Investment Management have not escaped his attention.

"This is just the latest in a series of problems related to fund liquidity. Anything that damages the reputation of active management is not good for the investment industry. We don't want those headlines. We have to keep the client at the centre of everything that we do and conduct ourselves with integrity," he says.

He firmly believes that "tone at the top" is essential because asset management is "a people business". Ensuring that his own weekends are not frequently interrupted with work remains a challenge.

"My wife and family and my friends would all definitely say that I work too much. You can never get it quite right. Sometimes there are not enough hours in the day."

Not even for a person who can thrive on just four hours sleep.
