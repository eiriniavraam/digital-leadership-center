In a world where prized assets are scarce, a move by a major player forces the hand of another.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 So it is with\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing\uc2 , which is taking a rebuffed \u163\'00\'A332bn bid for the\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 London Stock Exchange Group\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0 to shareholders. The Chinese exchange is hoping to break up a $27bn deal the \uc2 LSE\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0 struck to buy\u160\'00\'A0Refinitiv, a data and trading group.\par \par \uc2 If either deal completes it will be by far the largest exchanges deal in history, and underscore how the industry\u8217\'20\'19s biggest bourses have been radically remoulded since the turn of the century.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt has been such a dynamic industry; driven by regulatory, geopolitical, macroeconomic, technological changes,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 David Schwimmer\uc2 , chief executive of the LSE, said on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 In the late 1990s exchanges began facing competition as electronic competition began to eat at their profits. The broad response was the shed their mutual status and hunt for new markets.\par \par \uc2 A period of intense dealmaking began, characterised by megadeals and dramatic interventions. In the mid-noughties the \uc2 CME Group\uc2  set itself up to become the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest exchange by market value with the $8bn purchase of the \uc2 Chicago Board of Trade\uc2  and an $8.9bn deal for the \uc2 New York Mercantile Exchange\uc2 . \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange\uc2 , which also bid for the \uc2 CBOT\uc2 , consoled itself with the New York Board of Trade for $1bn.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 LSE\uc2  bought \uc2 Borsa Italiana\uc2  and \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  and \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 having both failed with bids for the \uc2 LSE\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 purchased OMX and the International Securities Exchange. The \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2  used its shares to acquire Archipelago and merge with \uc2 Euronext\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That heightened buying spree slowed as the crisis led regulators and politicians to reassess their assumptions about financial markets and flex their muscles. A turning point was the Australian government\u160\'00\'A0 blocking Singapore\u8217\'20\'19s SGX from buying \uc2 ASX\uc2 , operator of the main Australian exchange, in 2011.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0 suffered twice when EU antitrust regulators blocked its mergers with the \uc2 LSE\uc2  and \uc2 NYSE Euronext\uc2 . Successful big deals were rare. \uc2 ICE\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 a commodity derivatives bourse which was only founded in 1999 \u8212\'20\'14 grabbed attention with the $8.2bn\u160\'00\'A0 purchase of the NYSE in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Those that were approved tended to be where there was little competitive overlap. Exchanges had begun to realise that ambitious cross-border deals were fraught with many\u160\'00\'A0beginning to see themselves very differently to their histories as venues for trading. It was the world\u8217\'20\'19s insatiable demand for data that offered the most promise for the future.\par \par \uc2 ICE\uc2  made the first pivot, purchasing \uc2 Interactive Data Corp\uc2  for $5.2bn.

Over poached lobster in Mayfair, the private equity firm's combative co-founder talks to Lionel Barber about risk-taking, Trump whispering and why the rich shouldn't have to pay more tax\par \par \uc2 W hen \uc2 Stephen Schwarzman\uc2  originally proposed lunch, he suggested two venues: Claridge's or St Tropez. Naively, I assumed there was a choice. A rendezvous on the C\u244\'00\'F4te d'Azur, where Schwarzman enjoys one of his many palatial residences, was always a tad risky for a man who loves to control the situation.\par \par \uc2 Invited for 12.15pm, I spot Schwarzman standing centre stage in The Foyer & Reading Room restaurant. Short and tanned, he's wearing a lightly pinstriped dark suit with his favourite combination: blue-striped shirt with white collar and purple tie. He's put on a few pounds since he was a top runner in high school and college, but at 72 he still looks trim.\par \par \uc2 Encounters with Schwarzman are rarely dull. He's a combative character who, while outwardly charming, does not take kindly to criticism. We've exchanged expletives in Davos and in his luxuriously appointed office at \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 , the Wall Street private equity and asset management firm he co-founded 34 years ago. But there have never been any hard feelings.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman's fortune (net worth about $18bn) has bought him power and influence. He's graduated from being a mega dealmaker to philanthropist, back channel in US-China relations and "Trump whisperer". I want to explore these multiple roles, but also pin down why the man who has built one of the most successful financial businesses on the planet has never quite received the credit he believes he deserves.\par \par \uc2 A Wall Street rival offers a clue: "Steve is one of the most honest people I know. Most people lie to your face. He'll always tell you straight up he's going to screw you."\par \par \uc2 As we study our menus, I raise the character question. His restless, driven nature is legendary. "Yes, it's true," he admits. "It goes with the territory, the person." As if on cue, he announces we're moving table because of a cold draught, compounded by noisy neighbours.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman says, half-joking, that unlike his younger twin brothers he inherited "the right gene mix" from his mother, "a very formidable, strong survivor". His father by contrast was "a lovely, super-bright but not ambitious person" who ran a linen store in Philadelphia. "We could have been \uc2 Bed Bath & Beyond\uc2 . I don't know why not. That's the way my mind has always worked, he just had no interest. Fascinating."\par \par \uc2 My guest is not given to self-doubt.\par \par \uc2 Accepted at Yale, he phoned the dean of admissions at Harvard to parley his way in. (He was rejected.) After \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 , he joined \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2 . He always coveted the top job, but the infighting was murderous and he ended up selling the failing bank to \uc2 American Express\uc2 . He struck out on his own, co-founding \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  in 1985 with Pete Peterson, the former Lehman chairman and Nixon-era commerce secretary. Our waiter arrives bearing water. Schwarzman orders tomato and basil soup, followed by poached lobster salad. I choose smoked salmon and grilled Dover sole off the bone. Alcohol is out because I am on dry August and my guest says he only drinks wine sparingly. (Schwarzman takes an anticoagulant pill a day to ward off phlebitis, a vein inflammation that killed his grandfather.) \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  started as a boutique advisory firm, with the goal of making enough money to start its own private equity fund. Private equity has attracted controversy because of alleged asset-stripping: buying companies, loading them with debt ("leverage") and selling them off at a handsome profit, with favourable tax treatment.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman casts himself as a longterm investor, not a scavenger in sheep's clothing. He recounts with gusto the megadeals and the risk-taking involved in picking the right time to buy and sell assets, ranging from US Steel's railroad network to the Waldorf hotel.\par \par \uc2 His skill is market timing. \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  has expanded into real estate and hedge funds and other "alternative assets", with $545bn under management today. \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  funds are also the largest owner of real estate in the world. The firm's rise epitomises the "buy side" revolution that favours asset managers at the expense of traditional banks trading liquid securities.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman has written a book, which is part memoir, part \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  management primer called What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence. (A better title would be Whatever It Takes, I suggest.) There are many valuable insights; perhaps the biggest is the list of endorsements featuring Henry Kissinger, \uc2 Eric Schmidt\uc2 , the ex-\uc2 Google\uc2  chairman, \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2 , the ex-Fed chair, and \uc2 Mark Carney\uc2 , governor of the Bank of England.\par \par \uc2 Peterson and Schwarzman worked together for 33 years, but the father-son relationship fell apart at the end. Peterson felt he had been squeezed out of his fair share of an expanding business. Schwarzman argued that he was the rainmaker, the firm was hiring more people and something had to give. "He had reached a different stage in his career and he volunteered to reduce his interest in the firm and did."\par \par \uc2 This is the unsentimental side of Schwarzman. He appears not to care. He prides himself on his intuition (\uc2 Blackstone\uc2  went public ahead of the Great Crash in 2008 and, with fresh capital, positioned itself perfectly for the rebound). He also highlights his ability to recruit and retain high-quality executives such as \uc2 Tony James\uc2 , his longtime number two, and \uc2 Jon Gray\uc2 , the real estate guru, both fellow billionaires.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  is a meritocracy, he says, where two iron rules apply: no internal politics and do not lose money. "I go from the premise that anybody of talent does not want necessarily to be a private in an army. The lowest they want is to be a lieutenant colonel and preferably they'd all like to be generals."\par \par \uc2 Hang on, I say, there's no mistaking who's generalissimo at \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 . Schwarzman still signs all cheques above $250,000, retains a veto on major decisions and later declares: "I don't think I'll ever retire. My grandfather never did."\par \par \uc2 Anyway, surely someone loses money some time, I add.\par \par \uc2 He half-concedes the point: "Every once in a while there's some weird fucking thing where government does something or there's a technological breakthrough that's transformative that a reasonable person couldn't know what is going to happen. And so that introduces what I call unpredictable risk, and you can get, potentially, picked off by that."\par \par \uc2 I ask Schwarzman how his lobster tastes. "Pretty good," he replies, picking at the pink flesh. My Dover sole is fresh and tasty. So how does Schwarzman assess the state of modern capitalism? "Well, I would answer that with another question: what's the state of modern politics?" The "rejiggering" of governments in the west, he argues, is a legacy of the financial crisis, globalisation and a massive transfer of jobs and wealth to emerging markets such as China. And that's before the impact of technology. These trends have squeezed the middle class and lower-income groups.\par \par \uc2 His remedies start with an increase in the minimum wage to about $15, up from single digits. This will destroy some jobs, but it will directly benefit 15 to 20 per cent of the population, with a knock-on effect on compensation for another 20 per cent, he argues.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman wants to dramatically improve education levels in the US. He would make teachers tax exempt so as to raise wages and create "a new privileged class". Two-thirds of America's workforce went to high school or less, he says. "This is not the workforce of the future."\par \par \uc2 Finally, he would encourage the Baby Boom generation that's retiring to take up jobs as mentors and assistant teachers. (In a pre-lunch gesture, he offered to donate all book proceeds to Lucy Kellaway's like-minded charity, Now Teach. The offer was accepted.) How about the mega rich paying more taxes? Schwarzman looks incredulous. "Taxes on the wealthy?" Well, why not? "The tax system in the US is extremely progressive ... it's a reverse pyramid. The top 10 per cent pays 70 per cent [of the tax take]. The top 1 per cent pays 38 to 40. I pay around 48 to 47 per cent tax rate." (He later clarifies this is a "blended rate" covering ordinary income, capital gains and dividends.) Schwarzman can be tin-eared. He once compared a proposal to tax private equity executives selling their publicly listed stock as ordinary income to Hitler invading Poland. He says it was a private conversation, but does not deny railing against the "semi-socialist" Obama administration. Today, socialism is no longer a dirty word in the Democratic party. Is he worried about the 2020 presidential election? "The politics of anger and free things is a powerful potential elector," he says, adding that the US is more polarised than ever in his lifetime. "Vietnam was about one issue. This is much more intense, much more far-reaching."\par \par \uc2 The gravity of the conversation demands light relief, happily provided by the waiter, who congratulates Schwarzman on his choice of the upside down strawberry tart as dessert.\par \par \uc2 Waiter: "It's the new style."\par \par \uc2 LB: "New style?" Waiter: "Yes sir." LB: "What's the old style? Waiter: "A regular strawberry tart." Schwarzman won't talk on the record about \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , a wearily familiar response from chief executives, even billionaires. Yet as chairman and chief executive of Blackstone, he's running the firm while also advising Trump. He says the potential conflicts of interest are manageable, but there have been awkward moments, especially after he had to disband the chief executive panel advising Trump in the wake of far-right violence in Charlottesville in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Did Trump equivocate about the farright? "Most of us had no idea there were Nazis in America. That may mean we're naive ... We also had no idea there was something called anti-fascistas who also used violence. The whole thing was completely disorienting."\par \par \uc2 Trump, he concludes, did not get his words right first time. The second time, it "looked right". By the third time, the US had experienced "a societygalvanising moment".\par \par \uc2 S chwarzman has been accused of wearing too many hats. In China, where \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  has important business, he's tried to be a bridge builder; but he agrees that relations between Beijing and the US are at a low point.\par \par \uc2 "China has enjoyed the most stunning transformation in the past 40 years of any country, most probably, in world history. It did it through a variety of mechanisms that are not consistent with the rules and regulations of the developed world."\par \par \uc2 Now, in effect, the US is asking Beijing to adopt western practices. This, he admits, is very difficult. But, he suggests, the Chinese leadership has been told that however difficult they think Trump is, the Democrats could be far worse in terms of trade protectionism.\par \par \uc2 We turn to Schwarzman's generous philanthropy. In recent years, he has donated $100m to the New York Public Library, $150m to Yale, \u163\'00\'A3150m to Oxford university, $350m to MIT. He's also set up the Schwarzman scholars, a one-year masters programme on global affairs for top international students to study at \uc2 Tsinghua University in Beijing\uc2 . (Full disclosure: I have served on the 200-strong panel of judges for the past four years.) Schwarzman says he only wants to donate to causes that are "paradigm shifting", such as the \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  lab at MIT. But he is a hard-boiled negotiator when it comes to disbursing money and naming rights. \uc2 The New York Public Library\uc2  became so frustrated that they proposed putting his name on the roof (that way his name would be seen by every plane flying over Manhattan to La Guardia). The funds came through. (Schwarzman's name is now on every entrance to its main building.) The ego has landed in many other prestigious locations. His 60th birthday party in 2007, featuring Rod Stewart in Manhattan's Armory, was reported to have closed Park Avenue ("It was only one lane," he protests). His 70th was an equally extravagant affair with an ancient Silk Road theme held at a fivestar hotel near President Trump's Mara-Lago estate in Florida. Why is glitz and showiness so integral to \uc2 Steve Schwarzman\uc2 ? "That's a good question," he says, attributing his aesthetic taste partly to his second wife, Christine. "I like generally doing things that nobody has done. I also like to do things that are beautiful."\par \par \uc2 He points to the striking glass sculpture in the Foyer, with writhing snakes hanging like a chandelier. This was part of the refurbishment of Claridge's, a trophy picked up when \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  bought the \uc2 Savoy Group\uc2  21 years ago. "I actually went out to the state of Washington and met with the sculptor Dale Chihuly to check it out."\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman wonders aloud how lucky he has been a rare moment when the scrappy self-made man lets himself go. I note that we are meeting on the 100th anniversary of the death of Andrew Carnegie, the Scottishborn steel magnate, one of the world's greatest philanthropists who gave away his entire fortune (about $300bn at today's prices).\par \par \uc2 "Do you agree with Carnegie when he said: he who dies rich dies disgraced?" Schwarzman offers a rambling answer about America's "tax infrastructure". So will he follow \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2 's rallying call to the rich to donate more than 50 per cent of their fortune to charity? (Buffett himself has gone higher, to 99 per cent). "Maybe I will, maybe I won't, but to me that's not relevant ... obviously I've given it a lot of thought and the vast amount will go to charity."\par \par \uc2 Two and a half hours have passed. I switch off the tape recorder. Schwarzman looks slightly relieved. Just as I'm preparing to settle the bill, Wall Street's arch dealmaker pulls out a copy of the FT and points to an ad highlighting the longlist of the McKinsey-FT business book of the year.\par \par \uc2 "What It Takes did not make the list. Is it really too late?"

Instead it bought a convertib le bond, a type of debt that can be repaid in stock rather than cash.\par \par \uc2 Wirecard\u8217\'20\'19s shareholders gave final approval to the transaction on Wednesday, while also formally signing a \u8220\'20\'1Cstrategic cooperation agreement\u8221\'20\'1D with SoftBank. The following day, \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  sold a new \u8364\'20\'AC900m Wirecard bond that is exchangeable for stock to a broad group of investors.\par \par \uc2 The new deal effectively means that SoftBank has taken the money it invested off the table, in what SoftBank executives described as a \u8220\'20\'1Creturn optimisation\u8221\'20\'1D measure.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank and \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  declined to comment. Wirecard did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Analysts at brokerage Stifel said that Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s deal offloads the \u8220\'20\'1Ceconomic risk\u8221\'20\'1D of the Japanese group\u8217\'20\'19s bet on Wirecard, adding that the deal effectively allows SoftBank to make good on its April commitment \u8220\'20\'1Cwithout having to provide funding\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank still has skin in the game, however, because Wirecard\u8217\'20\'19s shares have rallied strongly since it announced the deal. The Japanese group has retained exposure to 3m shares \u8212\'20\'14 now worth around \u8364\'20\'AC450m \u8212\'20\'14 and can also profit on a further 3.9m shares up to a price of around \u8364\'20\'AC230 per share. Wirecard\u8217\'20\'19s shares are currently trading at \u8364\'20\'AC149.\par \par \uc2 The Wirecard investment was made through a special fund managed by SoftBank Investment Advisers, which manages the group\u8217\'20\'19s influential $100bn Vision Fund.\par \par \uc2 Capital for the deal came from SoftBank, some of its employees and Mubadala, Abu Dhabi\u8217\'20\'19s state investment company, according to people familiar with the matter. Mubadala is the second-biggest backer of the Vision Fund after Saudi Arabia\u8217\'20\'19s Public Investment Fund. Mubadala did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 A senior SoftBank executive told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  that the Wirecard trade was inspired by \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2 , who has a record of making highly structured investments in seemingly troubled companies that then benefit from his reputation.\par \par \uc2 Mr Buffett\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway\uc2  bought $5bn of preferred equity in \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  during the height of the financial crisis, for example. This paid a hefty 10 per cent annual dividend and netted Mr Buffett billions of dollars of profit when the investment bank later bought back his stake.\par \par \uc2 The so-called \u8220\'20\'1Crepackaging\u8221\'20\'1D of SoftBank\u8217\'20\'19s convertible bond was sold to investors at less generous terms than those the Japanese group extracted from Wirecard.\par \par \uc2 While repackagings are relatively common for small deals, convertible bond investors and bankers said that it is unusual to see one conducted on such a large scale.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank frequently makes use of equity derivatives such as those seen on its Wirecard trade, often as a way of employing leverage \u8212\'20\'14 raising debt against its stakes that can be deployed on other investments. For example, a so-called \u8220\'20\'1C equity collar\u8221\'20\'1D on shares in Chinese internet giant Alibaba helped SoftBank raise the funds to buy shares in Arm, the UK chip designer, before a takeover bid in 2016.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank took profit on its Wirecard trade at a time when the group is coming under renewed scrutiny for its outsized bets on tech companies. Investors in SoftBank\u8217\'20\'19s Vision Fund are braced for hefty writedowns on some of its investments. One of them, WeWork, has shelved its public listing while valuations for freshly listed Uber and Slack have tumbled.\par \par \uc2 Wirecard said its cooperation agreement with SoftBank would allow both companies to \u8220\'20\'1Cpursue global growth opportunities and synergy effects, including through the SoftBank ecosystem in the fields of digital financial services, data analysis and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 *This article has been amended since original publication to clarify the potential profit SoftBank stands to make.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020190921ef9l0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

A pair of hedge-fund managers, \uc2 Lone Pine Capital\uc2  and D1 Capital Partners, led the round, with participation from \uc2 True Ventures\uc2  and other existing investors.\par \par \uc2 Sweetgreen first raised outside capital early this decade, when the food sector was gaining some traction with venture investors. Some venture capitalists had shied away from bricks-and-mortar businesses, preferring to fund startups with internet-based business models. Others saw an opportunity to fund fast-growing brands.\par \par \uc2 Yogurt shop Pinkberry Inc. and sandwich shops the Melt and \uc2 Potbelly Corp\uc2 . also raised funding around the same time, and \uc2 Blue Bottle Coffee Inc\uc2 . and Philz Coffee Inc. became popular with venture investors, drawing comparisons to the early days of \uc2 Starbucks Corp\uc2 ., when it was backed by venture capital.\par \par \uc2 A few of these companies have managed to exit. Potbelly went public in 2013, and \uc2 Nestl\u233\'00\'E9 SA{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-buys-majority-stake-in-premium-coffee-chain-blue-bottle-1505407881"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bought a majority stake in }}}\uc2  Blue Bottle in 2017. Private-equity firm Riverwood Capital invested in the Melt in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Jon Callaghan\uc2 , co-founder of \uc2 True Ventures\uc2 , invested in Blue Bottle and hopes to replicate some of that success with Sweetgreen. He acknowledged it is difficult to create a differentiated business in the food category, but he said Sweetgreen's customer loyalty and incorporation of technology distinguish it from other salad shops.\par \par \uc2 "Today's consumer really wants the brand to mean something," Mr. Callaghan said. Sweetgreen represents "incredible fidelity to the supply chain, incredible commitment to sustainability," he said.\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Neman, Sweetgreen's co-founder and chief executive, said most purchases at its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sweetgreen-salad-new-store-model-tech-incubator-11563280524"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 97 restaurants }}}\uc2  are made through its smartphone app. He said he expects that to continue when the company begins offering deliveries through its app next year.\par \par \uc2 The move will put Sweetgreen in the same category as several delivery apps that have raised venture funding, including \uc2 Postmates Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 DoorDash Inc\uc2 . However, Sweetgreen will focus on delivering its own food and will remain on Uber Eats and other delivery apps.\par \par \uc2 Sweetgreen also uses digital products to forecast sales, deploy labor and order food, Mr. Neman said. The technology is primarily driven by data and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , he said.\par \par \uc2 "We don't consider ourselves just a salad place," Mr. Neman said.\par \par \uc2 Kelly Granat, a portfolio manager at \uc2 Lone Pine Capital\uc2 , said she invested in Sweetgreen because she is optimistic about the company's growth.\par \par \uc2 "We're investing here with the hopes that this will be a public company one day," she said.\par \par \uc2 Sweetgreen plans to use the new capital to launch its app-based delivery program and to set up more designated delivery locations in office buildings. The company also plans to open new retail locations in Miami; Denver; and Austin, Texas.\par \par \uc2 The latest funding round brings the company's total amount raised to more than $500 million since it was founded in 2007. \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2  led a $200 million round last November at a $1 billion valuation. Other prior venture investors include Revolution and Collaborative Fund.\par \par \uc2 Write to Katie Roof at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:katie.roof@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 katie.roof@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20190920ef9k0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

This morning's news that Nordic Capital has sold a stake in itself should hardly surprise WSJ Pro readers. After all, firms have been selling stakes in themselves at a steady pace for years now, including recent deals involving \uc2 BC Partners\uc2 , HGGC, \uc2 GI Partners\uc2  and \uc2 Siris Capital\uc2 . But as Will Louch writes this morning, what sets the Nordic deal apart is the buyer of its stake, Ottawa Avenue Private Capital, a unit of RDV Corp., the family office of the DeVos family. Although certainly not a newcomer to private equity, Ottawa Avenue is hardly a name that commonly pops up as a buyer of GP stakes. Could this be a future source of capital for other GPs eager to sell stakes in themselves?\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports that the initial public offering of \uc2 Ping Identity Holdings\uc2  isn't just a milestone for the cybersecurity company but also for its private-equity backer \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now on to today's news...\par \par \uc2 Today's Top Stories\par \par \uc2 DeVos Family Office Enters Market for Buyout Firm Stakes\par \par \uc2 The latest deal in the booming market for private-equity firm stakes has gone to an unusual buyer: the DeVos family office.

Financial details of the transaction couldn't be learned, but the deal is expected to be made public later this week, WSJ Pro's Will Louch reports.\par \par \uc2 Ping Identity\uc2  Listing Marks IPO Milestone for \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2  Listing Marks IPO Milestone for\par \par \uc2 Ping Identity Holding Corp\uc2 .'s initial public offering {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ping-identity-listing-marks-ipo-milestone-for-vista-11568933532?mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 marked a milestone }}}\uc2  not only in the company's past three years of private-equity ownership, but also for its backer, \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2 . Ping, which made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, is the first Vista portfolio company to go public since the firm's launch in 2000, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports. The IPO valued the company at $1.16 billion, nearly double the $600 million a person familiar with the company said Vista paid for it in 2016. The shares closed at $20.11 Thursday, rising about 34% from the offer price of $15.\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 68%\par \par \uc2 The proportion of private-equity fund investors that plan to target small- to midmarket buyout funds for future investments in the asset class, according to Preqin Ltd.\par \par \uc2 Deals\par \par \uc2 Alternative funds firm \uc2 DeA Capital\uc2  and other investors have agreed to sellAcque Minerali S.r.l., also known as Lurisia, to \uc2 Coca-Cola HBC\uc2  AGfor \u8364\'20\'AC88 million ($97.2 million).

The company said the offer represents a 34% premium over its closing share price of 235 pence on Wednesday. The offer puts a value of \u163\'00\'A3261 million ($326.8 million) on the deal, the filing shows. While the company's directors intend to support the bid unanimously, it requires the assent of at least 75% of shareholders at a special meeting expected to be held in November as well as regulatory approvals, according to the filing. Based in Radnor, Pa., Lovell Minnick managed about $3.5 billion in client assets at the end of last year, according to a U.S. regulatory filing.\par \par \uc2 HarbourVest Partners\uc2  has acquired a minority stake in Mesa Natural Gas Solutions LLC for $52 million.

Blackstone in late 2015 agreed to invest $820 million into NCR after the company's effort to sell itself foundered. The New York private-equity firm sold roughly half of its NCR stake in early 2017, Dow Jones Newswires reported.\par \par \uc2 Tikehau Capital\uc2  has agreed to sell its stake in HDL Development, the holding company controlling publicly traded \uc2 Assystem Group\uc2 , in a deal that would return 2.5 times Tikehau's initial \u8364\'20\'AC40 million investment in 2013. Tikehau would receive \u8364\'20\'AC55 million in cash and 657,895 \uc2 Assystem\uc2  shares, which closed Wednesday at \u8364\'20\'AC38.70 each in Paris. At that price, the share stake is worth about \u8364\'20\'AC25.5 million.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 The Blackstone co-founder on risk-taking, Trump whispering \u8212\'20\'14 and why the rich shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t pay more tax\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Stephen Schwarzman\uc2  originally proposed lunch, he suggested two venues: Claridge\u8217\'20\'19s or St Tropez. Naively, I assumed there was a choice. A rendezvous on the C\u244\'00\'F4te d\u8217\'20\'19Azur, where Schwarzman enjoys one of his many palatial residences, was always a tad risky for a man who loves to control the situation.\par \par \uc2 Invited for 12.15pm, I spot Schwarzman standing centre stage in The Foyer & Reading Room restaurant. Short and tanned, he\u8217\'20\'19s wearing a lightly pinstriped dark suit with his favourite combination: blue-striped shirt with white collar and purple tie. He\u8217\'20\'19s put on a few pounds since he was a top runner in high school and college, but at 72 he still looks trim.\par \par \uc2 Encounters with Schwarzman are rarely dull. He\u8217\'20\'19s a combative character who, while outwardly charming, does not take kindly to criticism. We\u8217\'20\'19ve exchanged expletives in Davos and in his luxuriously appointed office at \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 , the Wall Street private equity and asset management firm he co-founded 34 years ago. But there have never been any hard feelings.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman\u8217\'20\'19s fortune (net worth about $18bn) has bought him power and influence. He\u8217\'20\'19s graduated from being a mega dealmaker to philanthropist, back channel in US-China relations and \u8220\'20\'1CTrump whisperer\u8221\'20\'1D. I want to explore these multiple roles, but also pin down why the man who has built one of the most successful financial businesses on the planet has never quite received the credit he believes he deserves.\par \par \uc2 A Wall Street rival offers a clue: \u8220\'20\'1CSteve is one of the most honest people I know. Most people lie to your face. He\u8217\'20\'19ll always tell you straight up he\u8217\'20\'19s going to screw you.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As we study our menus, I raise the character question. His restless, driven nature is legendary. \u8220\'20\'1CYes, it\u8217\'20\'19s true,\u8221\'20\'1D he admits. \u8220\'20\'1CIt goes with the territory, the person.\u8221\'20\'1D As if on cue, he announces we\u8217\'20\'19re moving table because of a cold draught, compounded by noisy neighbours.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman says, half-joking, that unlike his younger twin brothers he inherited \u8220\'20\'1Cthe right gene mix\u8221\'20\'1D from his mother, \u8220\'20\'1Ca very formidable, strong survivor\u8221\'20\'1D. His father by contrast was \u8220\'20\'1Ca lovely, super-bright but not ambitious person\u8221\'20\'1D who ran a linen store in Philadelphia. \u8220\'20\'1CWe could have been \uc2 Bed Bath & Beyond\uc2 . I don\u8217\'20\'19t know why not. That\u8217\'20\'19s the way my mind has always worked, he just had no interest. Fascinating.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 My guest is not given to self-doubt. Accepted at Yale, he phoned the dean of admissions at Harvard to parley his way in. (He was rejected.) After \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 , he joined \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2 . He always coveted the top job, but the infighting was murderous and he ended up selling the failing bank to \uc2 American Express\uc2 . He struck out on his own, co-founding \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  in 1985 with Pete Peterson, the former Lehman chairman and Nixon-era commerce secretary.\par \par \uc2 Our waiter arrives bearing water. Schwarzman orders tomato and basil soup, followed by poached lobster salad. I choose smoked salmon and grilled Dover sole off the bone. Alcohol is out because I am on dry August and my guest says he only drinks wine sparingly. (Schwarzman takes an anticoagulant pill a day to ward off phlebitis, a vein inflammation that killed his grandfather.)\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  started as a boutique advisory firm, with the goal of making enough money to start its own private equity fund. Private equity has attracted controversy because of alleged asset-stripping: buying companies, loading them with debt (\u8220\'20\'1Cleverage\u8221\'20\'1D) and selling them off at a handsome profit, with favourable tax treatment.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman casts himself as a long-term investor, not a scavenger in sheep\u8217\'20\'19s clothing. He recounts with gusto the megadeals and the risk-taking involved in picking the right time to buy and sell assets, ranging from US Steel\u8217\'20\'19s railroad network to the Waldorf hotel.\par \par \uc2 His skill is market timing. \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  has expanded into real estate and hedge funds and other \u8220\'20\'1Calternative assets\u8221\'20\'1D, with $545bn under management today. \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  funds are also the largest owner of real estate in the world. The firm\u8217\'20\'19s rise epitomises the \u8220\'20\'1Cbuy side\u8221\'20\'1D revolution that favours asset managers at the expense of traditional banks trading liquid securities.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman has written a book, which is part memoir, part \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  management primer called What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence. (A better title would be Whatever It Takes, I suggest.) There are many valuable insights; perhaps the biggest is the list of endorsements featuring Henry Kissinger, \uc2 Eric Schmidt\uc2 , the ex-\uc2 Google\uc2  chairman, \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2 , the ex-Fed chair, and \uc2 Mark Carney\uc2 , governor of the Bank of England.\par \par \uc2 Peterson and Schwarzman worked together for 33 years, but the father-son relationship fell apart at the end. Peterson felt he had been squeezed out of his fair share of an expanding business. Schwarzman argued that he was the rainmaker, the firm was hiring more people and something had to give. \u8220\'20\'1CHe had reached a different stage in his career and he volunteered to reduce his interest in the firm and did.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This is the unsentimental side of Schwarzman. He appears not to care. He prides himself on his intuition (\uc2 Blackstone\uc2  went public ahead of the Great Crash in 2008 and, with fresh capital, positioned itself perfectly for the rebound). He also highlights his ability to recruit and retain high-quality executives such as \uc2 Tony James\uc2 , his longtime number two, and \uc2 Jon Gray\uc2 , the real estate guru, both fellow billionaires.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  is a meritocracy, he says, where two iron rules apply: no internal politics and do not lose money. \u8220\'20\'1CI go from the premise that anybody of talent does not want necessarily to be a private in an army. The lowest they want is to be a lieutenant colonel and preferably they\u8217\'20\'19d all like to be generals.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Hang on, I say, there\u8217\'20\'19s no mistaking who\u8217\'20\'19s generalissimo at \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 . Schwarzman still signs all cheques above $250,000, retains a veto on major decisions and later declares: \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t think I\u8217\'20\'19ll ever retire. My grandfather never did.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Anyway, surely someone loses money some time, I add.\par \par \uc2 He half-concedes the point: \u8220\'20\'1CEvery once in a while there\u8217\'20\'19s some weird fucking thing where government does something or there\u8217\'20\'19s a technological breakthrough that\u8217\'20\'19s transformative that a reasonable person couldn\u8217\'20\'19t know what is going to happen. And so that introduces what I call unpredictable risk, and you can get, potentially, picked off by that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 I ask Schwarzman how his lobster tastes. \u8220\'20\'1CPretty good,\u8221\'20\'1D he replies, picking at the pink flesh. My Dover sole is fresh and tasty. So how does Schwarzman assess the state of modern capitalism?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWell, I would answer that with another question: what\u8217\'20\'19s the state of modern politics?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The \u8220\'20\'1Crejiggering\u8221\'20\'1D of governments in the west, he argues, is a legacy of the financial crisis, globalisation and a massive transfer of jobs and wealth to emerging markets such as China. And that\u8217\'20\'19s before the impact of technology. These trends have squeezed the middle class and lower-income groups.\par \par \uc2 His remedies start with an increase in the minimum wage to about $15, up from single digits. This will destroy some jobs, but it will directly benefit 15 to 20 per cent of the population, with a knock-on effect on compensation for another 20 per cent, he argues.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman wants to dramatically improve education levels in the US. He would make teachers tax exempt so as to raise wages and create \u8220\'20\'1Ca new privileged class\u8221\'20\'1D. Two-thirds of America\u8217\'20\'19s workforce went to high school or less, he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is not the workforce of the future.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Finally, he would encourage the Baby Boom generation that\u8217\'20\'19s retiring to take up jobs as mentors and assistant teachers. (In a pre-lunch gesture, he offered to donate all book proceeds to Lucy Kellaway\u8217\'20\'19s like-minded charity, Now Teach. The offer was accepted.)\par \par \uc2 How about the mega rich paying more taxes? Schwarzman looks incredulous. \u8220\'20\'1CTaxes on the wealthy?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Well, why not?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe tax system in the US is extremely progressive\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09it\u8217\'20\'19s a reverse pyramid. The top 10 per cent pays 70 per cent [of the tax take]. The top 1 per cent pays 38 to 40. I pay around 48 to 47 per cent tax rate.\u8221\'20\'1D (He later clarifies this is a \u8220\'20\'1Cblended rate\u8221\'20\'1D covering ordinary income, capital gains and dividends.)\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman can be tin-eared. He once compared a proposal to tax private equity executives selling their publicly listed stock as ordinary income to Hitler invading Poland. He says it was a private conversation, but does not deny railing against the \u8220\'20\'1Csemi-socialist\u8221\'20\'1D Obama administration. Today, socialism is no longer a dirty word in the Democratic party. Is he worried about the 2020 presidential election?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe politics of anger and free things is a powerful potential elector,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, adding that the US is more polarised than ever in his lifetime. \u8220\'20\'1CVietnam was about one issue. This is much more intense, much more far-reaching.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The gravity of the conversation demands light relief, happily provided by the waiter, who congratulates Schwarzman on his choice of the upside down strawberry tart as dessert.\par \par \uc2 Waiter: \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s the new style.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 LB: \u8220\'20\'1CNew style?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Waiter: \u8220\'20\'1CYes sir.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 LB: \u8220\'20\'1CWhat\u8217\'20\'19s the old style?\par \par \uc2 Waiter: \u8220\'20\'1CA regular strawberry tart.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman won\u8217\'20\'19t talk on the record about \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , a wearily familiar response from chief executives, even billionaires. Yet as chairman and chief executive of Blackstone, he\u8217\'20\'19s running the firm while also advising Trump. He says the potential conflicts of interest are manageable, but there have been awkward moments, especially after he had to disband the chief executive panel advising Trump in the wake of far-right violence in Charlottesville in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Did Trump equivocate about the far-right? \u8220\'20\'1CMost of us had no idea there were Nazis in America. That may mean we\u8217\'20\'19re naive\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09We also had no idea there was something called anti-fascistas who also used violence. The whole thing was completely disorienting.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Trump, he concludes, did not get his words right first time. The second time, it \u8220\'20\'1Clooked right\u8221\'20\'1D. By the third time, the US had experienced \u8220\'20\'1Ca society-galvanising moment\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman has been accused of wearing too many hats. In China, where \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  has important business, he\u8217\'20\'19s tried to be a bridge builder; but he agrees that relations between Beijing and the US are at a low point.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CChina has enjoyed the most stunning transformation in the past 40 years of any country, most probably, in world history. It did it through a variety of mechanisms that are not consistent with the rules and regulations of the developed world.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Now, in effect, the US is asking Beijing to adopt western practices. This, he admits, is very difficult. But, he suggests, the Chinese leadership has been told that however difficult they think Trump is, the Democrats could be far worse in terms of trade protectionism.\par \par \uc2 We turn to Schwarzman\u8217\'20\'19s generous philanthropy. In recent years, he has donated $100m to the New York Public Library, $150m to Yale, \u163\'00\'A3150m to Oxford university, $350m to MIT. He\u8217\'20\'19s also set up the Schwarzman scholars, a one-year masters programme on global affairs for top international students to study at \uc2 Tsinghua University in Beijing\uc2 . (Full disclosure: I have served on the 200-strong panel of judges for the past four years.)\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman says he only wants to donate to causes that are \u8220\'20\'1Cparadigm shifting\u8221\'20\'1D, such as the \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  lab at MIT. But he is a hard-boiled negotiator when it comes to disbursing money and naming rights. \uc2 The New York Public Library\uc2  became so frustrated that they proposed putting his name on the roof (that way his name would be seen by every plane flying over Manhattan to La Guardia). The funds came through. (Schwarzman\u8217\'20\'19s name is now on every entrance to its main building.)\par \par \uc2 The ego has landed in many other prestigious locations. His 60th birthday party in 2007, featuring Rod Stewart in Manhattan\u8217\'20\'19s Armory, was reported to have closed Park Avenue (\u8220\'20\'1CIt was only one lane,\u8221\'20\'1D he protests). His 70th was an equally extravagant affair with an ancient Silk Road theme held at a five-star hotel near President Trump\u8217\'20\'19s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\par \par \uc2 Why is glitz and showiness so integral to \uc2 Steve Schwarzman\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s a good question,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, attributing his aesthetic taste partly to his second wife, Christine. \u8220\'20\'1CI like generally doing things that nobody has done. I also like to do things that are beautiful.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He points to the striking glass sculpture in the Foyer, with writhing snakes hanging like a chandelier. This was part of the refurbishment of Claridge\u8217\'20\'19s, a trophy picked up when \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  bought the \uc2 Savoy Group\uc2  21 years ago. \u8220\'20\'1CI actually went out to the state of Washington and met with the sculptor Dale Chihuly to check it out.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman wonders aloud how lucky he has been \u8212\'20\'14 a rare moment when the scrappy self-made man lets himself go. I note that we are meeting on the 100th anniversary of the death of Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-born steel magnate, one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s greatest philanthropists who gave away his entire fortune (about $300bn at today\u8217\'20\'19s prices).\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDo you agree with Carnegie when he said: he who dies rich dies disgraced?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Schwarzman offers a rambling answer about America\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Ctax infrastructure\u8221\'20\'1D. So will he follow \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s rallying call to the rich to donate more than 50 per cent of their fortune to charity? (Buffett himself has gone higher, to 99 per cent). \u8220\'20\'1CMaybe I will, maybe I won\u8217\'20\'19t, but to me that\u8217\'20\'19s not relevant\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09obviously I\u8217\'20\'19ve given it a lot of thought and the vast amount will go to charity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Two and a half hours have passed. I switch off the tape recorder. Schwarzman looks slightly relieved.\par \par \uc2 Just as I\u8217\'20\'19m preparing to settle the bill, Wall Street\u8217\'20\'19s arch dealmaker pulls out a copy of the FT and points to an ad highlighting the longlist of the McKinsey-FT business book of the year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat It Takes did not make the list.

We report on new funds from five firms in today's newsletter, demonstrating the breadth of the venture industry's reach and its continued ability to raise more capital.\par \par \uc2 Data Collective raised $725 million to invest in deep technology-related startups, while publicly traded \uc2 Splunk Inc\uc2 . launched a corporate venture arm called Splunk Ventures with two funds: a $100 million Innovation Fund and a $50 million social impact fund.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Revolution Ventures closed its latest $215 million fund to invest in startups outside of the main coastal tech centers. Afore Capital raised a $77 million second fund to invest in pre-seed rounds, the latest iteration in venture capital as seed funds get larger and become more commonplace. And Vertex Ventures SEA & India raised $305 million for deals in Asia.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 SoftBank's New York move. \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . plans to open a New York office for its Vision Fund, marking the global investor's fifth base of operations and positioning it to tap more actively into the city's startup scene, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-vision-fund-to-open-new-york-office-11568838843?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * The New York office will open soon, according to Lydia Jett, a SoftBank partner, who was speaking Wednesday at a conference in the city hosted by seed firm Primary Venture Partners. It isn't clear who will lead the new office or when it will open. Ms. Jett declined to comment further.\par \par \uc2 * The first Vision Fund has invested in several New York companies, including real-estate companies \uc2 We Co\uc2 ., which this week postponed its IPO plans, and Compass, which raised $370 million in July.\par \par \uc2 * A New York office would expand the fund's global network of outposts beyond its current offices in London; San Carlos, Calif.; Tokyo; and Singapore.\par \par \uc2 * Further investment by SoftBank in New York would accelerate a fast-growing venture investment scene in the city. Startups in New York have raised more than $13 billion in venture capital so far this year, almost as much as in all of 2018, according to a report by Primary Venture Partners.\par \par \uc2 Undruggable no more. Seed investors are backing a startup that sees \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  as the key to enabling drugs aimed at molecular targets that have long been thought to be out of pharmaceutical companies' reach, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-aims-to-unlock-drug-discovery-with-machine-learning-11568823688?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports }}}\uc2 . Unnatural Products Inc. secured more than $6 million in seed financing to fund its mission of solving the problem of "undruggable" proteins\u8212\'20\'14the roughly 80% to 90% of proteins in the body that have eluded drugmakers. Molecules called macrocycles have shown the ability to disrupt protein-protein interactions, but drug developers historically have needed some serendipity to identify ideal macrocycle drugs. Using \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Santa Cruz, Calif.-based Unnatural seeks to optimize macrocycles to turn them into effective medicines.\par \par \uc2 Own together. Some well-funded startups have an unusual pitch for homeowners strapped for cash: Let's own this house together. A handful of companies, including those backed by marquee Silicon Valley names such as \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  and Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, are experimenting with a product that essentially lets them take an ownership position in a house along with the homeowner, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-explores-a-new-investment-your-home-1518955201?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Peter Rudegeair and Christina Rexrode write for the Journal }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 More scrutiny. Foreign investors who want to put money into U.S. businesses that rely on sensitive technology, infrastructure and data could face greater national-security scrutiny under proposed rules released by the Trump administration, the Journal's Katy Stech Ferek reports. Treasury Department officials provided a first glimpse of how they would implement Congress's order last year to expand the scope of national-security reviews of foreign investment deals, including those involving satellites, oil refineries, financial-market systems and drinking water utilities.\par \par \uc2 Subpoena time. The leader of a House committee investigating \uc2 Juul Labs Inc\uc2 . said the e-cigarette maker has failed to turn over documents it requested and warned that the committee could issue a subpoena demanding them, the Journal's Micah Maidenberg reports.\par \par \uc2 Tencent backs VIPKid. Chinese technology giant \uc2 Tencent Holdings Ltd\uc2 . is set to invest $150 million in VIPKid, Julie Steinberg and Shan Li report for WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter, pushing a funding round closer to completion even amid concerns among some investors over the Chinese online education company's business model.\par \par \uc2 Nielsen bets on brand safety. \uc2 Nielsen Holdings PLC\uc2  has acquired a minority stake in venture-backed brand-safety measurement company OpenSlate in an effort to help marketers avoid advertising in environments that don't fit their desired image, WSJ's Sahil Patel reports for CMO Today.\par \par \uc2 Women in Venture Capital Nominations\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Venture Capital is accepting nominations for our upcoming Women to Watch list. Each year, this list highlights some of the outstanding women influencing private-equity deal making, fundraising and portfolio management.

Many businesses enlist Ping to help modernize their identity security infrastructure, according to founder and Chief Executive Andre Durand.\par \par \uc2 Under Vista's ownership, Ping expanded its reach and product offerings through two acquisitions. In 2016, it bought \uc2 UnboundID\uc2 , a customer-identity and access-management software company. Two years later, its acquisition of Elastic Beam broadened Ping's reach into the \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  world by acquiring a product that uses AI to identify and block cyberattacks.\par \par \uc2 The company's annual revenue rose 17% to $201.6 million last year from $172.5 million in 2017, according to a filing with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Durand said that Ping decided to pursue a possible public offering about a year to a year-and-a-half ago.\par \par \uc2 "Vista appreciated how important Ping was to the enterprises we were serving," said Mr. Durand, adding that it was at that time the company and its private-equity backer talked about growing through an IPO.\par \par \uc2 Vista built a strong record exiting portfolio companies through sales to strategic buyers or to other private-equity firms. The firm had previously planned another IPO on the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  three years ago with \uc2 Misys Group Ltd\uc2 ., a financial services software provider, but later {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/misys-scraps-london-ipo-1477585989"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 scrapped those plans }}}\uc2  because of to market conditions.

At the same time, new regulations stemming from the \uc2 EU\uc2  and which have washed over the US have required banks to charge investors for the research they provide, rather than bundling the cost into commissions for trading.\par \par \uc2 As a result, fund managers have slashed budgets for spending on research, spurring banks to look for new opportunities in the corporate world.\par \par \uc2 Simon Bound, global head of research at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , said: "The catalyst is pressure on the overall business. These are incremental dollars we didn't think about before, that we are now trying to bring into the firm."\par \par \uc2 The motivation is somewhat different at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , where chief executive \uc2 David Solomon\uc2  has been aiming to build relationships with executives at smaller companies, hoping that they can boost the bank's investment banking revenues.\par \par \uc2 Steve Strongin\uc2 , the bank's global head of research, said: "The shift is very real. There is a broader recognition that research can be useful to our clients ... beyond the investment industry."\par \par \uc2 Research divisions within banks often have staffing and resources that dwarf the biggest think-tanks and consultancies, churning out huge amounts of industry, economic and financial research, from simple stock recommendations to \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 -driven analyses of corporate sentiment. Total commissions paid by US fund managers, covering both research and trading, came to almost $8bn last year, according to \uc2 Greenwich Associates\uc2 , down from a peak of $14bn in 2009.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020190919ef9j00099\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

It is a rival to Berlin-based Raisin, which, among other investors, is backed by \uc2 PayPal\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Deposit Solution's valuation more than doubled since its last financing round in August 2018, when it raised $100m from Munich-based private equity group \uc2 Vitruvian Partners\uc2  and other investors.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 , which also owns stakes in financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  start-up Finanzguru, the transaction is the largest fintech investment in its history.

Its software is at the core of \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 's "Zinspilot", a tool that Deutsche's 7m retail customers in Germany can use to funnel savings to third-parties such as real estate lender Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and Cerberus-owned My Money Bank.\par \par \uc2 Germany's largest lender is planning to roll out the \uc2 Deposit Solutions\uc2  software to the 13m clients of its Postbank brand, its 4m retail clients outside Germany, as well as its small business and wealth management customers.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020190919ef9j0008p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

What is the safest way to store digital currencies? The answer to that question could decide the biggest winners in a multibillion-dollar race to determine what companies will be the leading custodians of cryptocurrencies, which are increasingly being used by money managers and other institutions for themselves or their clients, WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron reports. As with traditional assets, such as stocks, bonds or gold, SEC-registered investment advisers are required by law, with certain exceptions, to hold assets with a qualified custodian, a specialized financial firm that holds a customer's assets separate from the customer's financial manager or brokerage firm. For cryptocurrencies, the role of custodian is especially important, since all a thief or hacker needs to steal cryptocurrency is the string of private keys, or codes, assigned to that specific asset.\par \par \uc2 French unicorns. French insurers and asset managers have pledged \u8364\'20\'AC5 billion in investment for homegrown tech firms as part of President Emmanuel Macron's push to nurture France's fledgling startups into a cohort of highly valued heavyweights, the Journal's Noemie Bisserbe reports.

So far it has backed two deals from the new fund: Definitive Healthcare LLC, a U.S. health-care data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company; and payment solutions provider Transaction Service Group.\par \par \uc2 To help source deals, Advent said it has opened a new office in Palo Alto, Calif., and added seven new professionals to its tech team. The new hires bring the team to 20 professionals, including former TPG Partner Bryan Taylor, who joined Advent in February. Advent said it plans to add more people to the team in the coming months.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the new Palo Alto office, the firm also has tech-focused deal makers in its London and New York offices.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 1984, Advent is one of the world's largest private-equity firms. The firm has invested in more than 345 private-equity transactions in 41 countries. It had $54 billion in assets under management as of June 30.\par \par \uc2 Write to Will Louch at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:william.louch@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 william.louch@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20190918ef9i0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 WSJ Pro\par {\*\bkmkstart toc16}{\*\bkmkend toc16}\b \uc2 Cyber Daily: Caution About Multifactor Authentication; Smart Cities Invite Smart Hacking\b0\par\par\uc2 1,694 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2019\par 13:36\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Cybersecurity\par \uc2 RSTPROCY\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2019, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 Good day. Security experts advise multifactor authentication to protect employee and customer accounts, as well as to access sensitive data and systems. But the technique comes with pitfalls, reports Adam Janofsky of WSJ Pro. Companies should streamline how they use such authentication to avoid hurting productivity.\par \par \uc2 Don't miss: Smart cities\u8212\'20\'14decked out in sensors from lampposts to waste-management systems\u8212\'20\'14could become a hacker's paradise, WSJ Pro's James Rundle reports. City planners are working to build cybersecurity protections from the start.\par \par \uc2 Also today: Edward Snowden's new book and new asylum request; surveillance systems around the globe; and medical data online for the taking.\par \par \uc2 Smart Cities are Coming. Hackers Won't Be Far Behind\par \par \uc2 Smart cities are collecting data about public utilities, traffic, garbage collecting, road conditions and much more, and then using that data to deliver services to more people and more efficiently. But the more connected a city is, the more vulnerable it is to cyberattacks, reports WSJ Pro's James Rundle.\par \par \uc2 As additional information on residents is collected, officials worry the resulting reams of data could attract nation-states or terrorists who could incorporate the data into physical and cyberwarfare campaigns.\par \par \uc2 What are the most vulnerable places in a smart city?\par \par \uc2 Sensors. The potential for harm is pretty much endless. Hackers could, for instance, either create erroneous data or obscure real information about the integrity of bridges, divert emergency services to nonexistent floods or corrupt information about air quality, instigating false alarms.\par \par \uc2 Energy and water-supply systems. Malicious software could disable power plants, for instance, as was seen during the spread of the NotPetya malware in 2017 that struck Ukraine, before spreading throughout the world. More than 225,000 people were left without power. The ubiquity of smart meters also means the possible points of entry into the network number in the thousands. Once a utility's system is attacked, it's hard to turn it off and look for the problem.\par \par \uc2 Autonomous vehicles. Terrorists have shown how manned vehicles can drive into busy streets, causing mass casualties. That becomes even easier, and exponentially more dangerous, if a single hacker can take control of multiple driverless cars. Hackers could also could reroute vehicles carrying people targeted for abduction. Specialists at hacker conferences have repeatedly demonstrated how the onboard systems of such vehicles can be compromised.

With multifactor\u8212\'20\'14typically two-factor\u8212\'20\'14authentication enabled, users are prompted to enter an additional piece of information before they gain access to an account. Often this is a code sent as a text message, email or push notification to their phones.\par \par \uc2 This basic step can block most account-compromise attacks\u8212\'20\'14in some cases close to 100% of these incidents\u8212\'20\'14according to separate reports released recently by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Multifactor authentication is the kryptonite to most cyberattacks," said Kevin Richards, global head of cyber risk consulting at the Marsh brokerage unit of \uc2 Marsh & McLennan Cos\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Despite the benefits, just 30% of people use multifactor authentication to log into accounts, according to a poll of 1,223 adults in the U.S. published Tuesday by \uc2 Chubb Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Not all forms of multifactor authentication are created equal, and companies can fail to reap the benefits if they aren't careful. For example, authenticator apps\u8212\'20\'14which send users a code through the app, not over a cellular network\u8212\'20\'14and hardware tokens are more secure than text-message codes sent to smartphones. Codes sent to phones, meanwhile, are more secure than knowledge-based authentication techniques that ask a user for information that only he or she should know, according to research from \uc2 Google\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Factors Matter\par \par \uc2 A study by researchers from \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 New York University\uc2  that was published in May evaluated how effective 14 secondary authentication factors were in preventing more than 350,000 real-world account hijacking attempts.\par \par \uc2 Knowledge-based challenges, such as asking users to recall the name of the street they grew up on, prevented as little as 10% of phishing attempts, the study found. This form of two-factor authentication is weak because answers can be extracted in data breaches or dug up online, and many users forget the response they originally selected, said Periwinkle Doerfler, an NYU doctoral student in computer science and a co-author of the study.\par \par \uc2 "These are terrible for an added layer of security. People don't remember how to answer these questions," she said.\par \par \uc2 At the other end of the spectrum, text-message-based authentication blocked 96% of phishing attempts examined in the study. Security keys, which look like USB flash drives and are inserted into a device as a second form of authentication, blocked 100% of these attempts, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 Although text-message-based authentication is widely used, the codes have to go through a cellular network, which introduces risks, Ms. Doerfler said. One example, known as SIM swapping, involves fraudsters tricking a mobile carrier into assigning a victim's phone number to a new device that they control.\par \par \uc2 Even technology companies get this wrong. \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 , Twitter Inc.'s chief executive, got caught up in a SIM-swapping attack in August when hackers took advantage of a mobile carrier weakness to hijack his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account and post obscene messages.\par \par \uc2 "The phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider," the company said in a statement. "This allowed an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number."\par \par \uc2 Don't Overdo It\par \par \uc2 There are downsides to using multifactor authentication extensively, cybersecurity experts say.\par \par \uc2 Adding an extra step to the log-in process can irritate employees and in some cases prevent them from getting work done. According to \uc2 Google\uc2 's research, adding a second authentication factor leads to 52% of legitimate users having difficulty signing in.\par \par \uc2 "Multifactor authentication can be rather annoying, and businesses have to take that into account when implementing it," said Steve Durbin, managing director of the Information Security Forum.\par \par \uc2 To get around this, companies should consider using multifactor authentication only on their most sensitive data and accounts, Mr. Durbin said. Users also can be prompted to enter a second factor only if the system recognizes a discrepancy, such as a login from a new location or device.\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 49%\par \par \uc2 Percentage of adults who share at least one password with someone else, according to a \uc2 Chubb Ltd\uc2 . survey of 1,223 adults in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 More Cyber News\par \par \uc2 World catching up with China on surveillance tech. China leads the world in facial-recognition and other new surveillance technologies, with its own government using the tools at home and Huawei Technologies Co.exporting them globally, according to a new report by the \uc2 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\uc2 . But other countries are adopting similar technologies, according to the think tank's report, which is based on research by a former State Department official in the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 Surveilling citizens: At least 75 countries, including the U.S., Brazil and Singapore, host \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to surveil citizens, the report said\u8212\'20\'14a wider footprint than previously documented, The Wall Street Journal reports. The top U.S. firm identified in the report was \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 ., which sold surveillance technology in 11 countries. \uc2 IBM\uc2  and Huawei didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Medical images, data for millions of Americans available online.X-rays, scans and medical information about five million American patients reside unprotected online, according to \uc2 ProPublica\uc2  in an investigation with German public broadcaster \uc2 Bayerischer Rundfunk\uc2 . The outlets identified 187 servers without safeguards in doctors' offices and other health-care locations. \uc2 ProPublica\uc2  said it uncovered no evidence the data was copied or published elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 U.S. sues Snowden over new book. The \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  on Tuesday filed a civil lawsuit against Edward Snowden, arguing the former intelligence contractor violated government nondisclosure agreements by publishing a new book about his 2013 leaks of classified surveillance programs, the Journal reports. The suit doesn't seek to prevent the distribution or sale of the book, "Permanent Record"\u8212\'20\'14which could run afoul of First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech. Rather, the government is asking a court to seize the financial proceeds from the sale of the book as well as to enjoin Mr. Snowden from giving speeches related to the book.\par \par \uc2 No secrets? "This book contains no government secrets that have not been previously published by respected news organizations," said Ben Wizner, an attorney for Mr. Snowden who runs \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 's speech, privacy and technology project. Macmillan, part of Germany's Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, referred to ACLU's statement and declined further comment.\par \par \uc2 Tweet: In a tweet, Mr. Snowden noted the lawsuit over his book, and then linked to the \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2  listing for his memoir, saying: "This is the book the government does not want you to read."\par \par \uc2 C'est la vie: Meanwhile, Mr. Snowden wants to move to France. Mr. Snowden is calling on French President Emmanuel Macron to give him asylum, the Associated Press reports. Mr. Snowden has been living in Russia since 2013 when he was denied asylum in France under then-president Francois Hollande. Mr. Macron's office didn't comment.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  removes Iraq, Ukraine accounts displaying \u8216\'20\'18inauthentic' behavior. \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . detected two separate campaigns of "coordinated, inauthentic behavior" on its platform linked to Iraq and Ukraine, the company said.

At the same time, new regulations stemming from the \uc2 EU\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 and which have washed over the US \u8212\'20\'14 have required banks to charge investors for the research they provide, rather than bundling the cost into commissions for trading.\par \par \uc2 As a result, fund managers have slashed budgets for spending on research, spurring banks to look for new opportunities in the corporate world.\par \par \uc2 Simon Bound, global head of research at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe catalyst is pressure on the overall business. These are incremental dollars we didn\u8217\'20\'19t think about before, that we are now trying to bring into the firm.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The motivation is somewhat different at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , where chief executive \uc2 David Solomon\uc2  has been aiming to build relationships with executives at smaller companies, hoping that they can boost the bank\u8217\'20\'19s investment banking revenues.\par \par \uc2 Steve Strongin\uc2 , the bank\u8217\'20\'19s global head of research, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe shift is very real. There is a broader recognition that research can be useful to our clients\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09beyond the investment industry.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Research divisions within banks often have staffing and resources that dwarf the biggest think tanks and consultancies, churning out huge amounts of industry, economic and financial research, from simple stock recommendations to \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 -driven analyses of corporate sentiment. Total commissions paid by US fund managers, covering both research and trading, came to almost $8bn last year, according to \uc2 Greenwich Associates\uc2 , down from a peak of $14bn in 2009.\par \par \uc2 But the banks\u8217\'20\'19 analysts are mostly trained to service that investment industry, which is looking for specific advice on trading strategies. That means the banks are having to recast their research to be more digestible to senior executives, creating research that is much broader in nature \u8212\'20\'14 akin to that produced by consultancies such as Bain or BCG.\par \par \uc2 But the biggest hurdle is simply getting banks\u8217\'20\'19 research products into the right hands.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Mr Bound said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe challenge is distribution. We\u8217\'20\'19re set up to distribute research to asset managers, hedge funds and wealth managers, not corporate [clients]. But it will be hand-to-hand combat. You need salespeople to connect with those corporate clients.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Joyce Chang, global head of research at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , said that universal banks with large commercial operations \u8212\'20\'14 such as \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  or Citi \u8212\'20\'14 have been marketing research services to corporate clients for a while.\par \par \uc2 However, the bank last year launched a new research product called JPMorgan Perspectives that is more thematic and targeted at a general corporate readership, often picking up topics discussed by chief executive \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  in his capacity as chair of the Business Roundtable, a powerful lobby group.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI do get a lot more calls from corporate clients on some issues, but it tends to evolve,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms Chang said. \u8220\'20\'1CDodd-Frank [post-crisis regulatory reform] was a big thing for a period, and these days it is more about ESG and climate change. And everyone always wants to talk about China.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020190918ef9i0025t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

At the same time, new regulations stemming from the \uc2 EU\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 and which have washed over the US \u8212\'20\'14 have required banks to charge investors for the research they provide, rather than bundling the cost into commissions for trading.\par \par \uc2 As a result, fund managers have slashed budgets for spending on research, spurring banks to look for new opportunities in the corporate world.\par \par \uc2 Simon Bound, global head of research at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe catalyst is pressure on the overall business. These are incremental dollars we didn\u8217\'20\'19t think about before, that we are now trying to bring into the firm.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The motivation is somewhat different at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , where chief executive \uc2 David Solomon\uc2  has been aiming to build relationships with executives at smaller companies, hoping that they can boost the bank\u8217\'20\'19s investment banking revenues.\par \par \uc2 Steve Strongin\uc2 , the bank\u8217\'20\'19s global head of research, said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe shift is very real. There is a broader recognition that research can be useful to our clients\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09beyond the investment industry.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Research divisions within banks often have staffing and resources that dwarf the biggest think tanks and consultancies, churning out huge amounts of industry, economic and financial research, from simple stock recommendations to \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 -driven analyses of corporate sentiment. Total commissions paid by US fund managers, covering both research and trading, came to almost $8bn last year, according to \uc2 Greenwich Associates\uc2 , down from a peak of $14bn in 2009.\par \par \uc2 But the banks\u8217\'20\'19 analysts are mostly trained to service that investment industry, which is looking for specific advice on trading strategies. That means the banks are having to recast their research to be more digestible to senior executives, creating research that is much broader in nature \u8212\'20\'14 akin to that produced by consultancies such as Bain or BCG.\par \par \uc2 But the biggest hurdle is simply getting banks\u8217\'20\'19 research products into the right hands.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Mr Bound said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe challenge is distribution. We\u8217\'20\'19re set up to distribute research to asset managers, hedge funds and wealth managers, not corporate [clients]. But it will be hand-to-hand combat. You need salespeople to connect with those corporate clients.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Joyce Chang, chair of research at JPMorgan, said that universal banks with large commercial operations \u8212\'20\'14 such as \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  or Citi \u8212\'20\'14 have been marketing research services to corporate clients for a while.\par \par \uc2 However, the bank last year launched a new research product called JPMorgan Perspectives that is more thematic and targeted at a general corporate readership, often picking up topics discussed by chief executive \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  in his capacity as chair of the Business Roundtable, a powerful lobby group.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI do get a lot more calls from corporate clients on some issues, but it tends to evolve,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms Chang said. \u8220\'20\'1CDodd-Frank [post-crisis regulatory reform] was a big thing for a period, and these days it is more about ESG and climate change. And everyone always wants to talk about China.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020190918ef9i0028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

WeWork's parent company is expected to postpone its initial public offering until October, in the latest blow to the highly anticipated listing, WSJ's Maureen Farrell reports.\par \par \uc2 Investors have questioned WeWork's valuation and its corporate governance. The company had been planning to begin its roadshow to market the offering this week.\par \par \uc2 It's the latest bad news for SoftBank, which is a major investor in WeWork and is seeking to raise a second massive fund.\par \par \uc2 What will be the impact for other venture-backed companies planning to go public? Other startups will be hoping that any problems stemming from the many unique features of WeWork and its offering won't affect other well-positioned IPOs. Let's wait and see.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Another VC split. The founders of Aspect Ventures, a prominent female-led venture firm, are parting ways to launch separate firms, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-firm-aspect-ventures-breaking-up-11568665236?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports }}}\uc2 . Jennifer Fonstad, who focused on digital health and enterprise software, is creating \uc2 Owl Capital\uc2  to invest in early-stage deals, and \uc2 Theresia Gouw\uc2 , named by Forbes last year as the wealthiest female venture investor, is setting up her own early-stage firm called Acrew.\par \par \uc2 * Acrew aims to raise about $175 million. \uc2 Owl Capital\uc2  hopes to raise around $125 million.\par \par \uc2 * "We saw very much eye to eye in terms of our investments and strategy. But we had very different leadership styles and different ways of operating at the portfolio level," Ms. Fonstad said of the moves, adding that she wanted to run a small, boutique firm.\par \par \uc2 * Other well-known venture firms have disbanded in recent years. \uc2 Mary Meeker\uc2  recently left \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2  to set up her own growth fund. Several years ago, Formation 8 split up into several firms, including Joe Lonsdale's 8VC.\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 Owl Capital\uc2  is bringing on Niloofar Razi Howe, a former executive at cybersecurity companies RSA Security and Endgame Inc., as an investor. Other Aspect team members joining Ms. Fonstad will be Chad Herrin and Rebecca Hu.\par \par \uc2 * Several Aspect team members are expected to join Ms. Gouw, including Lauren Kolodny, who led the firm's Series A investment in mobile bank Chime, among other deals, and Vishal Lugani, who co-led or worked with PredictHQ Ltd., Pie Insurance Holdings Inc. and others.\par \par \uc2 Banks bet on identity verification startup. Several Wall Street banks and financial firms have invested 60 million Canadian dollars ($45.2 million) in identity verification startup Trulioo Information Services Inc., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-fund-identity-verification-startup-trulioos-expansion-11568712603?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports }}}\uc2 . Goldman Sachs Growth Equity led the company's Series C financing round, with participation from \uc2 Citi Ventures\uc2 , Santander InnoVentures and American Express Ventures. Banking is an ideal sector for Trulioo because of tight regulation of the industry and the sensitivity of the private information involved, according to Chief Executive Stephen Ufford.\par \par \uc2 More funding for construction software. One of a number of startups that offer software for managing construction sites, Fieldwire has raised $33.5 million in capital, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/construction-management-startup-fieldwire-raises-33-5-million-11568646000?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mr. Vartabedian reports }}}\uc2 . \uc2 Menlo Ventures\uc2  and Brick & Mortar Ventures led the deal, while construction-tools company Hilti Group and Formation 8 participated. Venture investment in construction technology has ballooned, reaching a record last year. "Construction is one of the luddites of verticals that has been late to adopt," said Tyler Sosin, a partner at \uc2 Menlo Ventures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Supply chains for electric vehicles. A supply-chain race is under way to supply Europe's burgeoning electric automobile industry. Swedish startup Northvolt AB is rushing to establish a factory to produce battery cells for vehicles, an effort that's part of a battle between Europe and China over control of the technology that powers electric cars. The WSJ's William Boston writes that Northvolt founder Peter Carlsson, a former \uc2 Tesla Inc\uc2 . supply-chain chief, aims to create a European system that links electric-car manufacturers with battery makers, all powered locally by solar and wind plants and using European workers and know-how. It's a bet on an expected demand boom as auto makers invest billions of dollars to take electric vehicles mainstream.\par \par \uc2 Newsletter Exclusive\par \par \uc2 Social media manager Sprout files for IPO. Social media management platform \uc2 Sprout Social Inc\uc2 . has filed confidentially for an IPO and plans to go public before the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . is managing the offering, the person said. Goldman was also one of its investors. Other prior investors include New Enterprise Associates and Lightbank. According to \uc2 PitchBook Data Inc\uc2 ., the company has raised over $100 million, most recently at an $800 million valuation last year.\par \par \uc2 Chicago-based Sprout had about $80 million in revenue last year with about $20 million in losses, the person said. This is up from about $45 million in revenue and about $20 million in losses the year prior.\par \par \uc2 Sprout works with businesses like \uc2 Grubhub Inc\uc2 . and Glassdoor to publish on social media platforms and analyze its effectiveness, according to the company's website.\par \par \uc2 Sprout competes with other venture-backed startups including \uc2 Sprinklr Inc\uc2 ., which has raised close to $230 million at a $1.8 billion valuation, according to PitchBook. Its backers include \uc2 Intel Capital\uc2 , ICONIQ Capital and Battery Ventures. In Vancouver, British Columbia, competitor \uc2 Hootsuite Inc\uc2 . has raised over $300 million from \uc2 Accel\uc2 , \uc2 Salesforce Ventures\uc2  and \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sprout didn't immediately respond for comment. \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  also didn't respond for comment.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Katie Roof\par \par \uc2 Women in Venture Capital Nominations\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Venture Capital is accepting nominations for our upcoming Women to Watch list.

This weekend's attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia sent shares of certain U.S. oil producers up yesterday. However, a number of U.S. producers said they don't plan to increase production to fill the production gap the attack is producing, The Wall Street Journal reports. It remains to be seen whether or not the disruption will help stave off the carnage that has been affecting private-equity backed oil-and-gas companies. This morning, Becky Yerak of WSJ Pro reports on that carnage with news that Sheridan Production Partners II has filed for bankruptcy protection.\par \par \uc2 In other news, U.K.-focused firm Pollen Street Capital is pitching its newest fund and the Journal reports that WeWork may delay its planned initial public offering.\par \par \uc2 Now on to today's news...\par \par \uc2 Today's Top Stories\par \par \uc2 Sheridan Production Fund Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\par \par \uc2 Sheridan Production Partners II LLC filed for bankruptcy with plans to hand ownership to its lenders, subject to better bids, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sheridan-production-fund-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-11568660102?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Becky Yerak writes  }}}\uc2 . The transaction is aimed at reducing the oil-and-gas company's $1.1 billion debt load by about $900 million. The Houston-based company and several affiliates filed chapter 11 petitions Sunday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. Industry challenges have squeezed liquidity, making it difficult for the business to make interest payments on its debt, the business said. The bankrupt businesses are part of a broader group established in 2006 by oil and gas executives with Warburg Pincus.\par \par \uc2 Pollen Street Capital Targets \u163\'00\'A3600 Million for Latest Fund\par \par \uc2 London's Pollen Street Capital has kicked off fundraising for its latest flagship fund, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pollen-street-capital-targets-600-million-for-latest-fund-11568652345?mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Will Louch writes for WSJ Pro  }}}\uc2 , citing a person familiar with the matter. The fund has a \u163\'00\'A3600 million ($750 million) target and, if successful, would be the largest the firm has raised since it was set up in 2013. Pollen Street was spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLCsix years ago by a group of its executives led by Lindsey McMurray as managing partner. At RBS, the team managed a $1.1 billion special opportunities fund within the bank. Pollen Street closed its most recent fund last year on \u163\'00\'A3400 million.\par \par \uc2 WeWork Parent Expected to Postpone IPO\par \par \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2 's Vision fund and \uc2 J.P. Morgan Asset Management\uc2 's PEG Digital Growth fund may have to wait a while to see the public's valuation for WeWork, after people familiar with the situation told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that \uc2 The We Co\uc2 . may put off its initial public offering until next month. The private investment arms of \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . and JP MorganChase & Co. both hold common stock in the New York company that provides locations for shared office space. Vision fund affiliates hold 113.99 million common shares and the PEG Digital funds hold 18.54 million shares, while venture funds managed by Benchmark Capital Partners own about 32.65 million shares. The delay follows questions that have been raised about the company's management and worth, the Journal said.\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 85%\par \par \uc2 The proportion of institutional investors who see \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  as an investment risk that could provoke societal backlash as well as geopolitical tensions, according to a survey from BNY Mellon Investment Management and CREATE-Research.\par \par \uc2 Deals\par \par \uc2 Silver Lake-Backed Endeavor Group Seeks $712 Million in IPO\par \par \uc2 Silver Lake Partners-backed Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. plans to raise as much as $712.3 million in its initial public offering, the entertainment company said in a regulatory filing Monday. The parent company of William Morris Endeavor, Hollywood's biggest talent agency, plans to offer 19.4 million common shares at $30 to $32 each. The company's entertainment and sports division, which negotiates media-distribution deals on behalf of more than 150 clients including the \uc2 International Olympic Committee\uc2  and National Football League, is Endeavor's biggest source of revenue, which reached $2.05 billion in the first half of this year. But Endeavor also reported a $192.6 million loss for the period. Silver Lake first invested in the company in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone Group Inc\uc2 . is taking its portfolio company Vivint Smart Home Inc. public through a blank-check company formed by \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 .'s \uc2 Fortress Investment Group\uc2  in October 2017. The deal would give Vivint an initial enterprise value of $5.6 billion. Blackstone will roll over $2.3 billion in equity in the deal and invest an additional $100 million while Fortress will add $125 million. Blackstone and affiliates will own 78% of Vivint shares after the deal closes. The company's estimated fiscal 2020 revenue is expected to reach $1.3 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are projected at $530 million, for an implied deal multiple of 10.5 times forward Ebitda. Vivint supplies cloud-enabled services and smart-home products to 1.5 million U.S. and Canadian subscribers. Blackstone acquired Vivint in November 2012 for more than $2 billion.\par \par \uc2 Advent International\uc2 's $5 billion bid to acquire U.K. aerospace supplier \uc2 Cobham PLC\uc2  won approval at a special shareholder's meeting Monday, with holders of more than 93% of the shares favoring the deal, Cobham said. Advent had to muster the support of at least three-quarters of the shares held by Cobham investors for the \u163\'00\'A34 billion cash offer, or 165 pence per share. The deal would provide investors with a 34% premium over the company's share price just prior to the disclosure of the bid. Closing the transaction remains subject to various regulatory approvals.\par \par \uc2 J.Crew Group Inc\uc2 ., the preppy clothing brand backed by TPG and Leonard Green & Partners, has filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of shares in its Madewell unit in a deal that would separate the two. J.Crew also made public a presentation on the IPO and separation that it gave to debtholders in late July. It shows the company's sponsors hold 85% of its equity and indicates that just 40% of Madewell would be sold in the IPO. Before it can pursue the offering, J.Crew has to convince a lender group that includes \uc2 Blackstone Group Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 GSO Capital Partners LP\uc2  and \uc2 Anchorage Capital Group LLC\uc2 , WSJ Pro has reported. The IPO would provide a mechanism to restructure J.Crew's debt. The company agreed one a debt extension deal with Blackstone and Anchorage in 2017 that gave the lenders a say in future restructurings.\par \par \uc2 EMEA Capital has invested in Moneybaba, a London financial technology company that specializes in emerging markets. Moneybaba is an online-only lender that distributes product through affiliations with local vendors as well, providing point-of-sale financing.

Ms. Mangos joins the firm from \uc2 Brandywine Global Investment Management\uc2 , where she served as the firm's chief information officer. She has also worked at Guardian Life Insurance and Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\par \par \uc2 H.I.G. Capital\uc2  has added two investment professionals to its European middle market buyout team in London, naming Stefano Giambelli as a principal and Tobias Borkowski as a director in the group. Mr. Giambelli is a co-founder of Amlon Capital, which invests in sectors such as consumer goods and digital media, and previously worked for \uc2 Apax Partners\uc2 . Mr. Borkowski previously co-led the private equity segment of a family office in London.

The judge's decision marks a win for Black Diamond andMJX Asset Management LLC, which hold more than 55% of Empire's $353 million in senior secured debt and had reached a deal with the Rensselaer, N.Y.-based company before it filed for chapter 11 court protection to trade those claims for ownership.\par \par \uc2 A bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of U.S. drilling-rig maker \uc2 Schramm Inc\uc2 . to private-equity firm \uc2 GenNx360 Capital Partners LP\uc2  for about $16.3 million. Judge Mary F. Walrath in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., Monday signed off on GenNx360's bid to buy the drill maker out of bankruptcy and assume its debt of $10.3 million plus $6 million in post-petition financing. The ruling came despite some creditors arguing the sale process wasn't fair because the buyer was a company insider.\par \par \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2  and \uc2 Carlyle Group LP\uc2  may lose out if \uc2 Osram Licht AG\uc2 's recommendation that shareholders accept \uc2 Ams AG\uc2  's \u8364\'20\'AC4.3 billion ($4.76 billion) takeover offer is widely accepted by shareholders. But even as it recommended the bid, Osram's leaders expressed concern about the Austrian semiconductor company's strategy and ability to manage the takeover. Osram's management and supervisory boards said Monday that their recommendation was based on Ams's offer price but they considered the entrepreneurial strategy proposed by \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2  and Carlyle as "all in all more viable" for the lighting manufacturer. Ams offered \u8364\'20\'AC38.50 per Osram share, while Bain and Carlyle offered \u8364\'20\'AC35.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20190917ef9h00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

His investment company is remaking itself in response to the impact new technologies have had on commercial real-estate cash flow\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Grant \par \uc2 833 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2019\par 17:11\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Colony Capital Inc\uc2 . is making one of the most aggressive bets yet that technology is disrupting real estate: It is selling nearly all of its traditional holdings and channeling the money into property that focuses on the tech sector.\par \par \uc2 The Los Angeles-based real-estate firm is a global investor with $55 billion in assets under management. Colony aims to sell as much as 90% of its $20 billion property portfolio of hotels, warehouses and other commercial real estate by the end of 2021, company officials said last week.\par \par \uc2 Colony said it would use the proceeds to buy data centers, mobile phone towers and fiber and grow its digital real-estate investment management business.\par \par \uc2 "We want to be mostly all things digital," said \uc2 Thomas Barrack Jr\uc2 ., a real-estate pioneer who founded Colony in the early 1990s and is the firm's chief executive and executive chairman. He is also a close friend of President Trump and headed up Mr. Trump's inaugural committee.\par \par \uc2 The remaking of the 28-year-old investment company represents an extreme response to the way new technologies have been cutting into cash flow for most every type of commercial real estate.\par \par \uc2 Hotel owners have felt pressure from short-term rental companies like \uc2 Airbnb Inc\uc2 . WeWork and other co-working firms have siphoned off corporate business from office landlords and revamped the leasing process, while e-commerce has decimated malls and their owners.\par \par \uc2 "Physical, financial and functional obsolescence [is] everywhere," Mr. Barrack said during a recent investor conference. "I'm terrified by legacy assets."\par \par \uc2 Colony's move is the latest sign that big investors are making unprecedented bets on the intersection of real estate and technology. Billions of dollars from venture-capital firms, including a record $12.9 billion raised in the first six months of 2019, are pouring into startup "prop tech" businesses that are changing workspaces, stores, distribution centers and homes.\par \par \uc2 Some in the real-estate industry view Colony's move as a risky gamble. Data centers and mobile towers face the constant danger of obsolescence from new technologies like servers with higher storage capacities, satellites and faster 5G networks being built in the telecommunications industry.\par \par \uc2 Analysts point out that Colony has a long slog ahead of it, even if its overhaul works out in the long run. For one, selling all its traditional real estate at good prices won't be easy.\par \par \uc2 "This is a longer term turnaround story," said Jade Rahmani, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "It's not as if they can snap their fingers and overnight become a digital real-estate company."\par \par \uc2 Colony executives say that their strategy reflects the higher growth potential in the digital real-estate world. They predict that giants like \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and others will continue to have demand for data centers, transmission towers and fiber-optic cable in the future from such technologies as driverless vehicles, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the Internet-of-things.\par \par \uc2 Plans for this transformation follow another overhaul of the company. In 2017, Colony combined with \uc2 NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 NorthStar Realty Finance Corp\uc2 . in a disastrous stock-for-stock merger, causing Colony's shares to plummet below $5 a share from the $14 range before the merger was announced.\par \par \uc2 Colony set the stage for its technology push in July by paying $325 million in cash and stock to acquire \uc2 Digital Bridge Holdings LLC\uc2 , which manages nearly $20 billion in digital infrastructure globally. Digital Bridge's CEO \uc2 Marc Ganzi\uc2  is slated to succeed Mr. Barrack as chief executive 18 to 24 months after the acquisition closed. Mr. Barrack will remain executive chairman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ganzi has a track record in digital infrastructure, including founding \uc2 Global Tower Partners\uc2 , a cellular tower company, which he sold in 2013 to \uc2 American Tower Corp\uc2 . in a deal valued at $4.8 billion.\par \par \uc2 The combined company currently manages 38 data centers and 350,000 tower, cellphone and other sites.\par \par \uc2 "We've had a rich history of pioneering these esoteric real-estate structures and trying to convince investors that what we're doing is more parts real estate than telecom," Mr. Ganzi told investors last week.\par \par \uc2 The data center industry also has had a history of gluts. In northern Virginia, a wave of new construction has created "headwinds" for leasing these properties, said \uc2 Paul Szurek\uc2 , chief executive of CoreSite Realty Corp., a data center owner, in a recent earnings call.\par \par \uc2 Stock investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward Colony's efforts to reinvent itself. Shares have risen from their low of $4.32 to the $5.60 range since the Digital Bridge deal closed but are still far below the adjusted high of about $18 in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Write to Peter Grant at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:peter.grant@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 peter.grant@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020190917ef9h001jm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc22}{\*\bkmkend toc22}{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw16\pich17\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal240\pichgoal255

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc23}{\*\bkmkend toc23}\b \uc2 Business News: Fire-Risk Algorithms Stir Insurance Furor --- California advocates oppose disaster- prediction models that could drive up rates\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nicole Friedman \par \uc2 854 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2019\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Finding home insurance in wildfire-prone parts of California is getting more difficult and more expensive. No one can agree on how to make it any easier.\par \par \uc2 A new flashpoint is the use of algorithmic models for predicting catastrophe losses. Insurers have long used these models to project losses from natural disasters but insurers, homeowners and regulators disagree on how they should be applied to assess California's wildfire risk.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are pushing for broader permission from the state to use catastrophe models when setting rates. But some consumers say those models are opaque and fail to adequately capture wildfire risk.\par \par \uc2 The debate over catastrophe models is part of a broader disagreement between insurers and consumer advocates over how to respond to two years of record-breaking wildfire damage in the Golden State. Many residents of fire-prone areas are either paying more for insurance or having problems securing it, and the state has warned that the situation is likely to get worse.\par \par \uc2 California wildfires cost insurers more than $24 billion in 2017 and 2018. One insurer, Merced Property & Casualty Co., was pushed to insolvency and liquidated by the state following the 2018 Camp Fire.\par \par \uc2 "Insurers are acting as you would expect where the risk is going up. They're adjusting their pricing and deciding in some cases that the risk is too high," said \uc2 Dave Jones\uc2 , senior director at \uc2 the Nature Conservancy\uc2  and a former California insurance commissioner. But without drastic steps to address climate change, he said, "we're marching steadily towards a future where the wildfire risk is uninsurable."\par \par \uc2 Catastrophe models are sold to insurers by vendors including RMS, a unit of \uc2 Daily Mail & General Trust PLC\uc2 , and AIR Worldwide, a unit of \uc2 Verisk \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 . Insurers also use products like Verisk's FireLine, which assigns properties a score of zero to 30 based on their wildfire risk.\par \par \uc2 In California, insurers can't use catastrophe models when setting statewide average rates for standard home-insurance policies, which include wildfire coverage. State regulations require insurers to rely on historical-loss data when calculating expected future losses.\par \par \uc2 California's insurance regulations are more stringent than those of most states. Insurers need to get approval before they can change the rates they charge, and rate filings are made public.\par \par \uc2 Though an insurer's average California home-insurance rate has to be based on historical data, the insurer can use catastrophe models to determine how to price policies for certain regions or segments of the market. Insurers also can use these models when deciding whether or not to insure a specific property.\par \par \uc2 But the insurance industry says its pricing would be more accurate if it could use the forward-looking models when setting overall rates. Catastrophe models run tens of thousands of simulations to project a range of possible scenarios.\par \par \uc2 Insurers say models provide a more comprehensive view of risk than historical data and are able to take climate change into account.\par \par \uc2 "We're told there's a new normal" due to climate change, which regulators and scientists have said increases wildfire risk, said Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California. But under current regulations, "we cannot use probabilistic modeling that attempts to build a rate based upon where models suggest losses will go."\par \par \uc2 Consumer advocates say the models don't give homeowners and communities enough credit for taking steps to mitigate their wildfire exposure through brush-clearing and other efforts.\par \par \uc2 "They want to have a black-box model and not let the public or advocates see what's in it," said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.\par \par \uc2 Patty Swenson of Montecito, Calif., was told earlier this year that the insurance policy for her five-bedroom home wouldn't be renewed. Her insurance agent said the insurer had cited the house's proximity to a forest as a reason, Ms. Swenson said.\par \par \uc2 But the forest near Ms. Swenson's home burned in the 2017 Thomas Fire, she said, which she thinks makes it less likely to burn again. Ms. Swenson added that her property is cleared of flammable brush and that the Montecito community has invested in safety measures to protect it from fire-related debris flow.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Swenson was able to find another insurer, but her new coverage limit is lower, leaving her underinsured, she said. "Everything we've done has further mitigated the risk of a future disaster," Ms. Swenson said. "That should count for something."\par \par \uc2 One concern for regulators is that until recently, wildfire models were less sophisticated than hurricane and earthquake models. Many insurers were shocked by the extent of the damage in 2017 and 2018 and said the previous models didn't predict those losses.\par \par \uc2 Both AIR and RMS have released new wildfire models in the past two years that they say are more predictive than past models.\par \par \uc2 But different models might still reach different conclusions about the risk facing a certain property or book of business.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20190917000013"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020190917ef9h00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that it will invest in growth deals. (Sept.16)\par \par \uc2 The founders of Aspect Ventures, a prominent female-led venture-capital firm, are parting ways to launch separate firms.\par \par \uc2 Jennifer Fonstad, who focused on digital health and enterprise software, is creating \uc2 Owl Capital\uc2  to invest in early-stage deals, and \uc2 Theresia Gouw\uc2 , named by Forbes last year as the wealthiest female venture investor, is setting up her own early-stage firm called Acrew.\par \par \uc2 "We saw very much eye to eye in terms of our investments and strategy. But we had very different leadership styles and different ways of operating at the portfolio level," Ms. Fonstad said of the moves, adding that she wanted to run a small, boutique firm.\par \par \uc2 The two teams continue to work out of Aspect's offices, Ms. Fonstad said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gouw declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Some other well-known venture partnerships have disbanded in recent years because the partners wanted more control. \uc2 Mary Meeker{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-firm-kleiner-perkins-plans-to-split-1536933600"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recently left Kleiner Perkins }}}\uc2  to set up her own growth fund.

Other Aspect team members joining Ms. Fonstad will be Chad Herrin and Rebecca Hu, she said.\par \par \uc2 Several Aspect team members are expected to join Ms. Gouw at her new firm, including Lauren Kolodny, who led the firm's Series A investment in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chime-raises-9m-to-bring-banking-to-millennials-1463657408"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mobile bank Chime }}}\uc2 , among other deals, and Vishal Lugani, who co-led or worked with PredictHQ Ltd., Pie Insurance Holdings Inc. and others, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Acrew aims to raise about $175 million, a person familiar with the situation said. \uc2 Owl Capital\uc2  hopes to raise around $125 million.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Fonstad and Ms. Gouw {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020140205ea25g34e3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 formed Palo Alto, Calif.-based Aspect }}}\uc2  in 2014 after serving as managing director at \uc2 Draper Fisher Jurvetson\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14now called Threshold Ventures\u8212\'20\'14and managing general partner at \uc2 Accel\uc2 , respectively.\par \par \uc2 "It was very hard for two women to individually raise funds," Ms. Fonstad said. "It was not an era when that could be done, so we combined forces. But the entrepreneurial itch continued to be there for both of us."\par \par \uc2 Aspect raised two funds, a $150 million debut vehicle in 2015 and a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aspect-ventures-closes-second-fund-at-181-million-1516710617"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  $181 million pool }}}\uc2  in January 2018. Melinda Gates and \uc2 Cisco Systems Inc\uc2 . were among the limited partners in the second fund.\par \par \uc2 Aspect's team will continue to manage the firm's existing portfolio but will make any new investments out of their new funds, Ms. Fonstad said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gouw is a longtime investor in consumer internet, enterprise software and cybersecurity startups. At Aspect she led investments in networking company Cato Networks Ltd., security startup \uc2 Exabeam Inc\uc2 . and cybersecurity company \uc2 Forescout Technologies Inc\uc2 ., which went public in 2017, among others. At \uc2 Accel\uc2 , she invested in companies including cybersecurity company \uc2 Imperva Inc\uc2 ., digital real-estate company \uc2 Trulia Inc\uc2 . and financial planning company LearnVest Inc.

SoftBank had a tough week, with Uber being threatened by California's new law on gig workers and WeWork's IPO plagued by weak interest. SoftBank is doubling down on WeWork, at least: It plans to buy at least $750 million in shares of WeWork's IPO, the Journal reports.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, subprime credit-card startup Mission Lane LLC has secured $500 million, faring better than it did when it was part of financial-technology company LendUp.\par \par \uc2 In IPO news, \uc2 Cloudflare\uc2 's shares rose 20% in their first day of trading Friday.

The Japanese technology conglomerate, already the biggest investor in WeWork's parent, would end up with 25% or more of the shares sold in an offering that is expected to raise at least $3 billion and value the startup at between $15 billion and $20 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mission Lane raises $500 million. Subprime credit-card startup Mission Lane LLC has secured $500 million in financing, emerging from a difficult period of fundraising when it was part of financial-technology company LendUp. The company raised $200 million in equity from Invus Opportunities, LL Funds LLC, QED Investors and funds managed by \uc2 Oaktree Capital Management LP\uc2 , while \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . provided $300 million of debt, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/subprime-credit-card-startup-mission-lane-raises-500-million-after-separating-from-lendup-11568635673?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Katie Roof and Peter Rudegeair write for WSJ Pro }}}\uc2 . Mission Lane split from LendUp, formally Flurish Inc., last December, after the combined company struggled to raise capital at its desired valuation.\par \par \uc2 Fixing hearing loss. Scientists are pursuing the first medicines to treat hearing loss, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Today's principal treatments\u8212\'20\'14hearing aids and electronic devices called cochlear implants\u8212\'20\'14help many people who have suffered damage to their ears caused by aging, noise, genetics or drugs. But neither of those treatments cures or counters the biological causes of hearing loss. By contrast, several experimental new drugs aim to do just that. Many of these efforts are still in the early stages. But a few drugs and treatments with potential are now in clinical trials, and investigators say that growing understanding of both the genetics of hearing loss and how the ear works have them hopeful of success.\par \par \uc2 The gig is up. A decade after companies like Uber rocketed to popularity by offering low-cost, on-demand services, governments are pushing back, demanding many of the same labor protections and other regulatory requirements that the companies avoided in devising their business models, the Journal's Eliot Brown reports. Regulatory moves threaten to add significant costs for the gig economy, which extends beyond Uber and Lyft to a host of delivery companies like \uc2 DoorDash\uc2  and \uc2 Instacart\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Today's IPO: \uc2 Cloudflare Inc\uc2 . shares rose 20% in their trading debut Friday after the company's initial public offering of 35 million shares was priced at $15 each, above the expected range of $12 to $14 apiece, the Journal reported. The San Francisco provider of cloud-based networking and cybersecurity services said it would have about 293.3 million shares outstanding after the IPO, giving it a valuation of about $4.4 billion before the start of trading. Major shareholders before the IPO included \uc2 New Enterprise Associates\uc2 .

Investors will be confronted with difficult asset allocation choices and changes in business models.\par \par \uc2 "Today's asset management industry may well be unrecognisable by the end of the next decade in the face of these two global mega trends. A profound transformation is now in the pipeline," said Amin Rajan, chief executive of Cre-ate-Research, the consultancy. Create-Research interviewed 45 CIOs, portfolio managers and strategists across 16 countries about their assessment of the risks presented by AI and climate change.\par \par \uc2 Two-thirds of the participants said AI would "definitely" rewrite asset management and a fifth rated this as a probability.\par \par \uc2 Tools such as cognitive computing, \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and social media are used by portfolio managers and quantitative specialists to look for informational advantages over rival players.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Israel is becoming a testing ground for the power of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to improve health care.\par \par \uc2 Digital medical records for the vast majority of Israelis are currently stored in databases maintained by the handful of semipublic HMOs that provide most health care in Israel. While the biggest health-maintenance organizations already leverage their records in partnerships with private companies to develop technology for more advanced health care, Israel's government wants to take such efforts to a new level.\par \par \uc2 The government last year announced a $264 million initiative to begin to combine those millions of records into a giant unified system, one that takes decades of individual patients' information and puts it all in the same format so medical data looks the same across all health-care institutions. Corralling the records and organizing them in ways that maximize their usefulness to AI programs and data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the government hopes, will make the data of even greater value to researchers and health-care companies. And the greater goals, officials say, based largely on the promise of AI technology, are to make health care less expensive, more effective and better tailored to individuals everywhere.\par \par \uc2 AI-assisted machines and programs, with their ability to learn and draw conclusions from the millions of detailed histories, medical tests and diagnostic results stored in these records, have the potential to help doctors give more preventive care by spotting diseases in earlier stages; tailor more medicine to the needs of specific patients; read diagnostic imagery and lab tests faster and more accurately; and make health-care less expensive.\par \par \uc2 Israel's plans rely on patients giving their consent for their clinical data to be transferred from the HMOs to the government system. Patients who agree will be asked to supply genetic information and other additional data as well.\par \par \uc2 Medical experts and government officials in Israel are still grappling with the ethical and privacy implications of the initiative. But a number of international health officials say the potential benefits outweigh the pitfalls. Israel's health-care system already is globally recognized as a leader in using digitally stored data for public health-care delivery. This includes HMO programs and activities such as constantly running algorithms on their patients' data to detect signs of kidney disease or colon cancer.\par \par \uc2 "I have seen a tremendous amount of output from AI digital startups coming out of Israel," says \uc2 Eric Topol\uc2 , director of the La Jolla, Calif.-based Scripps Research Translational Institute, which specializes in tech-powered personalized medicine.\par \par \uc2 Officials say it could take a decade before the unified system equals the size of databases the HMOs already have. While the effort may at first seem duplicative, the officials emphasize that the point is to make the data more accessible to a broader group of researchers and businesses. The HMOs themselves currently maintain the health records of all Israeli citizens, and their sharing of their own databases with Israeli companies and multinationals working with Israeli partners has led to an explosion of AI-based digital health-care technologies in the country. The Israeli government has helped encourage partnerships and cooperation agreements with foreign businesses and research institutes as well. The technology produced from such partnerships has the potential to be adopted by the national health-care system.\par \par \uc2 Creating a similar system in the U.S. could be difficult, since most U.S. medical providers aren't digitally connected, or compatible, and must adhere to strict national privacy laws. In Israel, the four government-run HMOs have kept digital records in compatible formats for all patients since the early 1990s. The U.S. and several other countries are working to create similar national databases as Israel, but the data isn't likely to be of the same quality.\par \par \uc2 Under the rules of the Israeli initiative, parties accessing the data are barred from identifying patients or otherwise causing them harm, government officials say. But some ethicists warn of the dangers of unintended consequences.\par \par \uc2 Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a technology-policy specialist at the Israel Democracy Institute think tank in Jerusalem, says Israel needs legislation that will clearly regulate when patient data can and cannot be used. Health data should be used only to create technology that would clearly benefit the health of Israeli citizens, Dr. Altshuler says, and should not be sold simply for profit. Moreover, people should be informed every time their data may be used on a given project to allow them to opt in or out, she says.\par \par \uc2 The HMOs and Israel's government say the data is anonymized, meaning it removes any features that could identify any patient. But that might not be enough to satisfy some critics of the project. Dr. Altshuler points to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a study}}}\uc2  published in Nature Communications in July that showed that 99.98% of Americans could be re-identified from any anonymized data set using 15 demographic characteristics, such as age, marital status and gender.\par \par \uc2 Health officials are working on legislation that would regulate access to the government and HMO databases, says Itai Kela, head of health tech at the Israel Innovation Authority, a business-focused government agency that is working on the database initiative with the prime minister's office and the Health Ministry.\par \par \uc2 "The world is global: On one hand you don't want to sell the data outside; it's private data for Israeli citizens," Dr. Kela says. "But on the other hand, you want to collaborate."\par \par \uc2 Yael Villa, who is heading the work on the national database, known as the Mosaic Initiative, says she wants to create not just a database with clean, easy-to-use data, but a virtual platform that will also give researchers the analytical tools needed to run experiments quickly.\par \par \uc2 "The idea is to do the dirty work for them and have them invest their time in what they really need to do," she says.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Villa says that while it could take a few years to reach even 100,000 volunteers, what will differentiate the Israeli national database from other such initiatives will be the combination of the rare 20-year-deep clinical records combined with genomic data.\par \par \uc2 The work so far is moving slowly. Important issues that still need to be resolved include figuring out how the HMOs will transfer their data to the government system, and exactly who will have access.\par \par \uc2 The breadth and quality of Israel's trove of medical information are nearly unrivaled, experts say. The HMOs have kept digital patient records from cradle to grave\u8212\'20\'14primary and specialty care, lab work, pharmaceutical prescriptions, hospital care and geographic data. The data is well organized, too. Doctors across individual HMO systems use the same methods and formats for note taking, experts say, which will make it easier to design software for working with the new databases\u8212\'20\'14and, more important, make it easier for AI systems to analyze the data and learn from it.\par \par \uc2 Lack of good data in compatible formats has been a major problem for companies trying to leverage technological progress and increased computing power to achieve new breakthroughs in medical science and health care.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Topol, of Scripps Research Translational Institute, says Israel's data sets help it bypass "a bottleneck for moving the field forward."\par \par \uc2 Mining the Israeli data for new insights could provide a windfall for the country's already-booming health-care-tech industry. More than 500 Israeli-based startups work in digital health in Israel and together have raised capital in excess of $500 million in 2018, according to Start-Up Nation Central, a Tel Aviv nonprofit that connects businesses to Israel's tech companies.\par \par \uc2 "As the world moves more and more in the direction [of \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  health care], Israel will be more and more central," says Scott Duke Kominers, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and co-author of a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://hbr.org/product/maccabitech-the-promise-of-israel-s-healthcare-data/819032-EPB-ENG"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 study}}}\uc2  that examined the research arm of Israel's second-largest HMO, Maccabi, and its work with private companies to create technology using its database.\par \par \uc2 Israel has "an unusually strong competitive advantage because of the way the Israeli health-care system works: It's the combination of the data and the computer-science talent," Mr. Kominers says.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, while the government databases are still years away from completion, Israeli companies already have used the HMO databases to great effect.\par \par \uc2 One example is K Health, a mobile app launched in 2018 that helps users understand their ailments by mimicking a conversation with a live doctor. The app, through a partnership with Maccabitech, \u8203\'20\'0Bhas access to millions of Israeli medical records, analyzing them in seconds. Users tell the app their age, gender and what's wrong. The app then takes less than a minute to compare the user with thousands of similar cases.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S., users can pay to speak with doctors who work with K Health about the results. In Israel, users will soon be able to order simple lab tests after consulting the app, bypassing the need to see a family doctor first.\par \par \uc2 Allon Bloch, a K Health founder, says Maccabitech has access to more than 400 million doctors notes, more than a billion lab exams and hundreds of millions of prescriptions, among other data. Mr. Bloch says his company will continue to add data to the app from countries it operates in.\par \par \uc2 Anthem Inc\uc2 ., the U.S.-based insurance giant, announced a partnership in July with K Health to eventually bring the app's services to its 40 million clients. The app will let consumers, including those who don't have Anthem insurance, schedule and pay for medical visits through their smartphones, as well as learn potential diagnoses and text with doctors.\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0BIn May, Israel's Innovation Authority signed a memorandum with the Mayo Clinic for Israeli health startups to team up with the U.S. institution's researchers and equipment. There are currently five Israeli companies working with the Mayo Clinic, and dozens more have applied for future work.\par \par \uc2 "We have been impressed by the level of expertise and how Israeli companies have been able to leverage \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  approaches developed in other areas and apply them to solve problems in health care," says Kelly Krajnik, director of strategic opportunities at the Mayo Clinic.\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0BFor example, researchers at the Mayo Clinic worked with the Israeli-based Beyond Verbal, a voice-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company that uses Israeli health data, in a 2016 a study that found a correlation between certain voice characteristics and heart disease. The study shows doctors can use a noninvasive method of checking for heart disease just by analyzing a voice.\par \par \uc2 Another example is Zebra Medical Vision, an Israeli company that uses AI to search for and recognize ailments in CT scans, X-rays and mammograms. The company received grants from Israel's government to deploy its technology throughout Israel's hospitals and health clinics. It charges customers roughly the equivalent of $1 a scan.\par \par \uc2 While health-care officials are pleased with the results they have seen so far in terms of delivering new technologies, Israeli privacy advocates remain concerned about what they see as a national experiment with sensitive information in medical records.\par \par \uc2 "This is one of the biggest hacks of privacy in Israel," says Dr. Altshuler, the technology-policy specialist. "We are going to be very sorry for this process in the near future."\par \par \uc2 Varda Shalev\uc2 , head of Maccabitech, says her HMO uses the highest standards of security. She says the small risks to privacy are worth the benefit.\par \par \uc2 "Putting it in balance," Dr. Shalev says, "I think we are doing the right thing."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lieber is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in Israel.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Otis Elevator Co\uc2 . hired a new finance chief as it gets ready to separate from industrial conglomerate \uc2 United Technologies Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Farmington, Conn.-based maker of elevators and escalators said Monday that \uc2 Rahul Ghai\uc2  is its new chief financial officer. Mr. Ghai joins from defense company \uc2 Harris Corp\uc2 ., which this year completed a combination with \uc2 L3 Technologies\uc2 . Mr. Ghai had been Harris's CFO since February 2016. Prior to Harris, he worked in financial roles at health insurer Aetna Inc. and Otis's parent company, \uc2 United Technologies\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 United Technologies\uc2  is in the process of breaking itself {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-technologies-to-separate-into-three-independent-companies-1543272920"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 into three entities}}}\uc2 , even as competitor \uc2 Thyssenkrupp AG\uc2  prepares to sell its elevator unit.\par \par \uc2 United Technologies\uc2 's Carrier Global Corp., the heating-and-cooling business, and Otis are expected to become separate companies in 2020, leaving \uc2 United Technologies\uc2  to focus on aerospace. Carrier Global on Friday{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/carriers-new-cfo-to-guide-spinoff-from-united-technologies-11568409546"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 appointed a new CFO}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Otis is seeking approval from regulators on its future capital and tax structure and is setting up its own management and finance systems, United Technologies Chief Executive \uc2 Gregory Hayes\uc2  said at an investor conference Thursday.\par \par \uc2 That will entail additional costs because Otis will no longer benefits from centralized functions. Mr. Ghai is expected to focus on reducing costs across departments and on pruning the independent entity's portfolio, said Joshua Aguilar, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.\par \par \uc2 Otis in its latest quarter reported a 6% drop in new equipment orders compared to the same prior-year period. Some of that decline is down to slowing economic growth in China, an important market for Otis, resulting in pricing pressure for the manufacturer.\par \par \uc2 "Pricing has been a big detriment for Otis," said Sheila Kahyaoglu, an equity analyst at investment bank \uc2 Jefferies LLC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Otis generates about 45% of its revenue from sales of new elevators, while maintenance services account for 55% of its turnover. The company recorded net sales of $3.3 billion in the quarter ended June 30.\par \par \uc2 Competitor Thyssenkrupp is also working to separate its elevator division in response to criticism from activist investors over its structure. The company initially planned to break itself up, but shelved those plans in May as it seeks to sell part of the elevator business {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thyssenkrupp-abandons-planned-split-pursues-ipo-11557486499"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in an initial public offering}}}\uc2  during the 2019-20 fiscal year. Management is also listening to potential buyers, Chief Executive \uc2 Guido Kerkhoff\uc2  has said.\par \par \uc2 A potential sale or IPO at Thyssenkrupp could highlight the state of the unit's maintenance services compared to Otis, said Josh Sullivan, an analyst at Seaport Global Securities LLC. "The growth in this industry is on the service side," Mr. Sullivan said.

A profound transformation is now in the pipeline,\u8221\'20\'1D said Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create-Research, the consultancy.\par \par \uc2 Create-Research interviewed 45 chief investment officers, portfolio managers and strategists across 16 countries about their assessment of the risks and challenges presented by AI\u160\'00\'A0and climate change. The consultancy also canvassed views on how these two trends will influence asset allocation decisions and ultimately reshape the investment industry.\par \par \uc2 Two-thirds of the survey participants said developments in AI would \u8220\'20\'1Cdefinitely\u8221\'20\'1D rewrite the future of asset management globally and a further fifth rated this as a probability.\par \par \uc2 Tools such as cognitive computing, \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and social media are increasingly used by portfolio managers and quantitative specialists to look for informational advantages over rival players. Blockchain and robotic process automation are being applied to back-office functions such as fund accounting and settlements.\par \par \uc2 Mr Rajan said developments in AI could help asset managers save costs, increase returns and improve the quality of services provided to clients.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CAI can do things previously unimaginable with the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It can deliver an edge given the information intensity of all of the processes in asset management,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 More than half (57 per cent) of survey participants said they viewed climate change as both a risk and opportunity, reflecting widespread uncertainty about how global warming might affect investment portfolios.\par \par \uc2 Mr Rajan said investors were faced with \u8220\'20\'1Chuge judgment calls\u8221\'20\'1D on the potential loss of value in stranded assets such as coal and oil reserves at a time when renewable energy technology had not progressed enough to make a big dent in fossil fuel dependency.\par \par \uc2 In addition, few countries have priced carbon pollution high enough to meet globally agreed temperature targets, leaving investors to guess when more draconian measures might become inevitable.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Matt Oomen, global head of distribution at BNY Mellon Investment Management which commissioned the research, said\u160\'00\'A0 \u8220\'20\'1Csupertanker trends\u8221\'20\'1D, such as AI and climate change, posed big challenges for the investment community.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are already witnessing changes in the way markets operate in response to these\u160\'00\'A0 trends.

While uncomfortable for businesses at the receiving end, those challenges have spelt new opportunities for law firms that are helping their clients navigate them. "The world in Europe changed last year and it was all to do with GDPR," says Patrick Van Eecke, partner and global co-chair of data protection, privacy and security at law firm \uc2 DLA Piper\uc2 . To some, the letters GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) might conjure up needy emails from retailers and news websites beseeching customers "not to leave". But for companies operating across the EU, the new data protection rules, designed to prevent the abuse of personal data, have resulted in big new obligations and potentially devastating fines for breaches.\par \par \uc2 "Before that, companies could shuffle breaches into the background and hope no one would find out about them," says Mr Van Eecke. Today companies have just 72 hours to notify their relevant data regulator in the UK, the Information Commissioner and risk punitive fines of up to 4 per cent of their annual revenues or \u8364\'20\'AC20m, whichever is the higher, for infringing certain rules. In the UK, for example, \uc2 DLA Piper\uc2  lawyers across Europe, the firm launched its Notify software, which uses an algorithm based on the requirements, definitions and exemptions surrounding data breaches and the necessary response. It replaces a process of human interpretation with a streamlined questionnaire that spits out a reporting template too. Last year \uc2 British Airways\uc2  was the first company to be fined under GDPR by the UK regulator, after cyber hackers stole personal data of half a million of the airline's customers, resulting in a \u163\'00\'A3183m fine. Lawyers have legal privilege, giving them an advantage over the Big Four accountancy the previous maximum fine was \u163\'00\'A3500,000, as levied on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  in 2018 for failing to protect users' personal information in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Yet, despite the possibility of fines, there are no clear guidelines on how to define the severity of a breach, and it is not straightforward to work out whether customers should be informed. "Companies are struggling with the definitions of 'high impact' and 'high risk' in the context of a data breach because it has not been defined by legislation," says Mr Van Eecke. Some law firms have devised systems to help companies understand their responsibilities. After work by and consultancy firms, which have been encroaching on law firms' turf, particularly in areas of employment law and intellectual property. "Law is the only profession to offer privilege on all information shared in a cyber incident," says Mr Van Eecke. "When the situation can change on an hour-by-hour basis you don't want to have any documents created by consultants which do not fall under privilege, as the company could be in extreme danger," he argues. Another seismic regulatory shift has hit companies in Europe over the past year. In January 2018, European market rules were overhauled in ambitious reforms known as Mifid II. The aim was to afford greater protection to investors and improve transparency of trading and investing across asset classes, from derivatives to bonds and fixed income. But the legislation seven years in the making and running to some 1.5m paragraphs of text had a big impact on companies operating in financial markets, which sought stringent advice from lawyers and consultancies. One change affected financial companies relying on trading venues, which have mushroomed across Europe. After Mifid II came in, the venues amended their rules. "The rule books can range from 50 pages to over 200," says April Brousseau, head of innovation and new business The devil is in the data Seismic regulatory shifts for companies in Europe spell new opportunities for law firms. By Kate Beioley Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testifies to a \uc2 US Senate\uc2  committee last year PHOTO: GETTY 30 at law firm \uc2 Simmons & Simmons\uc2 . The firm has devised Trading Venue Reviewer, a tool that allows clients to compare and contrast the rules on each venue on a single platform. Regulatory changes such as Mifid II, GDPR and uncertainty thrown up by Brexit have led to new mandates for the Big Four accounting and consultancy firms. The Big Four, it was predicted in 2017, could earn as much as $30bn a year from consulting business, A&O Consulting, and says it is filling a gap highlighted by clients, including big banks. "Law firms have tended to give structural advice and consultancy firms have come in to do the implementation. But as a bank you have to deal with two different parties and there's a risk of a lack of co-ordination or the ball getting dropped between the two," says Tom Lodder, legal services, according to ALM Intelligence, a consulting and legal analyst. In July, one of the Big Four, Deloitte, hired Andrew Lilley, former managing partner at law firm Travers Smith, to lead its employment practice, having secured an alternative business licence in June 2018. The move intensified an increasingly fierce turf war. Magic circle law firm \uc2 Allen & Overy\uc2  has set up its own managing director of A&O Consulting. "The incumbents probably aren't happy with the increased competition. We have interaction with the Big Four and we are learning from them and, in some cases, stealing talent too." New Products and Services Rank Law firm Originality Leadership Impact Total Standout Kennedys Developed a suite of products for claims management, helping clients to save time, money and use lawyers less. PuniWraps, an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  tool for Bermuda-based clients to manage high-volume, low-level punitive damage claims, reduces processing time by 40 per cent and saves an average $500 per claim. The Subro tool takes out the complexity for clients to recover damages owed by third parties, removing the need for external lawyers. A third tool, Riverstone, enables clients to manage high-volume construction claims at speed and scale. 9 8 8 25 \uc2 Simmons & Simmons\uc2  Developed the Trading Venue Reviewer to provide clients with summaries of the rule books and associated risks of more than 140 trading venues in Europe. The tool is subscription based and customisable, helping clients ensure compliance and operational efficiency to avoid fines and sanctions. The firm estimates it would take four times longer to manage risks and requirements for the venues without TVR. 8 8 8 24 Highly commended Dentons Established a new service for central European clients that advises on opportunities for EU funding, grants and tax incentives to further company research and development of new technology. The offering combines legal, tax, consulting, financial, scientific and technological expertise. The group is advising 15 clients on \u8364\'20\'AC250m worth of grants and funded projects to develop new intellectual property and process improvements. 7 8 8 23 \uc2 DLA Piper\uc2  Developed Notify, an algorithmic tool to help clients assess both the severity of a data breach and whether they are required to report it to authorities within the set 72-hour window. Lawyers and technologists across the firm's European offices collaborated with the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, using official reporting standards to develop the algorithm, removing personal bias in decision making. 8 8 7 23 Ecija Partnering with Prodigioso Volc\u225\'00\'E1n, a Spanish public relations agency, the firm produces plain-language contracts for financial sector clients, combining clear language with visual communication. Financial institutions in Spain had been under scrutiny for using unclear and potentially misleading language in customer contracts, requiring a reworking of much of their documentation. Clients include local council projects such as the redesign of traffic fines. \uc2 Mishcon de Reya\uc2  Two new services, MDR Brand and MDR Cyber have expanded the firm's offering into consulting and other professional services. MDR Brand packages services such as brand licensing, commercial partnerships, intellectual property and legal advisory for clients. MDR Cyber combines legal advice with reputational management, cyber security and digital investigations. Software developed in-house supports the offering, helping the team to capture data faster and with less risk for clients. 8 8 7 23 \uc2 Norton Rose Fulbright\uc2  Developed N-Accelerate, a process for the automation of complex transaction documents, making production 10 times faster than traditional document automation tools, with an error rate of zero. The process has enabled lawyers without coding experience to automate Loan Market Association documents and templates for other transactions. The time taken to draft LMAs has shrunk from 10 hours to 20 minutes. 7 8 8 23 8 8 7 23 Commended \uc2 Allen & Overy\uc2  Launched A&O Consulting to provide strategic advice and operational support to clients on complex regulatory matters. Consultants combine traditional legal services with advisory on governance, corporate purpose and culture, operational risk and regulatory policy. Deloitte Legal (Spain) Following the introduction of tax obligations in Spain requiring companies to provide real-time invoice data to tax authorities, the firm developed My Tax \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to automate the process and leverage the potential of the new datasets. The system can detect invoicing discrepancies, automatically populate tax forms and improve budgeting and resource planning. 7 22 Mills & Reeve According to the \uc2 UK's Solicitors Regulation Authority\uc2 , 75 per cent of all reported cyber crimes in 2016 were "Friday afternoon frauds", when large sums are handled at the completion of property conveyancing transactions, worth a total of \u163\'00\'A385m. The firm has set up a service with insurance client Pen Underwriting to streamline responses to notification of a fraud, reducing reaction time and recouping more 50 per cent of its 2018 losses, amounting to \u163\'00\'A32.5m. Shoosmiths Development Constraints is a new service for property developers to reduce the burden of costly and unnecessary insurance premiums on greenfield projects. A team of lawyers analysed surveyor reports to assess whether the legal risks associated with high-rise construction, such as the impact on a neighbour's right to natural light, were properly appraised. The firm found that reports frequently assessed this risk to be too high, which led to unnecessarily expensive insurance cover. Commended: Wayne Nash. CMS Expanded the equIP programme to international markets. Now 73 start-ups from more than 20 countries are involved in the incubation programme. CMS lawyers who worked for the start-ups at a discounted rate do not suffer remuneratively. Lawyers have worked on four exits and 60 fundraisings since the programme's inception in 2015.

The tool was built on Neota Logic's automation software, using decisiontree logic, cutting time and costs associated with complying with the new initial margin rules. \uc2 Herbert Smith Freehills\uc2  Developed software to determine automatically what personal information data breaches contain, and whether there are notification requirements. Documents with the most sensitive data are prioritised and the software works with the ediscovery software Relativity to enhance efficiencies. Estimated cost savings on medium-sized breaches are $200,000. Commended: Andrew Moir. Selepey, Volkovetsky & Partners Specialising in the distressed assets market in Ukraine, the firm combines legal and broader business advice to improve compliance with consulting services to assist business development for clients. The firm takes options in revitalised assets rather than a fee based on hourly billing, and has revitalised several large supermarket chains. Toffoletto De Luca Tamajo e Soci Implemented a structured process to commoditise legal services, developing several products that lawyers can pitch as part of their service to clients. Teams of lawyers and trainees worked together to develop and market the new tools, which cover long-distance employee monitoring, flexible working policies, data privacy, employee benefit plans and whistleblowing. 7 8 7 22 7 8 7 7 8 22 8 8 6 22 6 8 7 21 7 7 7 21 6 7 7 20 7 7 6 20 6 7 7 20 6 7 7 20 New Products RESEARCH AND AWARD SUPPORTED BY 32 ING has set up an 'Obeya' war room to discuss topics Strategy and Changing Behaviours Rank Law firm Originality Leadership Impact Total Standout \uc2 Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer\uc2  The firm is one year into a threeyear digital transformation strategy to change the way it approaches client matters, technology and the lawyer/business professional divide.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LONDON\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 London Stock Exchange Group PLC\uc2  took a swipe at \uc2 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd\uc2 . Friday, rejecting its $36.6 billion bid and questioning Hong Kong's future as a financial gateway to China.\par \par \uc2 Undeterred, the HKEX said it was disappointed the \uc2 LSE\uc2  had failed to properly engage in talks and said it would continue to talk to \uc2 LSE\uc2  shareholders about its unsolicited offer.\par \par \uc2 The U.K. operator said it remains committed to buying financial-information and terminal company Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/london-stock-exchange-eyes-27-billion-bet-for-blackstones-refinitiv-11564222109"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a $14.5 billion deal it struck in July}}}\uc2  that would have been scrapped if the Hong Kong exchange succeeded in its bid.\par \par \uc2 Shares in \uc2 LSE\uc2  were 2% higher after the rejection, having already risen almost 6% on Wednesday after HKEX announced its unsolicited offer, surprising investors. Analysts say HKEX could improve its offer with a larger cash component, or that other exchanges may want to bid for the London exchange.\par \par \uc2 HKEX's bid has led some investors and analysts to question whether a new round of global exchange consolidation is coming, potentially involving the U.S. exchange giants: NYSE parent \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange Inc\uc2 ., known as \uc2 ICE\uc2 , or futures-exchange behemoth \uc2 CME Group Inc\uc2 ., the world's biggest exchange operator by market cap.\par \par \uc2 "We'd expect the U.S. exchanges might be viewed as logical additions to fill the North American presence of a truly global exchange model," \uc2 Sandler O'Neill + Partners\uc2  wrote in a research note Thursday. \uc2 ICE\uc2  explored a possible bid for the \uc2 LSE\uc2  in 2016 but ultimately backed away.\par \par \uc2 Representatives of \uc2 CME\uc2  and \uc2 ICE\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to the Hong Kong exchange issued publicly, LSE Chairman \uc2 Don Robert\uc2  said \uc2 LSE\uc2 's board doesn't believe HKEX is the best partner for its long-term positioning in Asia, and that the company's cash-and-shares offer is unattractive because of "inherent uncertainty" around the value of HKEX shares.\par \par \uc2 "We question the sustainability of HKEX's position as a strategic gateway in the longer term," Mr. Robert said. He added that the \uc2 Shanghai Stock Exchange\uc2  is its preferred and direct channel to access opportunities in China.\par \par \uc2 A successful tie-up between \uc2 LSE\uc2  and HKEX looked like a long shot to many analysts because of regulatory and political hoops. Hong Kong is reeling from a summer of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-protesters-call-for-u-s-support-11567931423"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 antigovernment protests}}}\uc2  that have raised concerns about China's tightening grip on the financial center. London is grappling with its own political upheaval in the form of Brexit.\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-li-hong-kong-exchanges-salesman-in-chief-confronts-china-challenge-11568294952"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Charles Li Linked Hong Kong and China but LSE Deal Could Be a Bridge Too Far}}}\uc2  (Sept. 12)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-stock-exchange-makes-36-56-billion-bid-for-london-stock-exchange-11568193034"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Hong Kong Stock Exchange Bids Nearly $37 Billion for London Rival}}}\uc2 (Sept. 11)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/london-stock-exchanges-big-bet-is-profitable-but-risky-11564415872"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heard on the Street: London Stock Exchange's Big Bet Is Profitable but Risky}}}\uc2  (July 29)\par \par \uc2 The history of the exchange business over the past decade is riddled with failed cross-border deals. Many of these were blocked by regulators out of concerns that a prized national asset would be taken over by foreigners, or that the takeover would give the combined company monopolistic pricing power in crucial financial markets. Exchanges themselves have often failed to agree on deal terms and how to structure a combined entity.\par \par \uc2 The bid from Hong Kong was the latest for \uc2 LSE\uc2 , which has become a highly sought-after target for a range of suitors over several years, attracting multiple bids and making multiple acquisitions of its own. The group, which has been offering stock trading for more than 200 years, now derives much of its value from data services and the popularity of passive investing.\par \par \uc2 Revenue from \uc2 LSE\uc2 's clearing house and financial indexing business far outstrips a 20% contribution from its more traditional exchange businesses of floating companies and securities trading. That was the big lure for the Hong Kong exchange group.\par \par \uc2 LSE\uc2 's stock has soared ninefold in the past 10 years, compared with a 47% rise in the FTSE 100 index of the U.K.'s largest companies. It had risen 80% this year even before the HKEX offer.\par \par \uc2 That performance sets it apart from other U.K. financial companies such as banks whose stocks have been dragged down by low interest rates and stricter regulation since the financial crisis. In contrast, \uc2 LSE\uc2  has benefited from postcrisis rules pushing more derivatives through its LCH clearing house and a boom in indexed funds.\par \par \uc2 Tracing its roots to City of London coffee houses where stockbrokers set up shop, \uc2 LSE\uc2  thrived as London established itself as a global hub for company fundraising and trading. It floated its own shares in 2000, and spent much of the next decade fending off takeover attempts by rivals including \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  and \uc2 Deutsche Boerse AG\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It has averaged a bid approach every 2\u189\'00\'BD years since its initial public offering, according to analysts at \uc2 Berenberg Bank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But while British banks during the 2000s were multiplying in value from global expansion and increased risk taking, the London exchange was at threat of becoming obsolete. Its monopoly on domestic stock trading was ended by a 2007 \uc2 European Union\uc2  directive that paved the way for alternative trading platforms. It suffered more and its shares slumped as company listings and trading volumes collapsed after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Xavier Rolet\uc2 , who was LSE's chief executive between 2009 and 2017, is credited with reversing the decline and transforming the company into a global force. He led the acquisition of around 25 companies, including LCH and the FTSE Russell financial indexing business.\par \par \uc2 As of June 30, \uc2 LSE\uc2 's post-trade services made up 38% of its \u163\'00\'A31.14 billion ($1.41 billion) in revenue, and information services made up 39%.\par \par \uc2 In an interview Thursday, Mr. Rolet said his vision for \uc2 LSE\uc2  was to deepen its role connecting companies, banks and investors globally, and to let users pay for the products and pieces of financial plumbing they needed access to, rather than making them pay for bundled services at a single price.\par \par \uc2 "We wanted to be one of the two or three financial infrastructure companies with the full set of products," Mr. Rolet said. He predicted \uc2 LSE\uc2  will eventually have an American or Chinese owner as the industry continues to consolidate.\par \par \uc2 His successor, \uc2 David Schwimmer\uc2 , set three goals for the group: to expand globally, become more diversified by asset class and bolster its data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business. In August, Mr. Schwimmer said the plan to buy Refinitiv, which supplies market information and operates foreign-exchange and bond trading platforms, addresses all of those ambitions.\par \par \uc2 LSE\uc2 's earlier smart bets made the Refinitiv bid possible, since it has a strong share price to use as currency, said Chris Turner, a senior equity analyst at Berenberg. The planned purchase, agreed with Refinitiv's shareholder \uc2 Blackstone Group\uc2 , shot \uc2 LSE\uc2  stock up 30%.\par \par \uc2 "That's the problem for Hong Kong exchange. Now you need to pay a premium over that premium. It's too expensive now for others," Mr. Turner said.\par \par \uc2 Alexander Osipovich and Caitlin Ostroff contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Margot Patrick at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:margot.patrick@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 margot.patrick@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020190913ef9d001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc35}{\*\bkmkend toc35}{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw16\pich17\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal240\pichgoal255

Higher speeds and reduced lag time will pave the way for new businesses, experts say. Corporate venture firms whose parent companies are racing to deploy the technology are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-small-5g-related-companies-that-investors-should-watch-11551236401"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 placing early bets }}}\uc2  on these startups.\par \par \uc2 Chris Bartlett, the head of \uc2 Verizon Communications Inc\uc2 .'s Verizon Ventures, joined WSJ Pro Venture Capital to discuss his firm's approach to investing in 5G-related startups. Here are edited excerpts:\par \par \uc2 What is Verizon Ventures' investing strategy when it comes to 5G?\par \par \uc2 We want to get a couple things out of investments. The first is simply insight and knowledge that we can bring back to our business units. 5G is just one element of \uc2 Verizon\uc2 's strategies. It's a key part of our venture investing\u8212\'20\'14supporting the evolution of the 5G ecosystem and the various use cases that might develop.\par \par \uc2 We certainly don't have a crystal ball, but we think some use cases could be more industrial- or business-focused than in previous wireless technology cycles, such as 4G.\par \par \uc2 Are there startups in your portfolio that are completely dependent on 5G?\par \par \uc2 The short answer is yes. Recently we've invested in a couple of companies that I would say are aligned, by either hardware or software, to our 5G deployment. And then there are others, like the last handful of investments we've made, that are more tangentially related [to 5G]. Many are network- or connectivity-centric and make our core network more efficient.\par \par \uc2 Can you talk about the balance of deciding whether it is too early to invest in a startup that needs a 5G network to do what it wants to do?\par \par \uc2 We're very much prepared to make investments in businesses that are developed specifically for 5G or beyond use cases. And sometimes there's a dearth of those, because people are still building solutions that are architected for 4G-type connectivity.\par \par \uc2 Given where we sit here at \uc2 Verizon\uc2 , I would think we have the best insight into what 5G is actually going to enable. I think the challenge is that the software and platforms just don't exist yet to take advantage of the currencies and the low latencies of 5G.\par \par \uc2 Some founders are spooked by the idea of taking corporate venture capital. They say it's like handing over their keys to a competitor. With 5G's potential and technical nature, how are those concerns discussed within your team?\par \par \uc2 I think the sources of concern have been less around what you described and more around, "Does the corporate strategy change and therefore you're not going to support us anymore?" Candidly, our corporate strategy has been pretty consistent with a network centricity.\par \par \uc2 The benefit of getting access to our technologists, our presence, our customers, our distribution ultimately outweighs concerns [founders] have about their IP. We're able to turbocharge their business with our resources.\par \par \uc2 So far, the virtual-reality sector hasn't transformed the media and entertainment landscape as many thought it would, and venture capital has been slowing. Is 5G the missing link?\par \par \uc2 The adoption curve on [VR] has been slower to develop. But many of those are very consumer-leaning applications for virtual reality. I think the use cases more likely to take will be less sexy, such as augmented reality for industrial use and real-time industrial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , for example.\par \par \uc2 I do think 5G in many cases is the linchpin and there will be an earlier adoption curve on the industrial side versus the consumer side for AR/VR.\par \par \uc2 Write to Marc Vartabedian at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:marc.vartabedian@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 marc.vartabedian@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20190912ef9c000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It counts Sephora, Fossil and Shop.com among its clients.\par \par \uc2 Current investors in the company, including Alven Capital, Partech Ventures and Salesforce Ventures, also participated in the funding round, alongside Stephan Dietrich, an Akeneo director.\par \par \uc2 The fresh capital follows a $13 million funding round from Partech and Alven in 2017. Last December, \uc2 Salesforce Ventures\uc2  and Mr. Dietrich also supplied capital to the company. Mr. Dietrich joined the Akeneo board at that time.\par \par \uc2 Steffan Peyer, a principal on Summit's London team, said the latest funding round brings the total amount of capital raised by the company to around $60 million. He said that Summit was attracted to the company because of its place in the product information management sector\u8212\'20\'14where software providers help retailers ensure a positive customer experience through data management and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The company has already grown through at least one acquisition. In January Akeneo said it bought Sigmento, an Israeli company that focuses on product-data automation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Peyer said that Summit aims to help expand the company's sales and marketing team and expand internationally\u8212\'20\'14particularly in the U.S., where the company sees unmet demand.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the company has earmarked the capital for product development, including integrating its software with \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -powered data, Mr. Peyer said.\par \par \uc2 Summit Partners\uc2 ' investments range from growth equity and venture capital to credit and public equity, according to the firm's website. For growth investments the Boston-based firm generally invests $10 million to $500 million per company across health-care and life sciences businesses and technology companies, among other growth-oriented enterprises.\par \par \uc2 In March, Summit announced it had {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/summit-partners-raises-4-9-billion-for-latest-growth-fund-11551822301"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 raised $4.9 billion }}}\uc2  for its latest flagship fund.\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20190912ef9c00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The funding of lawsuits by uninvolved third parties became more commonplace in the late 1990s. In recent years, the strategy has become more popular as the returns it generates aren't tied to the broader markets.\par \par \uc2 "Litigation finance returns are uncorrelated and as an asset class are very high yield, which is one reason the fund is attractive to institutional investors," said Eva Shang, Legalist's co-founder and chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Shang declined to comment on the returns the firm's first fund generated. That vehicle {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vcs-back-tech-driven-litigation-finance-1503574201"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 closed with $10.25 million }}}\uc2  in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Financing lawsuits can be high risk. If a case is unsuccessful, the backers of the litigation stand to lose their entire investment.\par \par \uc2 Other organizations that have raised money to finance legal disputes include London-based \uc2 Burford Capital Ltd\uc2 ., a publicly traded firm which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/muddy-waters-claim-sees-shares-in-litigation-finance-firm-tumble-11565178688?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=7"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 came under attack }}}\uc2  last month from short seller Muddy Waters Research. Longford Capital Management LP, whose investors include Jeffrey Vinik, owner of the National Hockey League's \uc2 Tampa Bay Lightning\uc2 , closed its second litigation fund {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/litigation-funder-longford-raises-500-million-as-industry-surges-1505707261?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=6"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 at $500 million }}}\uc2  in 2017 with a strategy to fund corporate lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Shang said that despite the substantial step-up in fund size, Legalist will continue focusing on smaller cases, as there are fewer competitors in this segment of the market. Burford, for example, usually works with larger companies including members of the Fortune 500, according to its website.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco-based Legalist prefers to support small businesses that typically lack the cash reserves to finance potentially expensive litigation battles and would rather use the money to expand.\par \par \uc2 "Technology allows Legalist to fund \u8216\'20\'18David versus Goliath' cases brought by small businesses," said Ms. Shang.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the firm saw applications for around $1 billion of litigation financing, she added.\par \par \uc2 A recent example of successful litigation financed by Legalist's first fund involved a dispute between a Massachusetts-based maker of ice-cream sandwiches and a vendor, in which the manufacturer said sold it poor-quality ice cream. A firm spokesman said it made a profit from funding this case.\par \par \uc2 Legalist also differs from most of its peers in that it uses computer algorithms to assess which cases to back. Most firms have lawyers which review cases by hand.\par \par \uc2 The algorithms used to assess state and federal court cases takes into account the reputation of the presiding judge or appeals court for being plaintiff-friendly or defense-friendly, among other factors, when deciding which cases to back.\par \par \uc2 The company recently hired former U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Richard A. Posner as an adviser. Mr. Posner will be responsible for helping with outreach, and his long legal resume helps establish the firm's credibility with lawyers, Ms. Shang said. Both Ms. Shang and Legalist's other co-founder, Christian Haigh, lack legal backgrounds.\par \par \uc2 Alongside its two founders and Mr. Posner, the firm employs two attorneys and four engineers.\par \par \uc2 Legalist's two founders dropped out of Harvard in 2016 and were originally planning on setting up a legal \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company. A meeting with the general counsel at \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator, introduced the duo to the concept of litigation financing and set them on the path to founding Legalist.\par \par \uc2 Write to Will Louch at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:william.louch@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 william.louch@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20190912ef9c000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Hong Kong's stock exchange threw a wrench into \uc2 Blackstone Group\uc2 's planned sale of Refinitiv Holdings to the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  with a $36.6 billion bid for the LSE that depends on the Refinitiv deal being scrapped. But \uc2 Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd\uc2 . faces some significant hurdles, including possible resistance from U.K. regulators. Blackstone may not be sweating this one just yet.\par \par \uc2 In other news, this morning Laura Cooper writes that Summit Partnershas led a $46 million investment round in French software provider Akeneo SAS, a software provider that serves retailers and brands, while Luis Garcia writes of a new investment by a firm called Indigena Capital, which backs tribal businesses across North America.\par \par \uc2 And the deadline to nominate deserving candidates for our Women to Watch list is rapidly approaching.

Akeneo, based in Nantes, France, is a technology company whose software helps merchants and product managers collect and sort product information to distribute it to sales and e-commerce channels. It counts Sephora, Fossil and Shop.com among its clients. Current investors in the company, including Alven Capital, Partech Ventures and Salesforce Ventures, also participated in the funding round, alongside Stephan Dietrich, an Akeneo director.\par \par \uc2 Indigena Capital Backs Canadian Tribe's Agriculture Business\par \par \uc2 Indigena Capital, an investment firm backing tribal businesses in North America, made its first deal in the agriculture sector with plans to help Canada's Blood Tribe expand a field-crop processing and export enterprise, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/indigena-capital-backs-canadian-tribes-agriculture-business-11568286000?mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Luis Garcia write for WSJ Pro }}}\uc2 .

This gives \uc2 SmileDirectClub\uc2  a market capitalization of $8.9 billion before it expects to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday. The startup received backing at a $3.2 billion valuation last year from \uc2 Clayton, Dubilier & Rice\uc2 , \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2  and Spark Capital. Now, it will be the first to complete an initial public offering out of a growing group of startups such as Candid Care Co. and Uniform Teeth that are challenging the traditional orthodontics business.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone Closes Record Real-Estate Fund at $20.5 Billion\par \par \uc2 Blackstone Group Inc\uc2 . has raised the largest commercial real-estate fund ever, with $20.5 billion of commitments despite an increasingly tough commercial property market, the Journal reports. The giant investment firm, which had $153.6 billion in real-estate assets under management at the end of the second quarter, has been the world's leading real-estate fundraiser. Before it closed the most recent global fund, Blackstone accounted for five of the top 10 largest real-estate funds ever raised, according to data firm Preqin Ltd. Its previous real-estate fund, which closed in 2015, raised $15.8 billion, which was the record until now.\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 $9.406 Trillion\par \par \uc2 Total estimated U.S. residential mortgage debt at the end of June, surpassing the record $9.294 trillion peak reached in 2008 and adding to pressures on consumer spending this year, according to BDO USA LLP\par \par \uc2 Deals\par \par \uc2 Hong Kong Exchange's LSE Bid May Derail Blackstone's Refinitiv Deal\par \par \uc2 Blackstone Group Inc\uc2 .'s sale of Refinitiv Holdings Ltd. may be thwarted by the Hong Kong stock exchange's unsolicited $36.6 billion bid to buy its London-based rival in a deal that would unite two of the world's major trading hubs when both are under severe political pressure. A Blackstone-led group acquired Refinitiv from \uc2 Thomson Reuters Corp\uc2 . in a deal announced last year and last month said it would sell the business to the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  for $14.5 billion in stock. But the bid to combine the Hong Kong and London exchanges may founder. The LSE reacted skeptically, calling it "preliminary and highly conditional," while reaffirming its commitment to the Refinitiv transaction.\par \par \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . has acquired a majority stake in Burning Glass International Inc., a Boston company that does business as Burning Glass Technologies and provides real-time labor-market data. The New York firm bought the stake through its Global Impact strategy, which targets businesses that can help meet United Nations sustainable development goals.

Seller Providence Equity Partners acquired the interest in Burning Glass through its Providence Strategic Growth arm in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Permira\uc2 -backed software company \uc2 TeamViewer GmbH\uc2  has set a price range of \u8364\'20\'AC23.50 to \u8364\'20\'AC27.50 per share ($25.87 to $30.27) for its initial public offering, which is expected to commence Thursday and could raise more than $2.54 billion. As many as 84 million shares may be sold, including 9 million to cover potential over allotments and 15 million that may be added to the initial 60 million to be sold by current shareholders, the company said. The shares will be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with the trading ticker of TMV. The Goeppingen, Germany-based company began operations in 2005 and provides secure remote access products for small to mid-size businesses, with installed products on more than 2 billion devices world-wide. \uc2 Permira\uc2  acquired \uc2 Teamviewer\uc2  for \u8364\'20\'AC870 million in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Luminate Capital Partners in San Francisco has made a growth investment in MSI Data LLC, a provider of cloud-based field service management software founded in 2010.

Finrock's Girish Pashilkar, a managing director of the firm, as the company's new chief executive to take advantage of his experience running growing software businesses.

Bollor\u233\'00\'E9 said the sale is expected to generate about \u8364\'20\'AC115 million ($126.6 million) in cash, and a consolidated capital gain of around \u8364\'20\'AC85 million. The firm initially invested in Wifirst in 2006 and said the company has averaged 30% annual growth over the past decade, expanding to about 600,000 network access points.

In 2016, Perella Weinberg agreed to combine with Tudor Pickering to create a firm with more than $12 billion in assets under management. Tudor Pickering became the firm's energy sector arm. The spinout creates an employee-owned firm based in Houston with all remaining energy asset management strategies of Perella Weinberg, according to a news release. Backers of the new firm include Mr. Tudor and Mr. Holt, while Mr. Pickering becomes a senior adviser to Tudor Pickering.\par \par \uc2 People\par \par \uc2 T. Boone Pickens Jr., an oil prospector and pioneer in hostile takeovers whose folksy wit made him one of America's most recognizable business leaders, has died at age 91. Mr. Pickens rose to fame as founder and chief executive of Mesa Petroleum Corp., where he was an advocate for shareholder rights who liked to vilify the excesses of "Big Oil". A trained geologist from Oklahoma, he was little known outside of energy circles until 1968, when he made the first of a string of unsolicited bids for much-larger oil companies. He later claimed the idea for a hostile takeover came to him in the shower, after a friendly overture was turned down. "It has become cheaper to look for oil on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange than in the ground," he said at the time.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone Group Inc\uc2 . has hired Raymond Chan as a managing director on its \uc2 Blackstone Alternative Asset Management\uc2  portfolio management and investment research team. He was most recently a managing director in the global portfolio solutions unit of \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., having spent 15 years with the white-shoe Wall Street bank. The Blackstone unit's funds manage more than $10.5 billion in assets, including through a daily liquid mutual fund, which Mr. Chan will help oversee.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20190912ef9c0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

But he added that those institutions would nevertheless benefit from fiscal help. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve could see more dissenting votes if it meets expectations with a quarter-percentage-point rate cut next week. In Europe, investors are paring back back their expectations for quantitative easing. And JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon said his bank is discussing how it might respond if interest rates fall to zero or lower.\par \par \uc2 Now on to today's news and analysis.\par \par \uc2 Top News\par \par \uc2 BOE's Carney: Central Banks Have Weapons to Fight Next Downturn\par \par \uc2 The world's major central banks still have the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boes-carney-central-banks-have-weapons-to-fight-next-downturn-11568126242?mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ability to respond }}}\uc2  to a normal economic downturn, \uc2 Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney\uc2  said, but added they would likely need some help from government spending and taxation policies if trouble did happen. The possibility of a slowdown has gone up around the world and downside risks to the outlook have increased, Mr. Carney said in New York.\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan CEO Dimon Raises Specter of Zero Rates\par \par \uc2 The biggest bank in the U.S. is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-ceo-dimon-raises-specter-of-zero-rates-11568147683?tesla=y&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 starting to prepare }}}\uc2  for how to make money if interest rates in the U.S. drop to zero. James Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said at an industry conference the bank has begun discussing what fees and charges it could introduce if interest rates go to zero or lower.\par \par \uc2 Derby's Take: Powell May Score Himself a Hat Trick of Dissent\par \par \uc2 By Michael S. Derby\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could face his biggest formal insurrection yet next week if the central bank lowers rates by a quarter percentage point as it is widely expected to do.\par \par \uc2 A vote to drop the overnight target rate range to between 1.75% and 2% could generate three dissenting votes.

The banks quite rightly fret that lower rates hit their profits, and they want the ECB to help. To avoid trouble in future, it should," writes WSJ's James Mackintosh. "Negative rates are clearly bad for banks in principle, lowering lending rates while deposit rates remain stuck at zero. That squeezes profits. Worse, the ECB now thinks negative rates didn't even have that much effect on the economy or prices. Risking damaging the financial system for tiny moves toward its repeatedly missed inflation goal seems like a mistake."\par \par \uc2 Investor Hopes for Cheaper Money in Europe Dim\par \par \uc2 A month ago, investors were betting the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  would make a splash. Now they're not so sure. Economists broadly expect the ECB on Thursday to reduce its key rate by at least 10 basis points on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 But expectations for the size of the monthly bond-purchase program that might also be announced have been eroding, a move that has helped keep once free-falling bond yields in place this month.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Job Openings Cool in Slowing Labor Market\par \par \uc2 The number of job openings decreased in July from a year earlier for the second consecutive month, underscoring slowing demand for new workers, though opportunities remain plentiful for job seekers. Job postings fell 3% from a year earlier in July to 7.217 million after declining 2% in June, the Labor Department reported. Before June, job openings hadn't decreased year over year since early 2017.\par \par \uc2 Median U.S. Household Income Showed No Growth in 2018\par \par \uc2 American incomes remained essentially flat in 2018 after three straight years of growth, according to Census Bureau figures released Tuesday that offer a broad look at U.S. households' financial well-being. Median household income was $63,179 in 2018, an uptick of 0.9% that census officials said isn't statistically significant from the prior year based on figures adjusted for inflation.\par \par \uc2 Weak Swedish Inflation Pours Cold Water on \uc2 Riksbank\uc2 's Hike Plan\par \par \uc2 The weakness of Swedish inflation in August pours even more cold water over the \uc2 Riksbank\uc2 's forecasts for an interest-rate hike over the next six months and Capital Economics still thinks that policy makers will cut interest rates later this year. CPIF inflation, which excludes the direct effects of interest-rate changes, slowed from 1.5% in July to a 35-month low of 1.3% in August. The weakness of domestic activity is likely to keep a lid on underlying inflation pressures over the rest of this year and throughout 2020, Capital Economics adds.

That includes investors," writes WSJ's Justin Lahart. The 2018 median household income figure of $63,200 reported Tuesday by the Census Bureau "was basically even with what the adjusted data show for 1999. Considering that the U.S. economy grew by an inflation-adjusted 48% over the same period, that is more than striking. It reflects shifts in the economy by which upper-income tiers are capturing more of the economy's gains." Mr. Lahart adds that inequality may change how the economy works, citing Karen Petrou, who runs policy-analysis firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "Rich people are less likely than others to spend additional income, for example, leading to reduced growth and inflation. And because the rich tend to invest that extra money instead, it can lead to increased asset prices," he writes.\par \par \uc2 What a Real Credit Crackdown Looks Like\par \par \uc2 "An emerging-market economy with a population of over a billion is recording its slowest growth rates in years, triggered by a crackdown on rampant nonbank lending. No, not that one," Mike Bird writes for the Journal. "India is demonstrating how a sharp squeeze on shadow finance\u8212\'20\'14credit from outside traditional banking\u8212\'20\'14can feed quickly through to an economic slowdown when the crackdown hits multiple key sectors at once. Other countries, particularly India's large and credit-driven neighbor to the northeast, should take heed."\par \par \uc2 Basis Points\par \par \uc2 * The number of Americans without health insurance climbed to 27.5 million in 2018, according to federal data that show the first year-to-year increase in a decade, before the Affordable Care Act began reducing the ranks of the uninsured.\par \par \uc2 * Health insurers are expected to pay out a record $743 million to consumers this month under an Affordable Care Act rule that requires refunds if the companies don't spend a big enough share of premium dollars on health care.\par \par \uc2 * American companies are downshifting in China as its economy slows and trade tensions with the U.S. persist, according to a new survey that highlights softening revenue, reduced investment and job cutbacks.\par \par \uc2 * Beijing has tried a variety of measures in recent weeks to bump up the pork supply and bring down prices after a yearlong outbreak of African swine fever decimated the country's hogs.

Federal agencies and government contractors are now barred from using software and products developed by \uc2 Kaspersky Lab\uc2  under a rule that went into effect Tuesday. WSJ Pro's James Rundle breaks down what it means.\par \par \uc2 Also today: U.S. chip makers wait for permission to sell to Huawei; EU lines up tech enforcers; and U.S. tech firms and other companies urge Congress to create a federal privacy law, though probably not one as strict as Europe's GDPR.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Government\uc2  Formalizes Kaspersky Ban\par \par \uc2 By James Rundle\par \par \uc2 Washington has formally barred federal agencies and contractors from using software developed by Russian cybersecurity company \uc2 Kaspersky Lab\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 What has happened?\par \par \uc2 The Defense Department, \uc2 National Aeronautics and Space Administration\uc2  and \uc2 General Services Administration\uc2  issued a rule, published Tuesday in the Federal Register, that formalizes an interim ban in place since 2017. That year, the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  barred government agencies from using the Moscow-based company's products. Legal authority for the ban was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018.\par \par \uc2 Who is affected?\par \par \uc2 All federal agencies, civilian and military. Federal contractors and subcontractors of all sizes are also bound by this rule.\par \par \uc2 Why is this happening?\par \par \uc2 The federal government is concerned that using \uc2 Kaspersky Lab\uc2  products introduces an unacceptable risk that Russian government or military personnel could use the software to access U.S. systems. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2017 that the Russian government has used the company's antivirus software to scan computers around the world for \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  documents.\par \par \uc2 What does Kaspersky say?\par \par \uc2 A spokesperson for Kaspersky told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity that the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act "were unconstitutional, were based on unsubstantiated allegations, and lacked any public evidence of wrongdoing by the company."\par \par \uc2 How should companies respond?\par \par \uc2 A company of any size that deals with the federal government, even with nonsensitive systems, must immediately cease using Kaspersky software and remove it, the final rule states, in line with an interim rule adopted in July 2018. There are no grace periods. The federal government awarded contracts to more than 93,000 companies in both 2017 and 2018, the three agencies said, adding they expect the ban to affect thousands of companies, which are obliged to report any instances where the software is found.\par \par \uc2 Will it be difficult?\par \par \uc2 Removing software is a relatively trivial matter, said Chris Morales, head of security \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at security firm Vectra AI Inc., but it can be an onerous process to select a new vendor. While there are alternatives to Kaspersky, most contractors would require testing and evaluation periods, he said.\par \par \uc2 Joseph Carson, chief security scientist at security firm Thycotic Software LLC, said that such changes can also result in server downtime, and in some cases, periods when company systems are open to hackers.\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 21%\par \par \uc2 Percentage of U.S. adults who have experienced ransomware on a personal or work device, according to a Harris Poll, sponsored by security firm Anomali Inc., of 2,000 individuals.\par \par \uc2 More Cyber News\par \par \uc2 EU commissioner who targeted tech giants gets second term. The \uc2 European Union\uc2  official overseeing the regulatory push against Silicon Valley is poised to stay on the job for an unexpected second term\u8212\'20\'14a warning that the new administration here isn't backing down on global tech oversight, The Wall Street Journal reports.\par \par \uc2 Gasps: Incoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen 's decision to keep \uc2 Margrethe Vestager\uc2  as the competition chief\u8212\'20\'14while also giving her a new, wider portfolio to guide European rule-making related to the digital economy\u8212\'20\'14was met by audible gasps from staffers and journalists at a news conference Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Remember that clawback? Ms. Vestager made a name for herself by imposing record antitrust fines on U.S. tech companies, including a total of $9.4 billion on \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2 . She also ordered Ireland to claw back $15 billion from \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . in what the commission called unpaid taxes.\par \par \uc2 Chip makers still await clearance to sell to Huawei. More than two months after President Trump agreed to ease export restrictions on \uc2 Huawei Technologies Co\uc2 ., the U.S. has yet to green-light any sales to the Chinese telecom giant, WSJ reports. The Huawei blacklist, which went into force May 16, cut U.S. chip makers off from a pipeline that enabled them to send $11 billion worth of components to Huawei last year.\par \par \uc2 No licenses yet: President Trump, meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 29, agreed to ease the blacklist for cases that didn't involve national security. But the Commerce Department has yet to grant any licenses for restricted sales. U.S. chip makers stand to lose billions of dollars in revenue. A spokesman for the Commerce Department said it is reviewing applications from Huawei suppliers, which can require input from the Defense, State and Energy departments.\par \par \uc2 51 companies petition Congress for federal data privacy law. Chief executives of 51 technology firms want federal action on data privacy to supersede a collection of differing state laws, according to an open letter to Congress Tuesday. Local laws, plus requirements from regulatory bodies, make privacy compliance difficult for the companies, but skeptics question whether the firms would lobby to weaken any strict provisions, ZDNet reports.\par \par \uc2 Among the signers: Amazon, \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2 , \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , \uc2 American Express\uc2 , \uc2 AT&T\uc2 , Dell and SAP.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20190911ef9b0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 . agreed to buy \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  nearly three years ago, it promised to create an entertainment and advertising behemoth that could take on Silicon Valley giants like \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Netflix Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now, the telecom giant is under pressure to deliver.\par \par \uc2 Elliott Management Corp\uc2 ., the activist investor that disclosed a stake in \uc2 AT&T\uc2  on Monday, said in a letter to the company that it has "failed to articulate a clear strategic rationale" for the $80 billion-plus \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  acquisition.\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2  had told Wall Street and regulators that \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  -- which was re-christened \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2  -- would help it launch into the streaming-video wars, boost its traditional wireless and pay-TV services and build up an advertising-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business that could benefit the TV industry broadly.\par \par \uc2 But Elliott said that when it comes to direct-to-consumer streaming, there is a "growing sense that \uc2 AT&T\uc2  doesn't have a plan," given recent shifts in strategy. And it said the departure of top \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  executives leaves the company without necessary media expertise at a critical moment in the industry.\par \par \uc2 "While it is too soon to tell whether \uc2 AT&T\uc2  can create value with \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 , we remain cautious on the benefits of this combination," Elliott said. The investment firm called for \uc2 AT&T\uc2  to focus more on execution, rather than acquisitions, and divest itself of any noncore assets across its business.\par \par \uc2 A lengthy antitrust battle with the Justice Department, which only came to a close in February, significantly slowed \uc2 AT&T\uc2 's ability to integrate \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 . In a statement, \uc2 AT&T\uc2  said Monday that it is already executing many of the actions outlined by Elliott.\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest priorities for \uc2 AT&T\uc2  is launching a new direct-to-consumer streaming service to compete with \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and other rivals. The company initially laid out plans to offer a three-tiered platform, with an entry-level option focused on movies and additional tiers with the premium \uc2 HBO\uc2  Now and \uc2 Warner Bros\uc2 . programming. \uc2 AT&T\uc2  initially said the service would launch in late 2019.\par \par \uc2 By this summer, the company had shifted to focus on a single offering, \uc2 HBO\uc2  Max. "This quick reversal has intensified the skepticism around \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2 , its OTT [direct-to-consumer] strategy and the management of the business itself," Elliott said.\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2  now says there will be a limited or "beta" launch late this year, with a broad commercial launch next spring, after rival offerings from \uc2 Walt Disney Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . have already hit the market.\par \par \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2  executives counter that while there have been tweaks to the strategy, it isn't fair to say there is "confusion" and a "lack of plan," as Elliott claimed. The long antitrust battle against the government slowed the company down, the executives said, and \uc2 AT&T\uc2  plans to lay out its strategy at an investor meeting at the end of October.\par \par \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2  has unveiled a large number of original TV shows and movies for \uc2 HBO\uc2  Max as well as reacquiring key library content including reruns of the hit comedy "Friends." It hasn't yet announced a price for the service, but it is likely to cost slightly more than the $14.99 average price for \uc2 HBO\uc2  Now, a person familiar with the matter has said.\par \par \uc2 Disney\uc2  earlier this year said its streaming service, Disney+, would launch in November and cost $6.99 a month. Apple TV+ will cost $4.99 a month starting Nov. 1, the company said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 After prevailing in the antitrust fight, \uc2 AT&T\uc2  moved to break down the corporate walls and fiefs at \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2 , leading to the exits of the top executives at the \uc2 HBO\uc2  and Turner divisions this spring. AT&T Chief Executive \uc2 Randall Stephenson\uc2  had earlier said he wasn't looking to change the culture of \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2  nor the leadership at key units.\par \par \uc2 The executive \uc2 AT&T\uc2  picked to lead \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2 , \uc2 John Stankey\uc2 , has since emerged as the likely successor to Mr. Stephenson.\par \par \uc2 "For a content business now owned by a telecommunications company and under the direct supervision of a lifelong telecom executive, this lack of continuity in leadership presents a real concern for investors," Elliott said.\par \par \uc2 While some senior executives such as \uc2 HBO\uc2  head \uc2 Richard Plepler\uc2  have left the company, \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2  has also brought in new management including Robert Greenblatt, former NBC and Showtime programming chief, as chairman of WarnerMedia entertainment.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, \uc2 WarnerMedia\uc2  unveiled a new distribution unit for its cable channels -- a continuation of the combining of the \uc2 HBO\uc2  and Turner units under one umbrella.\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2  also said it would upend the $70 billion traditional television-advertising market, using its reams of data -- on everything from its \uc2 DirecTV\uc2  subscribers to where its customers take their phones -- to help advertisers target consumers with ads across their TVs and digital devices.\par \par \uc2 The company's plans put the spotlight on Xandr, the targeted advertising division created when \uc2 AT&T\uc2  acquired ad-tech marketplace \uc2 AppNexus\uc2  for about $1.6 billion in 2018. Cable and satellite TV operators have long promised marketers would be able to target TV commercials to individual homes, but the offering has been slow to catch on. \uc2 AT&T\uc2 's plan has faced hurdles, including privacy and regulatory concerns around how telecommunications and broadband providers may leverage customer data.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  is scrutinizing how \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and other internet-service providers use consumer data for advertising. The agency ordered \uc2 AT&T\uc2 's advertising subsidiary and other companies to provide information on their privacy practices for user data last month. \uc2 AT&T\uc2  said at the time that it would respond appropriately.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20190911000086"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020190911ef9b00096\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Equity incentive awards are one of the more powerful management incentive tools in a private-equity firm's arsenal. By allowing founders and senior management to benefit from equity options in a portfolio company, owners aim to keep management's interests aligned with those of investors. How these options are structured can vary, as do the terms under which they are paid out. Occasionally, the payout, or lack thereof, of these equity incentive options becomes a point of contention between portfolio companies and members of their management teams.\par \par \uc2 This morning, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming writes of one such dispute that prompted the former chairman and chief executive of Solera Holdings to file a suit against the private-equity backed automotive software company. In his lawsuit, \uc2 Anthony Aquila\uc2  alleges that Solera, which is backed by \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2 , illegally withheld more than $100 million in stock options. In other news, L Squared has pledged $60 million to aerospace technology company Raptor Scientific, and oil and gas producer EP Energy is in talks with rival investor groups over restructuring billions of dollars in debt.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the deadline to submit your nominations for our Women to Watch list is just a week away.

The Paris-based startup\u8217\'20\'19s goal is to \u8220\'20\'1Cmake spending at work as easy as it is in our private lives\u8221\'20\'1D by combining prepaid company cards \u8212\'20\'14 with pre-authorised individual limits, of course \u8212\'20\'14 with automatic receipt capture, automated expense reports and integration into companies\u8217\'20\'19 bookkeeping systems.\par \par \uc2 It has lofty ambitions to become the Revolut of expenses for small and medium-sized companies, and already claims to have 1,500 business clients including other early-stage startups such as \uc2 Seedrs\uc2  in the UK, Doctolib in France and Germany\u8217\'20\'19s Rent24.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 On Monday the company announced it had raised \u8364\'20\'AC35m in a series B funding round led by London-based\u160\'00\'A0 \uc2 Index Ventures\uc2 , which invests in startups such as food-delivery app \uc2 Deliveroo\uc2 , \uc2 Dropbox\uc2 , payments group \uc2 iZettle\uc2  and Revolut.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Spendesk is not the only company targeting this market.\u160\'00\'A0Pleo similarly promises to \u8220\'20\'1Celiminate tedious paperwork\u8221\'20\'1D by offering digital cards, automated receipt catching and the ability to see all staff spending in real-time. \uc2 Expensify\uc2  is well-established in the US and more traditional incumbents such as Concur are improving their technology and user interface.\par \par \uc2 Spendesk has big plans though. Co-founder and chief executive Rodolphe Ardant, an ex-engineer, told the\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Financial Times\uc2  that after growing from 20 staff to 120 in the three years since the company was founded, he wants to hire another 100 staff in the next 12 months and triple revenue annually (although the company won\u8217\'20\'19t say what income it generates now.)\par \par \uc2 Part of the new \u8364\'20\'AC35m\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 which adds to the \u8364\'20\'AC10m raised initially\u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 will be used to open offices in London and Berlin this year and fund expansions into Spain and Scandinavia.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAt the moment the processes to control spending are super tedious \u8230\'20\'26Most companies still manage spending like it\u8217\'20\'19s 1995, with archaic processes like shared company credit cards, petty cash or manual expense reports,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. He says his software can save three days each month on reconciliation tasks alone.\par \par \uc2 To use it, companies top up their accounts on the platform with cash, portions of which can then be authorised for use by staff.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 To validate a payment \u8220\'20\'1Cpeople just need to take a photo of the receipt and an expense report is automatically created and allocated to the right budget \u8230\'20\'26We remove the need for the employee to collect receipts and do all the legwork for reimbursements.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Spendesk takes a monthly fee based on user numbers.\par \par \uc2 But what of the inherent contradiction in the business model: what company wants to make it easier for staff to spend money?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CJust because we are going to make the process easier, that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t mean people are going to spend more,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Ardant says. \u8220\'20\'1CIf you give staff for example an \uc2 American Express\uc2  card, things are much less transparent and companies don't have control.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Spendesk\u8217\'20\'19s software should make it easier for companies to spot fraud, he says, because traditional manual-entry, Excel-based systems are wide open for abuse.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo one can see if you were the one who paid for this receipt\u8221\'20\'1D, especially if you\u8217\'20\'19re using a personal card and claiming it back, he says. \u8220\'20\'1CI have seen a lot of fraud in companies when someone has taken out a friend for lunch, the friend then pays the bill, but you take the receipt back after and claim for it again.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWith our digital, real-time system people can be sure their staff were actually there paying the bill,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Quick fire Q&A\par \par \uc2 Company name: Raisin\par \par \uc2 When founded:\u160\'00\'A02012\par \par \uc2 Where based: Berlin\par \par \uc2 CEO: Dr Tamaz Georgadze\par \par \uc2 What do you sell and who do you sell it to: Raisin is a pan-European marketplace with one-stop access to deposit products from banks in 24 EEA countries, as well as investment and pension products in Germany.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 How did you get started: Raisin\u8217\'20\'19s founders met at McKinsey, noticed the barriers to a harmonised European savings market, and set out to improve this.\par \par \uc2 Amount of money raised so far: \u8364\'20\'AC195m\par \par \uc2 Valuation at latest fundraising: Not disclosed\par \par \uc2 Major shareholders:\u160\'00\'A0Founders, employees, \uc2 Index Ventures\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , PayPal Ventures, \uc2 Orange Digital Ventures\uc2 , Thrive Capital, Ribbit Capital, btov Ventures.\par \par \uc2 There are lots of fintechs out there \u8230\'20\'26what makes you so special:\u160\'00\'A0Raisin allows customers and banks simple, cost-effective access to one another across previously onerous barriers, enabling better saving and investing.\par \par \uc2 Further fintech fascination\par \par \uc2 Follow the money:\u160\'00\'A0US-based life insurer Prudential Financial has spent $2.35bn buying Assurance IQ, a start-up which uses data science and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to speed up the application process for a range of insurance policies,\u160\'00\'A0reports Reuters. The sum could rise by another $1.15bn if Assurance IQ meets its targets.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 New frontiers:\u160\'00\'A0The number of Irish people using fintech products and services has risen three fold since 2017,\u160\'00\'A0says the Irish Times. According to research from consultancy EY, 71 per cent of Irish adults are using some form of fintech service. The global average is 64 per cent. Adoption is being driven by money transfer, insurance, and peer-to-peer payments.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Trend watch: Australian fintech Stake, an equities broker, is planning to target British investors who want to diversify away from the potential chaos of Brexit,\u160\'00\'A0reports the Australian Financial Review. The company has won a licence from the \uc2 UK\u8217\'20\'19s Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  and plans to offer low-fee access to US shares and exchange-traded funds.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Follow the money:\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  has lent $100m to Konfio, a Mexico-based provider of working capital to small and mid-sized companies,\u160\'00\'A0says Bloomberg. The money will help the company to lend about $250m over the next 12 months. Konfio, which uses its technology to analyse credit behaviour, is also hoping to make bigger loans than the current average of $20,000.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 New frontiers: Curve, a UK-based banking platform, has raised a record \u163\'00\'A36m in a crowdfunding drive, with 9500 customers buying as little as \u163\'00\'A310 of equity,\u160\'00\'A0according to Sifted. The company does not particularly need the money though - it raised $55m in a funding round last month.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020190910ef9a005eh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Now that unnecessary heart-stent procedures happen significantly less often, doctors are flagging a new area of concern: unnecessary leg stents.\par \par \uc2 Some physicians are stenting leg arteries and removing plaque at alarming rates, these doctors say. The often-avoidable procedures could put patients at risk of complications and worsening disease.\par \par \uc2 Johns Hopkins\uc2  researchers published a study in June in the Journal of Vascular Surgery analyzing national data from the \uc2 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\uc2  (CMS), the federal agency that administers the Medicare program. The research {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(19)31176-0/fulltext"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 identified 320 physicians}}}\uc2  whose rates for conducting such procedures in patients newly diagnosed with leg pain were 14% or higher. The mean rate of all 5,664 physicians was 3.5%.\par \par \uc2 "We are very concerned about these outlier physicians and the harm they may be inflicting on patients," wrote Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Caitlin Hicks, an assistant professor there, in a letter sent to CMS and the \uc2 Society for Vascular Surgery\uc2  this summer. "Some may represent a serious and immediate threat to public safety."\par \par \uc2 Dr. Hicks says performing unnecessary leg procedures like stenting can make vascular disease worse, creating blockage in narrow arteries or causing an artery to rupture. She says patients with early leg pain have a 1% to 2% risk of limb loss after five years. But aggressive procedures increase that risk to 5% to 10%.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Makary examines the practice of performing unnecessary vascular procedures in a chapter of his new book, "The Price We Pay," published Sept. 10. In it, he describes what seems to be the "predatory" practice of some doctors seeking out patients at health screenings in churches.\par \par \uc2 The doctor adds that no one without real leg symptoms should be screened for conditions in the legs that lead to stenting and ballooning, known as peripheral vascular interventions. "They might tell you we will only screen you if you are having symptoms, but who in the world doesn't have leg pain at some point?"\par \par \uc2 "Almost every 80-year-old in the U.S. has plaque in their leg artery and there is no clinical significance unless you have symptoms," he adds. "But some doctors will balloon and stent any plaque."\par \par \uc2 Kim Hodgson, president of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), a professional association of vascular medical professionals, says the organization is concerned about the overuse of procedures highlighted in the letter from the Hopkins researchers. SVS guidelines recommend peripheral vascular interventions only after patients who have leg pain when they walk have failed medical and exercise therapy and have lifestyle-limiting symptoms.\par \par \uc2 The letter also lists 10 doctors paid by CMS who use atherectomy as the first intervention for peripheral artery disease in 100% of patients. Atherectomy is a procedure that many doctors say should be used selectively, since there's no conclusive data to support its effectiveness, Dr. Hicks says. The minimally invasive procedure often entails using a laser or other device to remove plaque from blood vessels.\par \par \uc2 "Of course there are rare situations when you need to do this, but to do it routinely is a clear-cut, egregious practice pattern," Dr. Makary says.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Hicks says the average rate of atherectomy as a first option was 55% among doctors paid by CMS. There were 114 out of 1,686 doctors with a 100% atherectomy rate and an additional 189 with rates above 90%. The lack of data around the procedure, combined with how much Medicaid reimburses for it, make it "a setup for overuse," she says.\par \par \uc2 Share Your Thoughts\par \par \uc2 Have you, or someone you know, had a leg stent? How has life been with it? Share your experience below.\par \par \uc2 Among vascular surgeons surveyed in their registry, the average rate of atherectomy is about 17%. "We recoiled when we saw 100%, because it goes against everything we know," Dr. Hodgson says.\par \par \uc2 CMS has several tools and programs to ensure that its providers are providing high-quality care, according to an agency statement. The agency also sends comparative billing reports to providers to allow them to compare their billing patterns on specific procedures to peers to hold them accountable. The agency didn't say if it is examining the issues raised in the letter.\par \par \uc2 There can be limitations with drawing conclusions from \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analyses, given the varying degree of health in different patient populations around the country.\par \par \uc2 Pranay Ramdev, a vascular surgeon in Florida, is among the doctors the researchers found to have a 100% atherectomy rate. He says atherectomy as a first-line treatment benefits his patients. He describes them as mostly elderly, with severely blocked arteries or with ulcers or gangrene, and possibly at risk of limb loss due to poor blood flow.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Ramdev agrees that some doctors perform unnecessary peripheral vascular procedures, including atherectomy. But he calls claims that atherectomy isn't effective "utter nonsense."\par \par \uc2 Other doctors say that the volume of these procedures is an inherent problem, as most people with these conditions can manage them with exercise and medication. Sridhar Chatrathi, an interventional cardiologist in Greenbelt, Md., raised the problem of unnecessary leg procedures and church health-fair screenings to Dr. Makary.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Chatrathi says he knows of at least six outpatient vascular labs in his area that do peripheral vascular interventions like stenting. But he says most leg pain isn't related to vascular disease.\par \par \uc2 "When you see this many labs in such a small geographical area, you know there's something fishy," he says.\par \par \uc2 SVS president Dr. Hodgson says patients who make positive lifestyle changes often never need a procedure or can forestall getting one by five to 10 years. This benefits them, because such procedures cause scarring in the blood vessels, which often results in the need for another procedure later. "So we like to start that clock ticking as late in life as possible," he says.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Makary is talking with the SVS about participating in the national {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.improvingwisely.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Improving Wisely program}}}\uc2  he oversees. The program, funded largely by \uc2 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\uc2 , the nonpartisan health nonprofit launched by the family the founded that \uc2 Johnson & Johnson\uc2 , uses CMS data to find outlier doctors. It teams with professional medical associations and confidentially shares information from its nationwide analyses.\par \par \uc2 The group's first campaign helped the American College of Mohs Surgery analyze the number of blocks of tissues surgeons removed during treatment for skin cancer. They sent letters to more than 1,000 Mohs surgeons informing them of their rates. Of the 53 outliers who received the letter, 83% reduced their rates. The $150,000 campaign resulted in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055597"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $11 million CMS savings}}}\uc2  after one year and $27 million two years later.\par \par \uc2 The Doctor Behind Improving Wisely\par \par \uc2 In his new book "The Price We Pay: What Broke American Health Care\u8212\'20\'14And How To Fix It," Marty Makary, a surgeon and professor at Johns Hopkins University, has several chapters that focus on the cost\u8212\'20\'14to patients and the health care system\u8212\'20\'14of unnecessary procedures. He is heading up a national campaign, Improving Wisely, to analyze outlier practice patterns.\par \par \uc2 Here are edited excerpts from a recent interview:\par \par \uc2 In your book you quote a statistic that doctors themselves say that one out of five procedures or services are unnecessary. Are patients being harmed by these unnecessary procedures?\par \par \uc2 Most doctors try to do the right thing. We don't want to create hysteria. But it's important to ask the right questions and often to get a second opinion knowing that a fraction of doctors are responding to a consumerist culture, maybe responding to the perverse payment incentives in our system, or they may not be up on the latest state-of-the-art care.\par \par \uc2 It's good for the public to know that while in many emergency situations you need to follow the advice of your doctor and not mess around, most of health care is elective and non-urgent and for those things it's important to educate yourself.\par \par \uc2 In the first chapter of your book you focus on what you describe as the almost predatory nature of doctors going after patients to do unnecessary vascular procedures. What procedures are they doing?\par \par \uc2 United States Preventive Task Force guidelines help doctors and patients navigate the epidemiological data. And for partial blockages or plaques in the leg arteries, the recommendation is pretty clear doctors should not be fishing for disease in patients without symptoms.\par \par \uc2 How are these doctors going after patients?\par \par \uc2 My team and I met with cardiologists from around the country asking them what they believe to be patterns of overuse in their field. To my surprise, they told me the leg is the new heart and that some doctors are screening patients for plaques in leg arteries even though most older Americans will normally have some small plaque.\par \par \uc2 I asked, are patients referred or do they seek out a cardiologist? One of the cardiologists told me, "No Marty, the doctors go to them." They go and offer free health screenings where these plaques are identified. I was blown away that some of these occur at churches. I couldn't believe that my profession was engaging in what appeared to be predatory screenings.\par \par \uc2 What is the Improving Wisely campaign?\par \par \uc2 The Improving Wisely program, proposed initially with a grant from the \uc2 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\uc2 , creates ways to measure appropriateness using practice patterns. Boundaries are set by experts in the field on what the patterns of overuse are, that can be measured.\par \par \uc2 So in the project people receive their doctor's level\u8212\'20\'14where they stand relative to their peers.\par \par \uc2 Tell us about the problem you identified with skin cancer doctors removing too much skin during surgery and how the Improving Wisely campaign was able to successfully combat that?\par \par \uc2 The impressive leadership of the American College of Mohs Surgeons decided to take on the issue of a pattern of overuse in skin cancer surgery. We generated reports for them and they mailed them out with a cover letter to doctors saying, "As a courtesy we're letting you know where you stand relative to your peers. There's no penalty for your performance but we hope that you will find it helpful."\par \par \uc2 I braced for backlash, but instead I was amazed to see that all of the feedback received was either grateful, neutral or appreciative, which speaks to the value of a physician-defined metric that can be used within the field.\par \par \uc2 What are some examples of other overdone medical procedures that you are tackling?\par \par \uc2 We are now using the Improving Wisely model to address polypharmacy among seniors in the United States, looking at the average number of medications a primary-care physician prescribes to their seniors. While variation is expected, there is a pattern of some doctors having their patients on over 20 medications.\par \par \uc2 What about spine surgery?\par \par \uc2 One opportunity is to apply a metric that spine surgeons have defined, which is the proportion of patients who have elective spine surgery in their practice where the patient has never had at least one physical-therapy visit in the year preceding the operation. When 0% of your elective spine operations for back pain are done without physical therapy in a high-volume practice, that's a surrogate marker of unnecessary back surgery.\par \par \uc2 Write to Sumathi Reddy at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:sumathi.reddy@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sumathi.reddy@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020190910ef9a00335\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 European banks are spending vast sums on technology\u8212\'20\'14but it may not be enough to defend against the incursions of bigger, richer American rivals.\par \par \uc2 U.S. lenders already {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-u-s-banks-took-over-the-world-11567589403"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dominate investment banking}}}\uc2  in Europe. The big risk for the continent's banks is that slicker tech could give their American rivals a platform to make gains in lending to companies\u8212\'20\'14the Europeans' traditional stronghold.\par \par \uc2 This year, Europe's banks plan to make technology investments worth in aggregate $77 billion, according to consulting firm Celent. That compares with $105 billion for their U.S. rivals. Faster, more seamless trading systems have long been a priority, but tech spending has shifted across business lines and from back office to front office. It can cover everything from maintaining decades-old systems to cutting-edge \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, European lenders are more focused on patching old systems. Less than a quarter of their budgets will be spent on new tech this year. U.S. rivals were at that level five years ago and now spend a third on innovation. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 , an early starter, will spend half of its annual $11 billion technology budget on innovation this year.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and other American rivals cleaned up their balance sheets more quickly after the financial crisis, which gave them a head start on competitors in Europe. Their initial tech investments focused on modernizing legacy systems, building platforms to comply with new regulations and automating routine tasks.\par \par \uc2 Over time, more complex tasks have also been automated using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Since 2017, \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  has used a software program to review commercial loans, which the company estimates saved 360,000 hours a year of lawyer and loan officer time.\par \par \uc2 European banks are behind in this process. Hampered by lower interest rates and profits, they have had less cash to spend. They have also contended with additional regulation\u8212\'20\'14most recently the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/large-gdpr-fines-are-imminent-eu-privacy-regulators-say-11556829079"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 new European Union data privacy rules}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2019/06/28/the-digital-revolution-comes-for-banking/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 open banking}}}\uc2  regulation.\par \par \uc2 The Americans' early lead has in turn given them lower transaction costs and more flexible systems, adding to the challenge Europe's banks face as they enter another round of slowing growth and falling interest rates.\par \par \uc2 The digitization of financial services has brought banks everywhere face to face with new competitors. \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2  and Apple are offering selected financial services to their customers, such as credit cards, payment services and inventory loans to \uc2 Amazon\uc2  marketplace sellers. But the tech giants are unlikely to want to become full-scale banks and risk an avalanche of regulation.\par \par \uc2 Small fintech companies are also developing new products, often without the regulatory burden that traditional lenders face. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic are using accelerator programs and other types of partnership to incorporate new fintech products into their offerings. While they may hit on a great new product, any competitive advantage is likely to be short-lived as customers will expect their bank to add that service soon\u8212\'20\'14and won't necessarily be prepared to pay for it.\par \par \uc2 In many cases, European banks may be better off eschewing this arms race, focusing their investment on core capabilities and only offering new products or services once they have proven popular with customers. That would make the most of their limited firepower, even if they linger behind their American rivals.\par \par \uc2 Still, Europe's banks need to defend their core turf of corporate lending to protect vital customer relationships. Ominously, the top five U.S. banks gained three percentage points of commercial-lending market share in Europe, Middle East and Africa between 2015 and 2017, according to consulting firm \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 European banks may already spend more than they would like on technology, but investors shouldn't be surprised if they have to open their wallets even wider.\par \par \uc2 Write to Rochell Toplensky at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:rochelle.toplensdky@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rochelle.toplensdky@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020190910ef9a001jl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

From British shoppers in King's Cross to Hong Kong protesters, people around the world have found themselves under the watchful scrutiny of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Last week a UK court found that police trials of facial recognition technology in Welsh public spaces did not contravene either human rights or data protection laws. This will come as a relief to British police forces which are keen to deploy the technology, despite the lack of a clear government mandate to do so. Yet the enthusiasm is difficult to square with the proven fallibility of current machines, which have been shown to be inaccurate, unreliable and biased. It often fails to do what it says on the tin that is, recognise faces, particularly if those faces belong to women and people of colour.\par \par \uc2 While the courts may have endorsed facial recognition technology, the British public do not. A new survey by the Ada Lovelace Institute found that 55 per cent of people wanted government restrictions on police use of the technology. Respondents were also uncomfortable with its commercial use only 17 per cent wanted to see facial recognition technology used for age verification in supermarkets, 7 per cent approved of its use for tracking shoppers and 4 per cent thought it was appropriate for screening job candidates.\par \par \uc2 When considering facial recognition technology, we need to debate not only what is lawful, but also what is ethical. In order to have that conversation, we should press pause on the further rollout of the technology. Companies should adopt a voluntary moratorium on using it. There is an impressive precedent for this in the insurance industry. In the late 1990s, predictive genetic testing was becoming cheap and accurate enough that it was clear it would become routine practice in diagnostic and healthcare. Efforts to sequence the human genome were accelerating, and "direct-to-consumer" genetic testing was just around the corner.\par \par \uc2 Because the law did not prohibit or limit it, insurance companies could have required customers to disclose the results of any genetic tests and increased their insurance premiums accordingly, or denied coverage altogether. This could have led to discrimination in the pricing or provision of health insurance, as well as life insurance, which in the UK was required to get a mortgage.\par \par \uc2 Rather than exploit this legal gap, the sector chose a different path. In 1998, the \uc2 Association of British Insurers\uc2  adopted a two-year voluntary moratorium on the use of genetic testing in the provision of insurance policies backing mortgages. This was extended in 2001 to include life insurance and critical illness cover. The moratorium was enshrined in an official agreement between the government and the ABI, binding 97 per cent of the UK insurance sector. After repeated extensions, the moratorium this year was formalised into an open-ended, voluntary code on genetic testing and insurance.\par \par \uc2 Companies developing, selling and using facial recognition technology should follow this praiseworthy example. Our research indicates such a move would have popular support. Most people do not want to see facial recognition in schools or on public transport. A large majority 70 per cent told us that companies should voluntarily agree not to sell facial recognition technology to schools, and half support a pause on sales to the police.\par \par \uc2 Given the current political climate, it seems unlikely that governments will intervene to limit the spread of this technology anytime soon. Courageous leadership by the private sector in the form of a voluntary moratorium would buy the space and time needed for genuine public discussion about what type of society we want to build.\par \par \uc2 The writer is director of the Ada Lovelace Institute\par \par \uc2 Most people think companies should voluntarily agree not to sell the technology to schools\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020190909ef990003o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With aging populations around the world, rapid advances in health-care technology could boost some exchange-traded funds focused on the area.\par \par \uc2 That is what Travis Briggs, chief executive officer of Robo Global, is counting on. The firm recently launched an index that features names like \uc2 Tabula Rasa HealthCare\uc2 , a health-care software specialist, and \uc2 Genomic Health Inc\uc2 , which focuses on genetic research to detect cancer. The index is tracked by the new \uc2 Robo Global Healthcare Technology & Innovation ETF\uc2  (HTEC).\par \par \uc2 Technologies like \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  are poised for rapid growth in health care, Mr. Briggs says, with some estimating that health-care AI alone could grow from a business valued at about $2 billion in 2018 to $36 billion by 2025, he says.\par \par \uc2 "That has enormous benefits for patients\u8212\'20\'14and investors," he says.\par \par \uc2 Innovation in health-care technology has driven "a lot of private capital into these areas as investors want to get exposure to companies powering this technological revolution," says \uc2 Neena Mishra\uc2 , director of ETF research at \uc2 Zacks Investment Research\uc2 . We are likely in the early stages of this revolution, she says. She expects to see a number of other funds take a similar approach to HTEC by providing comprehensive exposure to health-care technology, though she notes that there is a range of health-care ETFs that incorporate a strong technological element, some focusing on certain areas within the broader sector.\par \par \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\uc2  operates two such funds: \uc2 SPDR S&P Biotech ETF\uc2  (XBI) and \uc2 SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF\uc2  (XHE). \uc2 Matthew Bartolini\uc2 , a managing director at SSGA and head of SPDR Americas Research, says that health care as a whole has been one of the worst-performing sectors in 2019, thanks to regulatory pressures around drug pricing, insurance and the opioid crisis, which have weighed on the pharmaceutical companies and service providers that dominate the sector.\par \par \uc2 However, health-care-equipment companies have performed better than the sector as a whole, benefiting from structural tailwinds like aging populations and the increased prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity, which have driven demand for medical devices, in-home monitors, implants and other means of long-term care.\par \par \uc2 "While regulatory scrutiny is likely to continue to weigh on other health care sector subindustries, equipment firms may continue to outperform given that their higher projected growth rates stem from structural demand," Mr. Bartolini says.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 .'s iShares business recently launched its "megatrends" ETF framework, which clusters funds together as they relate to a range of key long-term trends. Demographic change and health-care innovation is an important part of this, says Jeff Spiegel, U.S. head of iShares Megatrend and International ETFs, with \uc2 iShares Genomics Immunology & Healthcare ETF\uc2  (IDNA) and \uc2 iShares Robotics & \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial Intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  Multisector ETF\uc2  (IRBO) included in the new framework.\par \par \uc2 The dynamic that investors should realize, says Mr. Spiegel: "By 2035, more people in the U.S. will be older than 65 than there will be people younger than 18."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cowan is a writer in Northern Ireland.

From British shoppers in King's Cross to Hong Kong protesters, people around the world have found themselves under the watchful scrutiny of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Last week a UK court found that police trials of facial recognition technology in Welsh public spaces did not contravene either human rights or data protection laws. This will come as a relief to British police forces which are keen to deploy the technology, despite the lack of a clear government mandate to do so. Yet the enthusiasm is difficult to square with the proven fallibility of current machines, which have been shown to be inaccurate, unreliable and biased. It often fails to do what it says on the tin \u8212\'20\'14 that is, recognise faces, particularly if those faces belong to women and people of colour.\par \par \uc2 While the courts may have endorsed facial recognition technology, the British public do not. A new survey by the Ada Lovelace Institute found that 55 per cent of people wanted government restrictions on police use of the technology. Respondents were also uncomfortable with its commercial use \u8212\'20\'14 only 17 per cent wanted to see facial recognition technology used for age verification in supermarkets, 7 per cent approved of its use for tracking shoppers and 4 per cent thought it was appropriate for screening job candidates.\par \par \uc2 When considering facial recognition technology, we need to debate not only what is lawful, but also what is ethical. In order to have that conversation, we should press pause on the further rollout of the technology. Companies should adopt a voluntary moratorium on using it. There is an impressive precedent for this in the insurance industry.\par \par \uc2 In the late 1990s, predictive genetic testing was becoming cheap and accurate enough that it was clear it would become routine practice in diagnostic and healthcare. Efforts to sequence the human genome were accelerating, and \u8220\'20\'1Cdirect-to-consumer\u8221\'20\'1D genetic testing was just around the corner.\par \par \uc2 Because the law did not prohibit or limit it, insurance companies could have required customers to disclose the results of any genetic tests and increased their insurance premiums accordingly, or denied coverage altogether. This could have led to discrimination in the pricing or provision of health insurance, as well as life insurance, which in the UK was required to get a mortgage.\par \par \uc2 Rather than exploit this legal gap, the sector chose a different path. In 1998, the \uc2 Association of British Insurers\uc2  adopted a two-year voluntary moratorium on the use of genetic testing in the provision of insurance policies backing mortgages. This was extended in 2001 to include life insurance and critical illness cover. The moratorium was enshrined in an official agreement between the government and the ABI, binding 97 per cent of the UK insurance sector. After repeated extensions, the moratorium this year was formalised into an open-ended, voluntary code on genetic testing and insurance.\par \par \uc2 Companies developing, selling and using facial recognition technology should follow this praiseworthy example. Our research indicates such a move would have popular support. Most people do not want to see facial recognition in schools or on public transport. A large majority \u8212\'20\'14 70 per cent \u8212\'20\'14 told us that companies should voluntarily agree not to sell facial recognition technology to schools, and half support a pause on sales to the police.\par \par \uc2 Given the current political climate, it seems unlikely that governments will intervene to limit the spread of this technology anytime soon. Courageous leadership by the private sector in the form of a voluntary moratorium would buy the space and time needed for genuine public discussion about what type of society we want to build.\par \par \uc2 The writer is director of the Ada Lovelace Institute\par \par \uc2 Letter in response to this article:\par \par \uc2 Companies can adopt a voluntary moratorium on facial recognition / From Carly Kind, London, UK\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020190908ef98000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Managing Director Sunny Dhillon said he is especially interested in the grocery and retail sectors as well as the media and entertainment industries.\par \par \uc2 For instance, startups offering e-commerce search optimization and computer vision technology that can inventory store shelves could be attractive as investment targets, Mr. Dhillon said.\par \par \uc2 The firm also is interested in startups using AI to detect and curb altered videos known as "deepfakes," Mr. Dhillon said. At the same time, he said he is interested in the positive uses of deepfake technology, which could be applied in the entertainment industry.\par \par \uc2 Signia's new fund, which closed in December 2018, comes amid strong investor interest in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Venture-capital investment in AI-focused startups rose to $4.9 billion across 139 deals in the second quarter of this year, from $2.6 billion across 153 deals in the second quarter of 2018, according to a PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree report. \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . also plans to focus on AI startups with its second technology megafund, which is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-is-hot-and-softbanks-new-tech-megafund-will-add-money-to-burn-11565184767"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 targeting $108 billion }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Signia's fund, its third investment vehicle, will aim to make around 20 investments of roughly $500,000 to $2.5 million each, Mr. Dhillon said. Signia's previous two funds raised $76.6 million and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/signia-venture-partners-puts-its-own-capital-behind-new-85m-fund-1474552802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $85 million }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Signia, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has notched several notable exits since it launched in 2012. The firm was one of the largest seed investors in Cruise Automation, the autonomous-vehicle startup that was purchased by \uc2 General Motors Co\uc2 . in 2016. Signia also invested in FunPlus, a social gaming startup that sold to Chinese gaming conglomerate Zhongji Investment Holding Co. Ltd. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/08/19/zhongji-buys-major-assets-from-gaming-co-funplus-for-up-to-960m/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in 2014 for about $1 billion }}}\uc2 , and Tenor Inc., which was acquired by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . last year.\par \par \uc2 In conjunction with the new fund, Signia has promoted Linus Liang, previously a principal, to partner. In addition, Mr. Dhillon, a founder and previously a partner, has been named a managing director.\par \par \uc2 With the new fund, Signia plans to ramp up its sourcing of deals outside of Silicon Valley, Mr. Dhillon said. High valuations and the cost of living are among the reasons the firm wants to search for undiscovered talent and startups in locations such as Austin, Texas, Los Angeles and Orange County, Calif., Mr. Dhillon said.\par \par \uc2 "We want to find startups that are not so encumbered by legacy, which you find a lot of in the Valley," Mr. Dhillon said.\par \par \uc2 Signia has made six initial investments to date from its third fund, including leading a $2.5 million investment in Picap Inc., a startup that builds shared mobility software. The firm expects to invest the remainder of the fund over the next two years.\par \par \uc2 Write to Marc Vartabedian at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:marc.vartabedian@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 marc.vartabedian@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20190906ef9600001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The fact that the WeWork parent could seek to go public at less than half the valuation of $47 billion in its last private round raises questions about how private investors had valued it.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street is skeptical about \uc2 We Co\uc2 .'s valuation, and prospective public investors' concerns aren't based solely on the struggles of other recent tech IPOs such as Uber and Lyft. There are longstanding unanswered questions about WeWork's business, which involves renting out office space, renovating it and chopping it up to rent out to other companies. Other real-estate companies in similar businesses have much lower valuations.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2  added to the uncertainty about We's valuation when it bought shares in the company at two different prices early this year. The firm purchased newly issued shares at a $47 billion valuation, but it offered an unusually steep discount to existing employees and investors when it bought some of their shares at a valuation of just $23 billion.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, read on for news of a recent venture deal that involved WeWork\u8212\'20\'14this time as one of the funders.\par \par \uc2 And now on to rest of the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Signia Venture Partners\par \par \uc2 AI focusSignia Venture Partners has raised $85 million for an early-stage venture-capital fund with a particular focus on startups building \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology for traditional industries, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/signia-venture-partners-raises-85-million-for-third-fund-11567764000?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * Managing Director Sunny Dhillon said he is especially interested in the grocery and retail sectors as well as the media and entertainment industries.\par \par \uc2 * Signia's new fund comes amid strong investor interest in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Venture investment in AI-focused startups rose to $4.9 billion across 139 deals in the second quarter of this year, from $2.6 billion across 153 deals in the second quarter of 2018, according to a PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree report.\par \par \uc2 * Signia, based in Menlo Park, Calif., was one of the largest seed investors in Cruise Automation, the autonomous-vehicle startup that was purchased by \uc2 General Motors Co\uc2 . in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Immunity option. IFM Therapeutics LLC has granted \uc2 Novartis\uc2  an option to acquire its IFM Due subsidiary in an agreement worth up to $840 million, its second deal with \uc2 Novartis\uc2  this year, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/novartis-strikes-840-million-deal-with-ifm-therapeutics-11567723214?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports }}}\uc2 . The Boston-based immunotherapy company, whose shareholders include Atlas Venture, Abingworth and \uc2 Novartis\uc2 , runs its drug-development programs through subsidiaries that can be funded\u8212\'20\'14and sold\u8212\'20\'14individually.\par \par \uc2 Lending party. Payments company \uc2 Stripe Inc\uc2 . plans to start lending to some of its customers, building on the extensive data and relationships it has with them, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stripe-joins-square-shopify-others-in-lending-to-small-businesses-11567726232?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports }}}\uc2 . With the launch of Stripe Capital, Stripe joins other payments and software providers such as \uc2 Shopify Inc\uc2 ., which offers Shopify Capital, and Square Inc., with its Square Capital line, that offer loans to their small-business clients. Some venture investors believe the trend will grow, as nonlenders get into the lending game by underwriting their customers based on existing data, such as payments flows.\par \par \uc2 Prove the impact. Impact-investment firms used to face skepticism about whether they can make a profit. Now the challenge is proving they really deliver social or environmental benefits, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/impact-investing-boom-tests-firms-to-prove-positive-change-11567717701?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Chris Cumming reports for WSJ Pro }}}\uc2 . The popularity of ESG creates a "quality-screening issue," according to \uc2 Nancy Pfund\uc2 , founder and managing partner at DBL Partners, a venture-capital impact-investing firm. "I think there is a risk of folks getting into impact investing not because it's their number-one desire, but because it's a way they can raise a fund or get into deals," Ms. Pfund said.\par \par \uc2 WeWork backs furniture rental startup. The co-working provider has made an investment in furniture rental startup CasaOne, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-invests-in-furniture-rental-startup-casaone-11567736432?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Katie Roof reports }}}\uc2 . WeWork invested about $2 million, at a valuation between $100 million and $150 million, one of the people said. WeWork is also a customer of the Emeryville, Calif.-based startup, which is formally known as La Casa Ventures Inc. The investment was made as part of a $16 million financing round led by Silicon Valley venture firm Accel, one of the people said. Other investors in the round included commercial real-estate business \uc2 Jones Lang LaSalle Inc\uc2 . and Array Ventures. WeWork didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Exits\par \par \uc2 Online real estate marketplace Opendoor acquired title and escrow company OS National LLC for an undisclosed amount. In March, San Francisco-based Opendoor secured $300 million in new funding, mostly from SoftBank Vision Fund and General Atlantic, valuing the company at $3.8 billion.\par \par \uc2 One week after raising $51 million in new funding, budgeting software startup \uc2 OpenGov Inc\uc2 . has acquired ViewPoint, which develops multi-tenant SaaS software for permitting and licensing. Weatherford Capital Management and 8VC led \uc2 OpenGov\uc2 's Series D round, which included participation from \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  and others.\par \par \uc2 Publicly traded \uc2 Palo Alto Networks\uc2  agreed to purchase internet of things security provider Zingbox Inc. for $75 million in cash. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company is backed by investors including Dell Technologies Capital, Triventures, GSR Ventures and StartX.\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 Vista Equity raises $16 billion for latest tech buyout fund. \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2  has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-equity-raises-16-billion-for-latest-tech-buyout-fund-11567692100?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 closed a record-breaking technology fund }}}\uc2 , according to people familiar with the matter. The software-focused buyout firm has collected $16 billion of outside capital for the fund.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  lays out challenges of letting users take their data to other platforms. \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . has promised regulators that it will protect users' privacy and give them the right to take their data where they choose. Now the company is trying to figure out how it can do both.\par \par \uc2 Samsung to launch smartphone meant to make blockchain friendlier. \uc2 Samsung Electronics Co\uc2 . is releasing a variant of its newest flagship phone in support of the adoption of next-era technology blockchain, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Slack vs. \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 . Competition is heating up between \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . and its smaller rival \uc2 Slack Technologies Inc\uc2 . as the companies battle in the market for providing software that helps workers communicate. Earlier, Slack shares fell after it warned its growth-pace was slowing.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  disables text-messaging feature as hacks continue. \uc2 Twitter Inc\uc2 . said it was temporarily turning off a feature that allows users to send tweets via text message following a spate of hacks affecting several high-profile users, including the company's Chief Executive \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The most promising careers of the next decade.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Prudential Financial Inc\uc2 . agreed to pay $2.35 billion for an online startup as traditional life insurers seek to reach digital-savvy customers who shop on the internet.\par \par \uc2 Executives of \uc2 Prudential\uc2  said Assurance IQ Inc., a three-year-old company based in Bellevue, Wash., can help it solve a decades-old problem bedeviling many of the biggest names in life insurance: selling to middle-class clients. The 144-year-old \uc2 Prudential\uc2  is the nation's largest life-insurance company by assets.\par \par \uc2 The deal is part of a trend in which traditional life insurers are pairing with what are known as insuretech firms to reach new audiences and benefit from data analysis driven by algorithms.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, venture-capital checks are being written to small companies in nearly every category of the insurance industry. \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . led a $300 million investment round in April for Lemonade Insurance Co., which sells renters' and homeowners' policies online. Clover Health, a San Francisco startup that sells Medicare Advantage health-insurance plans, raised $500 million in January.\par \par \uc2 Assurance sells life, health, Medigap and auto policies online, and it has agents available by phone to help consumers with buying decisions if they want a human to answer questions. The privately held firm currently offers products from more than 20 providers, not including \uc2 Prudential\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Newark, N.J., insurance giant plans to make money initially from the commissions and other fees that Assurance receives from providers, while adding its own products, including life insurance and annuities, to the mix over time.\par \par \uc2 "We think Assurance has cracked the code" to reach consumers whose business is typically too small to make it worthwhile for agents to seek, Prudential Chief Executive Officer \uc2 Charles Lowrey\uc2  said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Assurance uses online advertising and other marketing to attract consumers to its online platforms. The company uses data science and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to assess needs, guide customers to products they can afford and speed up the application process. Those comfortable with buying online can make a purchase that way, or the firm will route customers to an agent if preferred.\par \par \uc2 Prudential\uc2  executives said Assurance can help ramp up sales to a wider selection of households while \uc2 Prudential\uc2 's network of financial advisers will continue focusing on more affluent clients.\par \par \uc2 Shares of \uc2 Prudential\uc2  rose 2.9% to $81.92 on Thursday. The broader insurance sector rallied on the outlook for longer-term interest rates.\par \par \uc2 Some Wall Street analysts cautioned that the $2.35 billion price tag seemed high but said the transaction diversifies \uc2 Prudential\uc2  away from the risks in its core insurance and retirement-income products by delivering a potentially fast-growing stream of fee income. \uc2 Prudential\uc2  said it would provide up to $1.15 billion in additional cash and equity if Assurance meets certain growth objectives.\par \par \uc2 Sales of individual life-insurance policies have fallen about 45% since the mid-1980s to hold steady in recent years at about 9.6 million policies annually, according to Limra, an industry-funded research firm.\par \par \uc2 Many life-insurance agents have left the business over the past couple of decades because of the difficulty of identifying potential buyers for low-cost, term-life insurance.\par \par \uc2 Assurance says its model overcomes this obstacle by linking potential buyers to agents, who can work remotely and with flexible hours. The agents earn lower commissions than if they prospected for customers themselves, said Michael Rowell, CEO of Assurance, but they have "higher, much higher productivity" because they aren't out hunting for customers.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20190906000087"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020190906ef960003g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

LinkedIn's roundup of the top startups to work for includes a few private companies that have raised large venture rounds, as well as some newer names.\par \par \uc2 Several well-known consumer brands made the list, including delivery startup \uc2 DoorDash\uc2 , stock-trading service Robinhood, fitness startup Peloton and real-estate firm Compass. They were joined by other, perhaps less well-known names such as Snowflake Computing, industrial IoT startup Samsara and cannabis company Dosist. Hot startups such as credit card company Brex, self-driving startups Nuro, \uc2 Zoox\uc2  and Aurora also made the list, as well as scooter companies Lime and Bird.\par \par \uc2 LinkedIn used several criteria to select and rank the companies, including employment growth, interest in the company on LinkedIn and ability to attract talent from top companies.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 All cash. Biotechnology startups are usually acquired for a combination of upfront cash and payments based on future succe. That isn't the case in \uc2 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc\uc2 .'s $950 million deal to buy startup Semma Therapeutics Inc., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vertex-makes-another-aggressive-purchase-with-semma-11567553362?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * Vertex is paying all cash to acquire Semma, a developer of potential cell therapy cures for Type 1 diabetes. Semma had raised about $150 million in venture capital from \uc2 MPM Capital\uc2 , F-Prime Capital Partners, \uc2 Medtronic PLC\uc2 , \uc2 Novartis AG\uc2  and others, according to \uc2 Todd Foley\uc2 , an MPM managing director who co-founded Semma in 2014 and served on its board.\par \par \uc2 * Pharmaceutical companies usually seek to reduce the risks of acquisitions by tying some of the payments to milestones, such as securing regulatory approval for a startup's drug. That is particularly true for early-stage biotechs whose treatments won't be on the market for years.\par \par \uc2 * Semma hasn't tested its therapies on humans yet, but in June it presented data from animal studies that illustrated their potential. If Semma's treatments can cure humans, the impact could be dramatic for patients and for companies that make insulin pumps, glucose monitors and other devices used to manage diabetes, Mr. Foley said.\par \par \uc2 Crypto lobby. \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  is putting up a fight against Washington's cryptocurrency crackdown, the Journal's Dave Michaels and Alexander Osipovich report. In late May, at a private conference hosted by the firm for regulators and Treasury officials, \uc2 Marc Andreessen\uc2  compared cryptocurrencies to the early internet and said crypto could solve some of the internet's biggest challenges\u8212\'20\'14if Washington would adopt a less stringent form of regulation. The response wasn't accommodating, according to people who attended. J. Christopher Giancarlo, until recently chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said he warned \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  that crypto regulation couldn't be brushed aside. "Some of the things you learned from your older VCs, this won't transfer," he said.\par \par \uc2 Charitable luxury. Online luxury retail startup Olivela Inc. has raised $35 million in Series A financing, joining other startups with charitable business models in raising funding, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/e-commerce-startup-olivela-looks-to-combine-charity-with-luxury-11567594800?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports }}}\uc2 . Olivela offers an online retail website for luxury fashion and beauty products from brands such as Christian Dior SE and Fendi SRL. The company donates 20% of the proceeds for each purchase to charitable causes. Founder and CEO Stacey Boyd said the charitable-giving program gives Olivela a leg up because younger generations care more about supporting companies that help those in need.\par \par \uc2 New fund alert. Veterans of Versant Ventures and New Enterprise Associates have raised $225 million for the debut fund of Vensana Capital, a new venture- and growth-equity firm focused on medical technology, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. \uc2 Justin Klein\uc2 , who left NEA in December, and Versant's Kirk Nielsen are the managing partners of Minneapolis-based Vensana, which formed early this year. They closed Vensana Capital I LP in late July at its hard cap, Mr. Nielsen said.\par \par \uc2 Cell therapy. Achilles Therapeutics Ltd., a company developing cell therapies to fight solid tumors, said it has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/achilles-therapeutics-eyes-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-cancers-with-new-funding-11567519926?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 raised \u163\'00\'A3100 million }}}\uc2  ($121 million) in a second round of financing which it will use to progress two clinical trials. Proceeds from the investment will go to fund two human studies that will investigate T-cell therapy to target nonsmall cell lung cancer and melanoma. The British company said the Series B round was led by new U.S. investor \uc2 RA Capital Management\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 E-commerce bankruptcy deal. Loot Crate Inc., the "geek and gamer" subscription business backed by actor Robert Downey Jr.'s venture firm, plans to sell itself for more than $30 million to a creditor that will use the debt it is owed as currency. The proposed deal with a Money Chest LLC affiliate will be subject to rival bids in a potential auction supervised by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-loot-crate-gets-creditor-bid-of-more-than-30-million-11567549182?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Becky Yerak reports for WSJ Pro }}}\uc2 .

Van Eck Securities Corp. and SolidX Management LLC on Thursday plan to start selling shares in a limited version of a crypto exchange-traded fund.

The federal indictment announced last week against a driverless-car engineer that accuses him of stealing trade secrets from \uc2 Google\uc2 's parent company before he jumped to a rival is being viewed as a warning to Silicon Valley that prosecutors may scrutinize defections to competitors that involve sensitive technology.\par \par \uc2 No relief for big tech under new EU leadership.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Credit unions are buying small banks in record numbers, a trend that is prompting pushback from the banking industry.\par \par \uc2 Credit unions have acquired 21 U.S. banks since 2018, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, compared with 12 purchases in the prior five years.\par \par \uc2 Bankers say the deals are proof credit unions are growing too aggressively given their not-for-profit business model. Credit unions say they are driven by the same market forces that have driven hundreds of bank mergers in recent years.\par \par \uc2 "We see opportunities to expand our network, bring in new products to the table, and get a good return on investment," said \uc2 Brian Wolfburg\uc2 , the president and chief executive of VyStar Credit Union in Florida, which closed its first bank acquisition in August.\par \par \uc2 Banks have complained for decades that credit unions, which have tax-exempt status, compete with an unfair advantage over financial products such as mortgages, credit cards and business loans while benefiting from weaker regulatory requirements. Banks have lost numerous battles to change regulation and tax treatment of credit unions. Credit unions say their growth helps them extend lower-cost loans and better deposit rates to more consumers.\par \par \uc2 "Credit unions serve the greater good, not the greater greed," said Dan Berger, the president and chief executive of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, a trade group.\par \par \uc2 Credit unions, owned by member-customers, are exempt from corporate taxes and certain lending rules. But they also must serve lower-income households and limit customers to a restricted pool of people who generally work together or live near one another.\par \par \uc2 Credit union and bank tie-ups represent a tiny fraction of the consolidation happening in the industry. There were 187 mergers between credit unions approved in 2018, according to the \uc2 National Credit Union Administration\uc2 , compared with nine announced deals between credit unions and banks.\par \par \uc2 So far this year, credit unions have announced mergers with 12 banks.\par \par \uc2 Credit unions also are smaller overall, holding $1.5 trillion in assets in the first quarter of 2019, compared with $18 trillion for banks and thrifts.\par \par \uc2 Still, the deals illustrate how competitive credit unions have become, given their tax advantages, lack of shareholders and diminishing constraints on growth.\par \par \uc2 "The substantive mission-driven aspects of the credit union charter that are supposed to make them unique and justify many taxpayer benefits have eroded, if not ended," said Karen Shaw Petrou, whose firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 . published a June report on credit unions commissioned by the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Last year, Martin Steele hired an investment bank to field potential buyers for his $206 million-asset firm, The Bank of Washington.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Steele, the Seattle-area bank's president and chief executive at the time, said he received six offers. He chose the one from \uc2 Sound Credit Union\uc2 , in part because it was an all-cash bid and he worried the value of competing stock-based offers from banks could drop before a deal closed.\par \par \uc2 "I've got five friends who I'm saying no to, and I've got a credit union who I've never met before who I'm saying yes to," said Mr. Steele, who now serves as president and chief executive of First Sound Bank.\par \par \uc2 Laura Lee Stewart\uc2 , president and chief executive of Sound Community Bank in Seattle, was one of the bidders that had an existing relationship with Bank of Washington. Ms. Stewart, who is also chairman-elect of the ABA, said the community will lose a tax-income source as a result of the deal.\par \par \uc2 "When an entity is in business doing the same thing and gets a free ride, that's bad public policy," she said. "And it's bad for communities."\par \par \uc2 Sound Credit Union\uc2 , based in Tacoma, Wash., said the acquisition would allow it to expand its services to customers and grow to new markets.\par \par \uc2 "We believe that together, our combined knowledge and experience will better serve our members and communities," Don Clark, president and chief executive of the firm, said in a statement. He added that \uc2 Sound Credit Union\uc2  had paid $3 million in payroll, property and sales taxes in 2018.\par \par \uc2 Credit unions face limits to how they can structure the deals. They must ensure that the customers of the bank they are acquiring will fit into their field of membership and that they won't hit a business-lending limit as a result of the acquisition.\par \par \uc2 NCUA Chairman Rodney Hood said he plans to introduce a rule later this year to clarify credit unions' regulatory responsibilities when acquiring banks.\par \par \uc2 Credit unions should "make sure that they are acquiring a bank that comports with their existing field of membership and the lines of business they are operating in," Mr. Hood said in an interview. The \uc2 NCUA\uc2  and bank regulators generally need to approve these deals before they close.\par \par \uc2 To get around laws prohibiting credit unions from holding bank charters, many of the deals are structured as "purchase and assumptions," in which the bank empties out its loans and deposits and transfers everything over to the credit union.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich446\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal6690

\par\par \uc2 The Property Report\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 Foreigners Pull Out Of Market --- Overseas investors fear U.S. commercial property has hit peak as they shift assets\b0\par\par\uc2 By Esther Fung \par \uc2 838 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 September 2019\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A strong appetite among foreign investors for office buildings, apartments, malls and other real estate has in part fueled the long-running bull market in U.S. commercial property.\par \par \uc2 Now, amid a maturing property market cycle and rising uncertainties in geopolitics and the global economy, foreign investors have sold more U.S. commercial real estate than they bought in a quarter for the first time since 2013.\par \par \uc2 After years of amassing huge portfolios, investors from abroad sold $13.4 billion of property in the second quarter of 2019, according to data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . During the quarter, foreign investors purchased $12.6 billion of real estate.\par \par \uc2 European and Canadian investors have been active sellers recently, along with some high-profile investors from China.\par \par \uc2 "U.S. real estate is priced very high right now, and people think we're close to the top of the market," said Matt Posthuma, a partner in \uc2 Ropes & Gray\uc2 's asset management practice.\par \par \uc2 The waning appetite of foreign investors for U.S. property contrasts with their intensifying interest in other asset classes.\par \par \uc2 Foreign money managers still see U.S. assets as a haven and have been piling into U.S. stocks and bonds, buying nearly $64 billion in these assets in June, the largest sum since August 2018, according to data from the Treasury Department.\par \par \uc2 What's the difference? Compared with buildings, stocks and bonds are easier to buy and sell. If a recession hits, property owners may find it more difficult to sell their assets.\par \par \uc2 "For someone looking out three to five years, their investments may not be worth as much as they are today," Mr. Posthuma said. "That's the fear."\par \par \uc2 Some domestic investors in commercial property also are moving to the sidelines. Overall, sales volume of commercial U.S. property fell 9% in the first quarter of this year from one year ago and rose a modest 2% in the second quarter to $127 billion.\par \par \uc2 For decades, sovereign-wealth funds, insurers, pension funds and family offices across the world have sought assets in the U.S. to diversify their investments and seek steady returns. Many also are drawn to the market's relative stability, vast pool of consumers and deep and liquid market.\par \par \uc2 But, with the dollar strong, overseas investors unloading U.S. assets can chalk up foreign-exchange gains against weaker local currencies along with profits from higher prices. The strong dollar also means buying U.S. property has become more expensive for them.\par \par \uc2 Some investors are shunning investments in flood-prone areas, as rising sea levels and hurricanes amplify costs to mitigate damages, particularly in older buildings.\par \par \uc2 Finding good deals also has become trickier in the U.S. as a possible recession looms and other regional and economic trends -- including the impact of e-commerce on the retail sector -- cast a shadow over some property types.\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest foreign sellers during the second quarter was \uc2 Ivanhoe Cambridge\uc2 , the real-estate arm of Canadian pension fund \uc2 Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec\uc2 , which completed the sale of $2.2 billion worth of properties, according to Real Capital.\par \par \uc2 In the second quarter, \uc2 Ivanhoe Cambridge\uc2  sold two office towers in Seattle and its stake in Ritz Plaza, a 479-unit rental apartment building in Midtown Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 "It's investment discipline," said \uc2 Sylvain Fortier\uc2 , chief investment and innovation officer at \uc2 Ivanhoe Cambridge\uc2 . "When you reached the level you set out at the beginning, don't get greedy. Get out and recycle your money into something else."\par \par \uc2 The Quebec pension fund is focusing more these days on industrial real estate and less on other property types. Late last year, \uc2 Ivanhoe Cambridge\uc2  invested in \uc2 IDI Logistics\uc2 , an Atlanta-based developer and operator of warehouses.\par \par \uc2 In another megadeal in June, Singapore-based investment manager GLP agreed to sell a U.S. network of industrial warehouses, totaling 179 million square feet, to \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2  for $18.7 billion, the largest private real-estate transaction ever. GLP has said it would keep a small footprint in the U.S. and is still looking to expand but didn't provide a timeline.\par \par \uc2 Overseas investors still interested in the U.S. real-estate market are also starting to structure their acquisitions differently.\par \par \uc2 They are choosing to invest in debt rather than equity, which is seen as a safer bet, if the economy slides closer to a recession.\par \par \uc2 They are also taking on more minority stakes to lower the chances of triggering a review by the \uc2 Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S\uc2 ., the country's national-security panel that vets foreign investment in U.S. businesses.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Congress expanded the authority of the panel, known as \uc2 Cfius\uc2 , which has hindered some real-estate transactions if they include land located near a military installation or other sensitive \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  property.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw380\pich372\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5700\pichgoal5580

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Psychedelic substances are gaining legitimacy as a treatment for mental illnesses, prompting a handful of entrepreneurs and venture-capital investors to look for business opportunities in the nascent sector.\par \par \uc2 Still, veteran health-care investors say it is too early to jump into the market given the legal ramifications. Psilocybin, found in "magic mushrooms," has been decriminalized in countries including the Netherlands and Portugal, but remains illegal under U.S. federal law.\par \par \uc2 "We would not invest in something where we were also betting that the illegality would change," said \uc2 Bryan Roberts\uc2 , a partner at \uc2 Venrock Associates\uc2 , one of the oldest venture-capital firms in the U.S. "But we would absolutely invest in something that was utilizing some novel understanding of biology and generating new research into drug development."\par \par \uc2 Partners from Canaan Partners and New Enterprise Associates, both longtime health-care and life-science investors, said the sector isn't even on their radar.\par \par \uc2 Acceptance in the U.S. is growing. Denver effectively decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms in May and Oakland, Calif., followed in June. Research suggests psychedelics could help treat clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions.\par \par \uc2 A few large, well-known startups based in Europe have attracted high-profile investors.\par \par \uc2 Germany-based ATAI Life Sciences AG is using a \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  approach to psychedelic-drug development. U.K.-based Compass Pathways Inc. last year received approval from the \uc2 U.S. Food and Drug Administration\uc2  to run clinical trials to test the use of psilocybin on patients with treatment-resistant depression.\par \par \uc2 ATAI is the largest investor in Compass. Collectively, the two companies have raised about $122 million from investors including billionaires \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  and Michael Novogratz.\par \par \uc2 But some investors and entrepreneurs believe there are many more opportunities to come, as no major pharmaceutical company is developing psilocybin-based drugs.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of reasons to believe this could be the next big thing," said Ronan Levy, who co-founded Field Trip Ventures Inc. this year to invest in startups developing compounds and therapy protocols with psychedelics. "There is a strong grass-roots movement, a general acceptance of the safety profile, and a growing acceptance of the therapeutic value."\par \par \uc2 Firms including Field Trip Ventures, Numinus and Tabula Rasa Inc. -- all based in Canada, where psychedelics are illegal at the federal level -- also say they believe interest from the private sector will help the push for drug-policy changes.\par \par \uc2 Numinus, founded this year, has acquired a clinic in Vancouver and is working with psychiatrists and therapists to design psychedelic treatment protocols as well as software to analyze efficacy.\par \par \uc2 Other companies are staying away from pushing legalization efforts or presenting their offerings as health care. Amsterdam-based Synthesis Retreats and Jamaica-based Atman Retreat, which operate in countries where psilocybin use is legal or decriminalized, run wellness retreats catering to people who haven't been diagnosed with clinical illnesses.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20190904000029"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020190904ef9400007\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The impact of the U.S.-China trade war is widening, with more small businesses in the U.S., manufacturers in Asia and others feeling the effects as a new round of tariffs kicked in. Meanwhile, U.S. consumer spending and inflation picked up in July, but the prospects for continued strong spending ahead are less clear. And \uc2 Australia's central bank\uc2  left rates unchanged.\par \par \uc2 Now on to today's news and analysis.\par \par \uc2 Top News\par \par \uc2 U.S.-China Trade War's Global Impact Grows\par \par \uc2 The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is rippling through the global economy, hurting confidence among U.S. small businesses, crimping trade among industrial giants in Asia and hitting export-oriented factories in Europe. On Sunday the U.S. imposed fresh tariffs of 15% on Chinese goods including clothing, tools and electronics. A round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs also took effect, targeting imports of U.S. soybeans, crude oil and pharmaceuticals. Beijing said on Monday it lodged a complaint with the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  over the Trump administration's tariffs.\par \par \uc2 * Small Businesses' Faith in Economy Hits Low on Tariff Uncertainty\par \par \uc2 * Trump: Companies, Not Trade Policies, to Blame for Business Setbacks\par \par \uc2 * Trade Disputes Curb Global Factory Activity as Confidence Wanes\par \par \uc2 Strength in U.S. Consumer Spending Drives Economy\par \par \uc2 U.S. households {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-spending-rose-sharply-in-july-11567168319?mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ramped up their spending }}}\uc2  in July, providing reassurance that the economy's decadelong expansion continued to roll despite slowing factory activity and global growth. Personal-consumption expenditures, a measure of household spending, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in July from June, a pickup from the previous two months, the Commerce Department said Friday, continuing a solid performance by the economy's main driving force.\par \par \uc2 * Cheap Gas Revs Up Consumers, Boding Well for U.S. Economy\par \par \uc2 * Analysis: The American Consumer Keeps Beating Expectations\par \par \uc2 Inflation Picked Up in July\par \par \uc2 U.S. inflation rebounded in July on the back of strong consumer spending, the latest sign that price pressures are recovering from a slow start to the year that helped motivate the Federal Reserve to ease borrowing costs. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption-expenditures price index, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.21% in July from the prior month and 1.38% from July 2018, the Commerce Department said.\par \par \uc2 Other Developments Around the World\par \par \uc2 Australia's RBA\uc2  Stands Pat But Leaves Door Ajar to Cut Further\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Reserve Bank of Australia\uc2  left its cash rate steady at a record low of 1% at a policy meeting Tuesday, but left the door open to cut interest rates further in coming months if the job market weakens and global shocks threaten growth.\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/glynns-take-australias-economy-very-likely-contracted-in-2nd-quarter-11567411322?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=14&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Australia's Economy Very Likely Contracted in Second Quarter }}}\par \par \uc2 The Market Forces That Propelled a Massive Rally in Long Bonds\par \par \uc2 Long-term bonds have been on a tear in recent weeks with yields tumbling enough to heighten fears of a possible recession ahead.

Faced with a shrinking economy, the finance ministry has been working on proposals worth about \u8364\'20\'AC50 billion ($55 billion) and almost entirely financed by debt, according to two senior officials.\par \par \uc2 Argentina's President Pulls a U-Turn, Imposes Capital Controls\par \par \uc2 Facing financial-market turmoil, Argentina's government on Monday implemented capital controls in an unexpected move that comes more than three years after President Mauricio Macri lifted similar restrictions.\par \par \uc2 * Peso Strengthens Against Dollar After Currency Controls Introduced\par \par \uc2 Historic Asset Boom Passes by Half of American Families\par \par \uc2 The decadelong economic expansion has showered the U.S. with staggering new wealth driven by a booming stock market and rising house prices. But that windfall has passed by many Americans. The bottom half of all U.S. households, as measured by wealth, have only recently regained the wealth lost in the 2007-2009 recession and still have 32% less wealth, adjusted for inflation, than in 2003, according to recent Federal Reserve figures.\par \par \uc2 Financial Regulation Roundup\par \par \uc2 Risky Seller Financing Flourishes Where Homes Are Cheapest\par \par \uc2 Poorer Americans buying inexpensive homes have few options in the conventional mortgage system.

That's not good news, since tumbling unemployment hasn't yet generated solid wage growth, and the sales tax is set to increase to 10% from 8% in just a month's time," writes WSJ's Mike Bird, who calls the Oct. 1 tax rise a needless economic mishap. "The move is all but guaranteed to dent consumption again, and given the country's already-tenuous economic growth, could easily spark another recession. Rock-bottom interest rates mean that Japan's net interest spending is among the lowest of any advanced economy, and fiscal consolidation is unnecessary. With the labor market now looking like it may have reached its peak without generating stronger consumption, fighting the phantom threat of the country's high debt load is a mistake" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shouldn't make again, Mr. Bird says.\par \par \uc2 Basis Points\par \par \uc2 * U.S. household sentiment fell in August from the earlier month amid concerns over a trade war. The \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2  on Friday said its final index of August consumer sentiment was 89.8, a drop of 8.6 points from July and the largest monthly fall since December 2012.\par \par \uc2 * The Canadian economy rebounded in the second quarter as one of the strongest export showings this decade offset a decline in business investment and soft household spending.\par \par \uc2 * India's economic growth slowed to a six-year low last quarter as debt problems at banks choked business and consumer spending in Asia's third largest economy.\par \par \uc2 * South Korea's consumer inflation slowed to a record low last month, pushing the index further below the central bank's 2% target.\par \par \uc2 * The chances of an early British election to resolve the Brexit impasse appeared to rise on Monday as Prime Minister \uc2 Boris Johnson\uc2  launched a broadside at lawmakers seeking to thwart his Brexit plans.\par \par \uc2 * Argentina's presidential front-runner said the government's new plan to restructure its short-term debt shows the country is virtually insolvent, as a crisis of confidence has wiped out private-sector demand for government debt.\par \par \uc2 * The euro fell to a two-year low Friday as some investors bet that lackluster economic data would force the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  to further ease monetary policy next month.\par \par \uc2 * Turkey's economy expanded in the second quarter but remained smaller than it was a year earlier, data released Monday showed, a challenge for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose approval ratings have slumped amid high unemployment and inflation.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20190903ef930002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Evidence from the UK suggests that the upward march has moderated with last year's 13 per cent fall as a cause of celebration.\par \par \uc2 While votes on pay at annual meetings tend to receive more than 90 per cent shareholder approval, dialogue between investors and remuneration committees before the vote will have helped curb excess.\par \par \uc2 Two crucial questions are now being danced around. The first is whether institutional shareholders are really concerned about absolute pay levels and the gap between the top and the average worker. The second is whether a big driver of differences between the two bonus payments is justified.\par \par \uc2 The proof on absolute pay will be whether last year's reduction turns out to be more than a dip related to falls in equity markets. A report from the High Pay Centre, a think-tank that monitors pay in top roles, and \uc2 Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development\uc2 , anHRindustry association, shows that it is too early to pronounce a downward trend. The median pay for FTSE 100 chief executives has been bobbling about in the \u163\'00\'A33.4mto\u163\'00\'A34.2mrange since2010.\par \par \uc2 UK regulations on the pay gap, enacted in 2018, require large listed companies to report the ratio of chief executive pay to the median employee. The gap varied by sector, from 34 times in technology to 177 times in consumer goods last year, according to the report. Boards will have to refer to this ratio from next year in discussingexecutive pay.\par \par \uc2 The information will provide plenty of grist for commentary on fairness. To what extent will fund managers use it to influence board behaviour? Their own ratio will be much nearer the bottom of the range than the top, thanks to relatively flat hierarchies.\par \par \uc2 The less comfortable reason is that they have a lot of highly paid staff, including ones paid more than the chief executive. This jars with the changingworldfor activemanagers.\par \par \uc2 Fees have been driven down by competition from passive funds, lower returns. and transparency. The pressure is on to reduce costs, and staff are the biggest single one.\par \par \uc2 This brings us to the second difficult issue for the sector: bonuses. At \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , chief executive \uc2 Peter Harrison\uc2 's \u163\'00\'A36.17m of variable pay was 11 times his fixed salary \u8212\'20\'14 his bonus attracted a 12 per cent protest vote at the annual meeting.\par \par \uc2 Even at \uc2 Legal & General Investment Management\uc2 , which operates through passive funds and promotes so-called inclusive capitalism, senior managers' variable pay was 250 per cent of their fixed salary, according to disclosures to theFCA.\par \par \uc2 The cap for bankers under rules covering material risk takers is 100 per cent, or twice that with shareholder approval.\par \par \uc2 The cultural attachment to bonuses is rooted in the tradition of active management and the pursuit of alpha. This has the advantage of reducing fixed costs in a bad year. But while pay for performance will always have a place, separating out individual contribution, discounting for risk and choosing a timeframe for measurementremainproblematic.\par \par \uc2 The star culture can be seen as a feature of equity bull markets, where brilliant individuals dig into corporate accounts to gain an edge. In fixed income, with a narrower risk-reward trade-off, investment decisions more clearly involve a team, which draws onmacroandmicrosources.\par \par \uc2 Count in the growing cohort of technology experts, analysing data from satellites and \b \highlight22\uc2 natural language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and teamwork becomes vital for all asset classes. Are there any individual stars in the ETF market among those who devise screens to capture clients' values or who perfect tradingautomation? Another change has been the setting of non-financial goals for managers, such as executing group strategy and nurturing talent. But these are part of the job covered by base salary. The approach could be extended along the investment decision-making chain, recognising the broader dutiesof serving clients.\par \par \uc2 A final reason for the sector to rely less on variable pay is its sheer complexity. Bonuses are deferred and partly paid in shares or fund units whose value varies. They are subject to potential penalties and the discretion of remuneration committees . Valuing uncertain rewards is hard, and may even lead an individual to ask formore tocompensate.\par \par \uc2 The time has come for the sector to reviewitspayideology,makingsalary the most important element of the totalandflexing those totalsdown.\par \par \uc2 Jane Fuller is a fellow of CFA Society of the UK and co-director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation\par \par \uc2 Fees have been driven down thepressureis on to reduce costs, and staff are the biggest one\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020190902ef9200066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The buying and selling price for shares of an OEIC and units of a single priced unit trust are the same. Exit Charges: The letter E denotes that an exit charge may be made when you sell units, contact the manager/operator for full details.

Funds mainly made up of equities normally quote a yield representing the estimated annual payout net of tax for basic rate taxpayer. For further information contact the management company.\par \par \uc2 Historic pricing: The letter H denotes that the managers/operators will normally deal on the price set at the most recent valuation. The prices shown are the latest available before publication and may not be the current dealing levels because of an intervening portfolio revaluation or a switch to a forward pricing basis.

The CEO of a U.K. company, fooled by an AI-enabled impersonation of the voice of his boss, wired money to a bank account, letting scammers get away with about $243,000, WSJ Pro's Catherine Stupp reports. The incident early this year shows that hackers are picking up basic \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technologies for cyberattack. Traditional cybersecurity tools weren't built to detect AI-enabled voice impersonation, experts say.\par \par \uc2 Also today: U.S. prosecutors look into more instances of alleged tech theft by Huawei; \uc2 General Electric\uc2  to build new tech for Pentagon to protect military information and other data; Mount Sinai patients get notice their personal information was exposed.\par \par \uc2 Note: We're taking a break Monday for Labor Day in the U.S. Cyber Daily will be back on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Fraudsters Use AI to Mimic CEO's Voice in Cybercrime Case\par \par \uc2 Scams using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  are a new challenge for companies\par \par \uc2 By Catherine Stupp\par \par \uc2 Criminals used \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -based software to impersonate a chief executive's voice and demand a fraudulent transfer of \u8364\'20\'AC220,000 ($243,000) in March in what cybercrime experts described as an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy&mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 unusual case of \\b artificial intelligence\\b0  being used in hacking }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The chief executive of a U.K.-based energy firm thought he was speaking on the phone with his boss, the CEO of the firm's German parent company, who asked him to send the funds to a Hungarian supplier. The caller said the request was urgent, directing the executive to pay within an hour, according to the company's insurance firm, \uc2 Euler Hermes Group SA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Euler Hermes\uc2  declined to name the victim companies.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement authorities and AI experts have predicted that criminals would use AI to automate cyberattacks. Whoever was behind this incident appears to have used AI-based software to successfully mimic the German executive's voice by phone. The U.K. CEO recognized his boss's slight German accent and the tenor of his voice on the phone, said R\u252\'00\'FCdiger Kirsch, a fraud expert at \uc2 Euler Hermes\uc2 , a subsidiary of Munich-based financial services company \uc2 Allianz SE\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Several officials said the voice-spoofing attack in Europe is the first cybercrime they have heard of in which criminals clearly drew on AI. \uc2 Euler Hermes\uc2 , which covered the entire amount of the victim company's claim, hasn't dealt with other claims seeking to recover losses from crimes involving AI, according to Mr. Kirsch.\par \par \uc2 Scams using AI are a new challenge for companies, Mr. Kirsch said. Traditional cybersecurity tools designed to keep hackers off corporate networks can't spot spoofed voices. Cybersecurity companies have recently developed products to detect so-called deepfake recordings.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether this is the first attack using AI or whether there are other incidents that have gone unreported or in which authorities did not detect the technology in use, said Philipp Amann, head of strategy at Europol's European Cybercrime Center. \uc2 Europol\uc2  is the European police agency. While it is hard to predict whether there might soon be an uptick in cyberattacks using AI, Mr. Amann said hackers are more likely to use the technology if it makes attacks more successful or profitable.\par \par \uc2 Multistage attack\par \par \uc2 The attackers responsible for defrauding the British energy company called three times, Mr. Kirsch said. After the transfer of the $243,000 went through, the hackers called to say the parent company had transferred money to reimburse the U.K. firm. They then made a third call later that day, again impersonating the CEO, and asked for a second payment. Because the transfer reimbursing the funds hadn't yet arrived and the third call was from an Austrian phone number, the executive became suspicious. He didn't make the second payment.\par \par \uc2 The money that was transferred to the Hungarian bank account was subsequently moved to Mexico and distributed to other locations. Investigators haven't identified any suspects, Mr. Kirsch said.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether the attackers used bots to react to the victim's questions. If they did, it might have been even more difficult for law enforcement authorities to investigate, Mr. Amann said. A police investigation into the case has ended, Mr. Kirsch said. \uc2 Europol\uc2  wasn't involved.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kirsch believes hackers used commercial voice-generating software to carry out the attack. He recorded his own voice using one such product and said the reproduced version sounded real.\par \par \uc2 A few software companies offer services that can quickly impersonate voices, said Bobby Filar, director of data science at Endgame, a cybersecurity company. "You don't need to be a Ph.D. in mathematics to use it." he said.\par \par \uc2 Another tactic hackers could use would be to stitch together audio samples to mimic a person's voice, which would likely require many hours of recordings. Security researchers demonstrated this technique at the Black Hat conference last year.\par \par \uc2 Attackers could use publicly available voice recordings to impersonate celebrities or executives.\par \par \uc2 "You can't go around and be silent the entire time. You're going to run into situations like this where you expose information that you never thought could be used against you," Mr. Filar said.\par \par \uc2 Applying \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology to spoof voices makes cybercrime easier, said Irakli Beridze, head of the Centre on AI and Robotics at the \uc2 United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The UN center is researching technologies to detect fake videos, which Mr. Beridze said could be an even more useful tool for hackers. In the case at the U.K. energy firm, an unfamiliar phone number finally aroused suspicions. "Imagine a video call with [a CEO's] voice, the facial expressions you're familiar with. Then you wouldn't have any doubts at all," he said.\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 $5 Trillion\par \par \uc2 Estimated annual world-wide cost of data breaches by 2024, up from $3 trillion today, according to Juniper Research Ltd. Increasing regulatory fines and lost business account for the majority of the tally.\par \par \uc2 More Cyber News\par \par \uc2 U.S. prosecutors probe Huawei on new allegations of technology theft. U.S. prosecutors are looking into additional instances of alleged technology theft by \uc2 Huawei Technologies Co\uc2 ., The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter, potentially expanding beyond existing criminal cases against the Chinese telecommunications giant. Among the situations being examined are episodes in which Huawei was accused of stealing intellectual property from multiple people and companies over several years, as well as how the company went about recruiting employees from competitors, these people said.\par \par \uc2 IP theft allegations: The new inquiries overlap with findings from a Wall Street Journal investigation in May that documented numerous allegations of intellectual property theft against Huawei throughout its history, these people said. They include alleged theft of smartphone-camera technology from a Portuguese multimedia producer and Huawei's practices of recruiting employees from rival companies, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Huawei said: At the time, Huawei said it is committed to complying with laws in global markets and has a track record of innovation. "We respect the integrity of intellectual property rights\u8212\'20\'14for our own business, as well as peer, partner and competitor companies," the company said. It couldn't be determined if new charges are being sought against the company. A Huawei spokesman declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 GE to help Pentagon protect data moving between classified, unclassified networks. The Pentagon's \uc2 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\uc2 , or Darpa, gave \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 . a contract for $8.6 million to build technology to isolate various parts of government networks, NextGov reports. The flow of some military information and other sensitive data now is controlled with air gaps, or breaks between systems or networks. GE, along with Galois Inc. and \uc2 Northrop Grumman Corp\uc2 ., will work on Darpa projects to improve air gap techniques and to build new technology to better secure data.\par \par \uc2 Mount Sinai notifies patients of data breach. A cyberattack at American Medical Collection Agency resulted in the exposure of sensitive data about more than 33,000 patients of Mount Sinai, Becker's Hospital Review reports. At least one unit of the New York-based hospital group used American Medical for billing services. \uc2 Laboratory Corp. of America\uc2 , \uc2 Quest Diagnostics Inc\uc2 . and other health-care firms have also been affected by the incident at American Medical.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20190830ef8u0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The caller said the request was urgent, directing the executive to pay within an hour, according to the company's insurance firm, \uc2 Euler Hermes Group SA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Euler Hermes\uc2  declined to name the victim companies.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement authorities and AI experts {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-could-make-cyberattacks-more-dangerous-harder-to-detect-1542128667"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 have predicted that criminals would use }}}\uc2  AI to automate cyberattacks. Whoever was behind this incident appears to have used AI-based software to successfully mimic the German executive's voice by phone. The U.K. CEO recognized his boss' slight German accent and the melody of his voice on the phone, said R\u252\'00\'FCdiger Kirsch, a fraud expert at \uc2 Euler Hermes\uc2 , a subsidiary of Munich-based financial services company \uc2 Allianz SE\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Several officials said the voice-spoofing attack in Europe is the first cybercrime they have heard of in which criminals clearly drew on AI. \uc2 Euler Hermes\uc2 , which covered the entire amount of the victim company's claim, hasn't dealt with other claims seeking to recover losses from crimes involving AI, according to Mr. Kirsch.\par \par \uc2 Scams using AI are a new challenge for companies, Mr. Kirsch said. Traditional cybersecurity tools designed to keep hackers off corporate networks can't spot spoofed voices. Cybersecurity companies have recently developed products to detect so-called deepfake recordings.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether this is the first attack using AI or whether there are other incidents that have gone unreported or in which authorities didn't detect the technology in use, said Philipp Amann, head of strategy at Europol's European Cybercrime Center. \uc2 Europol\uc2  is the European police agency. While it is hard to predict whether there might soon be an uptick in cyberattacks using AI, Mr. Amann said hackers are more likely to use the technology if it makes attacks more successful or profitable.\par \par \uc2 The attackers responsible for defrauding the British energy company called three times, Mr. Kirsch said. After the transfer of the $243,000 went through, the hackers called to say the parent company had transferred money to reimburse the U.K. firm. They then made a third call later that day, again impersonating the CEO, and asked for a second payment. Because the transfer reimbursing the funds hadn't yet arrived and the third call was from an Austrian phone number, the executive became suspicious. He didn't make the second payment.\par \par \uc2 The money that was transferred to the Hungarian bank account was subsequently moved to Mexico and distributed to other locations. Investigators haven't identified any suspects, Mr. Kirsch said.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether the attackers used bots to react to the victim's questions. If they did, it might have been even more difficult for law enforcement authorities to investigate, Mr. Amann said. A police investigation into the case has ended, Mr. Kirsch said. \uc2 Europol\uc2  wasn't involved.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kirsch believes hackers used commercial voice-generating software to carry out the attack. He recorded his own voice using one such product and said the reproduced version sounded real.\par \par \uc2 A few software companies offer services that can quickly impersonate voices, said Bobby Filar, director of data science at Endgame, a cybersecurity company. "You don't need to be a Ph.D. in mathematics to use it." he said.\par \par \uc2 Another tactic hackers could use would be to stitch together audio samples to mimic a person's voice, which would likely require many hours of recordings. Security researchers demonstrated this technique at the Black Hat conference last year.\par \par \uc2 Attackers could use publicly available voice recordings to impersonate celebrities or executives.\par \par \uc2 "You can't go around and be silent the entire time. You're going to run into situations like this where you expose information that you never thought could be used against you," Mr. Filar said.\par \par \uc2 Applying \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology to spoof voices makes cybercrime easier, said Irakli Beridze, head of the Centre on AI and Robotics at the \uc2 United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The U.N. center is researching technologies to detect fake videos, which Mr. Beridze said could be an even more useful tool for hackers. In the case at the U.K. energy firm, an unfamiliar phone number finally aroused suspicions. "Imagine a video call with [a CEO's] voice, the facial expressions you're familiar with. Then you wouldn't have any doubts at all," he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Catherine Stupp at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20190830ef8u00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Using \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to help make venture-capital investment decisions is an attractive idea, since many investors' own companies often use the technology.\par \par \uc2 But \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  doesn't actually work well for venture investing, according to Alessio Fanelli of 645 Ventures, because the information you need to perform such analysis, like revenue numbers, is hard to get hold of. In addition, \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  relies on analyzing past patterns, and venture investing typically requires looking to massive changes or completely new platforms that aren't accounted for in past data.\par \par \uc2 New York-based 645 does rely on technology when scouting investments, but generally for simpler tasks, such as finding all the companies in a particular sector, Mr. Fanelli wrote. Several venture firms, including \uc2 Correlation Ventures\uc2 , Rocketship.vc and SignalFire, say they use \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other related technologies to find and identify promising companies.\par \par \uc2 Note: The WSJ Pro VC newsletter won't be sent on Monday in observance of the U.S. Labor Day holiday. We'll be back on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Muscular funding. Biotechnology venture capitalists recently have sold a trio of companies with potential treatments for muscle diseases, a sector where startups historically haven't attracted much funding, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-investors-score-with-muscle-disease-treatments-11567110479?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * This week, Modis Therapeutics Inc. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-investors-set-to-make-quick-returns-in-modis-therapeutics-sale-11566855736?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 agreed to be acquired }}}\uc2  by \uc2 Zogenix Inc\uc2 . in a deal worth up to $400 million. \uc2 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc\uc2 . purchased Exonics Therapeutics Inc. in June for up to $1 billion, and \uc2 Sarepta Therapeutics Inc\uc2 . exercised an option to buy Myonexus Therapeutics Inc. in February, paying $165 million.\par \par \uc2 * Muscle diseases draw less attention than say heart disease or neurological disorders, but venture funding in the category has jumped recently, rising to a record $512.1 million in 2018 from $266 million the previous year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.\par \par \uc2 * One reason: Venture firms and drug companies are investing heavily in treatments for rare genetic diseases. Several genetic diseases affect the muscles, and have limited treatment options.\par \par \uc2 Juul investigation. The \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  is investigating the marketing practices of e-cigarette startup \uc2 Juul Labs Inc\uc2 ., the Journal's Jennifer Maloney reported, citing people familiar with the matter. FTC investigators are looking at whether Juul engaged in deceptive marketing, including by targeting minors or using influencers, some of the people said. Juul is minority-owned by \uc2 Altria\uc2 , the maker of Marlboro cigarettes. Tiger Global and venture-capital firm Tao Capital also hold stakes in the company.\par \par \uc2 California gig-worker law. Lyft and Uber offered a set of proposals to California lawmakers that they described as a compromise: a minimum wage of $21 an hour for time spent driving and picking up customers, a fund to pay for benefits such as paid sick leave, and the ability for workers to organize a group that could negotiate with numerous employers of drivers all together, rather than individually. They said if Assembly Bill 5, that would classify drivers for those and other similar companies as employees, becomes law and no other legislation addressing their concerns passes, the companies would put their resources behind a measure on next year's ballot featuring the proposals they are backing.\par \par \uc2 Latin America fund. \uc2 Kaszek Ventures\uc2  has raised $600 million for technology investments in Latin America. The firm closed on $375 million for early-stage fund Kaszek Ventures IV and $225 million for a later-stage vehicle, Kaszek Ventures Opportunity I. Both funds were oversubscribed, the firm said. Kaszek had sought to raise $500 million for the funds as one of several firms targeting Latin American startups, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/latin-american-venture-firms-angle-for-slice-of-global-funding-boom-11562954831?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro Venture Capital earlier reported }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 The first female space tourist on what we can do in orbit.

Three U.S. senators wrote a letter to Amazon.com Inc. CEO \uc2 Jeff Bezos\uc2  asking him to take action to stop the sale of unsafe items and to ensure accurate warning labels on his company's giant sales platform.\par \par \uc2 Alphabet dips its toe into infrastructure investing. The white-hot world of infrastructure investing has attracted a notable new entrant: \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . The technology giant is teaming up with its subsidiary, Sidewalk Labs LLC, and \uc2 Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan\uc2  to launch Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners.\par \par \uc2 Dating apps are making marriages stronger.

"But this is where our money goes."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bookman added that governments choose to make more of this information public when using \uc2 OpenGov\uc2  because it is displayed in digestible user-friendly ways.\par \par \uc2 An example of a metric \uc2 OpenGov\uc2  could show is overtime spending by the local police department during summer months.\par \par \uc2 OpenGov\uc2  customers include the Idaho State Controller's Office and the Illinois State Treasurer.\par \par \uc2 In August, the state of West Virginia began using \uc2 OpenGov\uc2  software to streamline financial reporting between the state and its municipalities.\par \par \uc2 Another startup, ClearGov, Inc., offers similar software and has raised roughly $5 million from investors including \uc2 Kepha Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In an email, ClearGov CEO Chris Bullock said the company's software can turn complex financial data into easy-to-understand infographics that residents can use to see how their tax dollars are being put to use and compare their own communities with others.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, numerous venture- and private equity-funded startups are targeting corporations, nonprofits and the education sector with similar software platforms focused on budgeting and financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \uc2 Centage Corp\uc2 ., for example, has raised roughly $24 million from investors including TVC Capital, according to CEO \uc2 John Murdock\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 OpenGov\uc2  will use the new capital to expand its product line and for research and development.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bookman said the majority of \uc2 OpenGov\uc2 's existing investors also participated in the fundraising.\par \par \uc2 Thrive Capital\u8212\'20\'14a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-that-got-a-seat-at-white-house-roundtable-is-part-owned-by-kushner-family-1500045800"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 previous investor }}}\uc2  and venture firm run by Josh Kushner, whose brother Jared is an adviser and son-in-law to President Trump\u8212\'20\'14didn't participate in the Series D round, Mr. Bookman said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bookman said \uc2 OpenGov\uc2  only works with state and local governments and has no intention of expanding to the federal government.\par \par \uc2 OpenGov\uc2  has raised $140 million since it was founded in 2012.

A subscription costs $39 a month in the US or \u163\'00\'A339 in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Frederic Court, founder of \uc2 Felix Capital\uc2 , which invested in Peloton when it first expanded out of the US in 2018, said that he had \u8220\'20\'1Cnever seen a company with so much customer love\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is so much enthusiasm from the user around the product. That is quite rare to see such a commitment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Peloton\u8217\'20\'19s growth has boomed, along with the wider fitness market. In September 2015, one year after it released its first bike, the company had attracted about 11,000 monthly subscribers.\par \par \uc2 Today, it counts 511,202, plus a further 102,000 subscribers to its digital boot camp, yoga and running classes who do not own a Peloton bike or treadmill, according to its prospectus. The group says it has so far only tapped a fraction of its addressable market, which it pegs at 67m households.\par \par \uc2 According to a 2018 report from the \uc2 International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association\uc2 , 183m people have gym memberships worldwide. Peloton is optimistic that a significant share of those members will swap their gym cards for a home bike or treadmill.\par \par \uc2 But its prospectus shows how expensive its marketing campaign has been, and while revenues more than doubled in the year to June 30 \u8212\'20\'14 rising to $915m from $435m the year before \u8212\'20\'14 its losses rose nearly-four fold to $196m.\par \par \uc2 The listing also comes at a time when consumers are being flooded with fitness and wellness apps, hacks and memberships. Investors are wary that too much capital has flowed into the industry, allowing companies to pursue growth over profits. According to the most recent report from the Global Wellness Institute, the fitness and meditation industry was worth $595bn in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Peloton sees its main rivals as high end gyms and the likes of \uc2 SoulCycle\uc2  and Flywheel, which have both found cult-like followings for their high intensity cycling classes. It now has 2.4 times as many riders as \uc2 SoulCycle\uc2 , which pulled its own plans for an IPO, according to data from the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company Second Measure.\par \par \uc2 SoulCycle\uc2  and its high-end gym operator owner, Equinox, were also recently hit by calls for a boycott because they are owned by Stephen Ross, the Donald Trump supporting property developer.\par \par \uc2 Peloton itself is locked in litigation after it used music in some of its beat-heavy fitness videos that music publishers allege were not properly licensed. When the company removed some of those classes from its catalogue, it encountered backlash from its riders.\par \par \uc2 It faces other companies encroaching on the fitness at home market. Mirror, for example, offers fitness classes beamed out of a mirror-like screen on your wall. It reached a $300m valuation in June. Zwift also offers a virtual cycling experience.\par \par \uc2 Paul Davies, head of leisure research at Mintel, has also warned that users outside of the US do not appear as keen on the company and roughly 98 per cent of Peloton\u8217\'20\'19s equipment sales have been in America.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAwareness of Peloton is actually very, very low in the UK. There are a lot of people out there who probably aren\u8217\'20\'19t aware that you can pay for streamed workouts at home. I think part of this investment will be about boosting the brand,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 John Foley\uc2 , Peloton\u8217\'20\'19s founder who told the FT in a 2015 interview that it was \u8220\'20\'1Cbone crushingly hard\u8221\'20\'1D to raise money ahead of its launch in 2014, wrote in the prospectus that Peloton \u8220\'20\'1Csells happiness\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 But as the company identified in the risks to the business outlined in the S-1 filing, it will join a role call of lossmaking tech companies, including Uber, Lyft and \uc2 Pinterest\uc2  which could put investors off.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future,\u8221\'20\'1D it said.\par \par \uc2 But one source close to the company said that he did not think they would find it hard to attract investment. \u8220\'20\'1CTo date they haven\u8217\'20\'19t struggled for investors,\u8221\'20\'1D they said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020190828ef8s006hd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

A subscription costs $39 a month in the US or \u163\'00\'A339 in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Frederic Court, founder of \uc2 Felix Capital\uc2 , which invested in Peloton when it first expanded out of the US in 2018, said that he had \u8220\'20\'1Cnever seen a company with so much customer love\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is so much enthusiasm from the user around the product. That is quite rare to see such a commitment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Peloton\u8217\'20\'19s growth has boomed, along with the wider fitness market. In September 2015, one year after it released its first bike, the company had attracted about 11,000 monthly subscribers.\par \par \uc2 Today, it counts 511,202, plus a further 102,000 subscribers to its digital boot camp, yoga and running classes who do not own a Peloton bike or treadmill, according to its prospectus. The group says it has so far only tapped a fraction of its addressable market, which it pegs at 67m households.\par \par \uc2 According to a 2018 report from the \uc2 International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association\uc2 , 183m people have gym memberships worldwide. Peloton is optimistic that a significant share of those members will swap their gym cards for a home bike or treadmill.\par \par \uc2 But its prospectus shows how expensive its marketing campaign has been, and while revenues more than doubled in the year to June 30 \u8212\'20\'14 rising to $915m from $435m the year before \u8212\'20\'14 its losses rose nearly-four fold to $196m.\par \par \uc2 The listing also comes at a time when consumers are being flooded with fitness and wellness apps, hacks and memberships. Investors are wary that too much capital has flowed into the industry, allowing companies to pursue growth over profits. According to the most recent report from the Global Wellness Institute, the fitness and meditation industry was worth $595bn in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Peloton sees its main rivals as high end gyms and the likes of \uc2 SoulCycle\uc2  and Flywheel, which have both found cult-like followings for their high intensity cycling classes. It now has 2.4 times as many riders as \uc2 SoulCycle\uc2 , which pulled its own plans for an IPO, according to data from the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company Second Measure.\par \par \uc2 SoulCycle\uc2  and its high-end gym operator owner, Equinox, were also recently hit by calls for a boycott because they are owned by Stephen Ross, the Donald Trump supporting property developer.\par \par \uc2 Peloton itself is locked in litigation after it used music in some of its beat-heavy fitness videos that music publishers allege were not properly licensed. When the company removed some of those classes from its catalogue, it encountered backlash from its riders.\par \par \uc2 It faces other companies encroaching on the fitness at home market. Mirror, for example, offers fitness classes beamed out of a mirror-like screen on your wall. It reached a $300m valuation in June. Zwift also offers a virtual cycling experience.\par \par \uc2 Paul Davies, head of leisure research at Mintel, has also warned that users outside of the US do not appear as keen on the company and roughly 98 per cent of Peloton\u8217\'20\'19s equipment sales have been in America.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAwareness of Peloton is actually very, very low in the UK. There are a lot of people out there who probably aren\u8217\'20\'19t aware that you can pay for streamed workouts at home. I think part of this investment will be about boosting the brand,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 John Foley\uc2 , Peloton\u8217\'20\'19s founder who told the FT in a 2015 interview that it was \u8220\'20\'1Cbone crushingly hard\u8221\'20\'1D to raise money ahead of its launch in 2014, wrote in the prospectus that Peloton \u8220\'20\'1Csells happiness\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 But as the company identified in the risks to the business outlined in the S-1 filing, it will join a role call of lossmaking tech companies, including Uber, Lyft and \uc2 Pinterest\uc2  which could put investors off.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future,\u8221\'20\'1D it said.\par \par \uc2 But one source close to the company said that he did not think they would find it hard to attract investment. \u8220\'20\'1CTo date they haven\u8217\'20\'19t struggled for investors,\u8221\'20\'1D they said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020190828ef8s006hd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  is increasingly questioning public companies about compliance with U.S. sanctions as the nation's blacklist of individuals and entities grows.\par \par \uc2 The regulator has slowly ramped up comment letters to companies seeking more details about disclosures related to dealings in countries targeted by U.S. sanctions, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of regulatory filings and data compiled by consulting firm Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc.\par \par \uc2 At least 42 companies received letters from the SEC last year regarding activity in areas subject to sanctions enforced by the \uc2 Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control\uc2 . That matches the 2017 total, which is up from an average of about 33 during the three years ending in 2016, according to Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In recent months, the SEC has sent letters to companies such as \uc2 PayPal Holdings Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon Corp\uc2 . and Chinese travel-services provider \uc2 Ctrip.com International Ltd\uc2 . with sanctions-related questions.\par \par \uc2 The SEC doesn't play an active role in penalizing companies for potential sanctions violations, but it does police companies' disclosures to ensure adequate reporting on business risks, said Scott Flicker, a partner at law firm \uc2 Paul Hastings LLP\uc2  in Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 "Companies make disclosures when they deem that information would be material for investment decisions, by current or potential investors," Mr. Flicker said. "Financial materiality is an important touchstone for disclosure, but it's not the only one."\par \par \uc2 The SEC regularly sends comment letters to companies with questions about disclosures made in securities filings. The letters usually focus on accounting practices, and can result in additional disclosures in future filings, revisions to previously filed disclosures, or a simple response with extra details that help the SEC better understand a disclosure. The back-and-forth between a company and the SEC stops once the regulator deems the matter resolved. The letters are typically made public about 20 days after a matter is resolved.\par \par \uc2 Sanctions-related letters comprise just a fraction of the SEC's comment letters, but the proportion of companies receiving them grew from 1.5% in 2014 to 4.5% in 2018, according to Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "They're interested in any possible violation of trade restrictions," said Don Whalen, the firm's director of research. "They probably want to make sure sanctions being placed on the countries are actually being honored."\par \par \uc2 The uptick coincides with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sanctions-compliance-fines-hit-decade-high-11564057920"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a surge in U.S. sanctions}}}\uc2 , which have been used by the Trump administration to increase pressure on geopolitical issues or target suspected criminal behavior.\par \par \uc2 In 2018, almost 1,500 individuals or entities were added to the designation list, according to data compiled by Adam M. Smith, a partner at law firm \uc2 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP\uc2 . That is more than twice the annual average over the previous 10 years.\par \par \uc2 BNY Mellon declined to comment on its SEC correspondence. Ctrip.com didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 PayPal\uc2 , the San Jose, Calif.-based financial technology company, received a comment letter in July about its 2018 annual report, in which \uc2 PayPal\uc2  disclosed that it self-reported to OFAC suspicious transactions that might have violated U.S. sanctions.\par \par \uc2 The SEC asked \uc2 PayPal\uc2  to detail the countries related to the transactions and the extent of the company's contact with the countries. The regulator also asked \uc2 PayPal\uc2  to specify whether those contacts posed a material risk to investors. The correspondence was made public last week.\par \par \uc2 The SEC declined to comment beyond the letters.\par \par \uc2 Related Links\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sanctions-compliance-fines-hit-decade-high-11564057920"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. Sanctions Compliance Fines Hit Decade High}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-sets-expectations-for-sanctions-compliance-programs-11556833373"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Treasury Sets Expectations for Sanctions Compliance Programs}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/evolving-venezuela-sanctions-pose-problems-for-banks-11551143320"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Evolving Venezuela Sanctions Pose Problems for Banks}}}\par \par \uc2 The SEC said in its letters to \uc2 PayPal\uc2  that many investors, particularly institutional investors, have proposed divestments from companies that do business with U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism, and that \uc2 PayPal\uc2  should address the potential impact on the investor sentiment, including reputational harm.\par \par \uc2 Aaron Anderson, \uc2 PayPal\uc2 's chief accounting officer, responded to the SEC, writing that the transactions in question, which occurred between 2013 and 2016, were related to North Korea, Iran, Sudan and Syria\u8212\'20\'14countries that were under U.S. sanctions at the time of processing. He said in the letter that the revenue from the transactions and their volume were negligible to the company and that OFAC hasn't made a decision about whether it would treat the flagged transactions as potential violations, according to the response sent to the SEC by the company.\par \par \uc2 A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the department doesn't speculate on possible sanctions violations or comment on possible or pending investigations.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 PayPal\uc2  makes every effort to comply with laws and regulations in the markets where we do business around the world," a company spokesman said in an email for this article. "As exhibited by the company's track record of self-reporting and work to satisfy clarifying questions posed by the SEC, \uc2 PayPal\uc2  takes its regulatory and compliance obligations seriously."\par \par \uc2 The regulator and the company had a similar exchange in 2016 related to disclosures in \uc2 PayPal\uc2 's 2015 annual report, in which the company said it {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/paypal-to-pay-7-7-million-to-u-s-over-alleged-sanctions-violations-1427312161"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 paid $7.7 million}}}\uc2  to OFAC in March 2015 to settle allegations that it processed transactions worth about $44,000 between 2009 and 2013 and had continued to cooperate with OFAC on additional self-reported transactions.\par \par \uc2 The SEC is looking closely at potential security risks, particularly those related to money-transfer and peer-to-peer payment businesses, said Moshe Katri, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. who follows \uc2 PayPal\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "These are risks that come when you're processing billions of transactions," Mr. Katri said. "This is going to be a consistent pain point for all of these companies."\par \par \uc2 Write to Mengqi Sun at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:mengqi.sun@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mengqi.sun@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Mark Maurer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:mark.maurer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mark.maurer@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020190828ef8s005xx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It also has developed software that banks can use to manage and more easily access the data of their fintech clients.\par \par \uc2 It is rare for Canaan's technology-investment practice to incubate startups, according to Michael Gilroy, a partner at the firm who came up with the idea for Bond.\par \par \uc2 "For this stage it's absolutely a massive swing for us," Mr. Gilroy said.\par \par \uc2 Hedge-fund manager Coatue Management also invested in Bond, Mr. Gilroy said. Canaan had planned to write the full check but made room in the round for Coatue, he said. Coatue has been investing in late-stage private companies for years and recently set up a $700 million early-stage practice, The Information reported.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gilroy recruited Roy Ng, previously president and chief operating officer of Mapbox Inc. and COO of Twilio Inc., as Bond's chief executive and co-founder. Bond's other co-founders are Matt Bradley, formerly vice president of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  at Synapse Financial Technologies Inc., and Yan Wu, who was head of data at \uc2 Social Finance Inc\uc2 ., or SoFi.\par \par \uc2 Regulated regional banks in the U.S. have served as the backbone for many new fintech products, beginning with the wave of online lending a decade ago. But such partnerships have been cumbersome, Mr. Gilroy said.\par \par \uc2 In order for a startup to start offering deposit accounts, debit cards, loans and other financial products, it must work with a regulated bank.\par \par \uc2 For example, Bancorp \uc2 Bank of Wilmington\uc2 , Del., issues debit cards on behalf of mobile banking startup Chime, while Utah-based \uc2 Celtic Bank\uc2  issues loans for online lender \uc2 Kabbage Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Companies would use Bond's platform to send data about their fintech products and customers to partner banks. Banks would use Bond and the data it collects to qualify and sign up new fintech clients and to manage these relationships. Banks also could use Bond to pull information about its fintech clients for regulatory audits. Fintech companies, meanwhile, could use Bond to compare partner banks.\par \par \uc2 The need for better integration with banks is growing as companies in more industries, from ride-hailing to e-commerce and business software, seek to offer financial products or expand their suite of fintech services, Mr. Gilroy said.\par \par \uc2 Bond's services would compete to some degree with other venture-backed companies such as Cross River Bank, an FDIC-insured bank that focuses on working with fintech companies, and Synapse, which helps fintech companies launch various banking products.\par \par \uc2 Current solutions are lacking, Mr. Gilroy said, as another Canaan portfolio company found out. Accounting software startup ScaleFactor Inc., for example, has been trying to start lending to its customers, Mr. Gilroy said, because the company believes it can offer better loans based on the information it has about its customers. It has been working on a bank integration with Salt Lake City-based \uc2 Celtic Bank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We went out and started engaging these banks 18 months ago, and we still don't have a product in the market yet," Mr. Gilroy said of ScaleFactor.\par \par \uc2 Bond is operating out of Canaan's San Francisco offices but is looking to move out shortly, Mr. Ng said. The company expects to have between 25 and 35 employees by the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ng said he hopes to have several banks on Bond's platform within a year. "I want to build a brand out there that not only banks and fintechs trust but also the regulators," he said.\par \par \uc2 Benjamin Lawsky, a former financial services superintendent for New York, is an adviser to Bond and has equity in the startup, Mr. Gilroy said.\par \par \uc2 The seed deal was the culmination of a long process, Mr. Gilroy said. "It's a lot more work than having a team come in and pitch you," Mr. Gilroy said about incubating a startup. On the upside, the firm holds a bigger stake in Bond than it would receive in a typical seed deal, he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Yuliya Chernova at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:yuliya.chernova@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 yuliya.chernova@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20190827ef8r00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc76}{\*\bkmkend toc76}{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw16\pich17\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal240\pichgoal255

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Financial-services companies are embracing \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which \uc2 International Data Corp\uc2 . has called a game-changer for the industry.\par \par \uc2 However, finance executives face challenges in deploying the technology, including potential government regulation, being able to explain how the technology makes a decision, and gaining an AI edge against competitors.\par \par \uc2 Financial-services executives, data scientists, vendors and others gathered in Midtown Manhattan this week for the Ai4 Finance conference to hear about the latest use cases and lessons from firms that have implemented AI systems.\par \par \uc2 Among the key takeaways:\par \par \uc2 Watch for coming regulations. Wendy Callaghan, chief innovation legal officer and associate general counsel at American International Group Inc., said regulatory proposals and guidelines are emerging around AI that companies need to watch carefully. One piece of proposed legislation, the Algorithmic Accountability Act, calls for companies to conduct "impact assessments of highly sensitive automated decision systems." Ms. Callaghan said it's important for companies that might be affected by the law "start having the conversations around the internal governance that they'll need to provide explanations to regulators...that will then pave the way to be prepared for formal impact assessments, if that comes into play." She said another issue regulators are looking at is "human centricity," or keeping humans involved in some aspect of AI decision-making.\par \par \uc2 Deploy explainability tools. Chris Kovel, \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's head of wealth management \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , intelligence and data technology, talked about the need for financial firms to be able to understand the factors driving algorithmic decisions, known as explainability. He said the company is using an open-source analysis tool called LIME to explain the recommendations made by an AI system dubbed Next Best Action, which guides its financial advisers on client engagement. Mr. Kovel said he's watching other explainability tools in the market. "[We've] got our eye on future models that we believe will have much more explainability." He also said he disagrees with the notion that AI will never be fully explainable. "Those aren't good answers for regulators. Those aren't good answers for our [financial advisers]. Those aren't good answers for our clients," he said.\par \par \uc2 Keep innovating. Richard Mathieson, a managing director at BlackRock Inc., which manages $6.84 trillion in total assets, said the company's quantitative trading unit gathers reams of data and analyzes them with \b \highlight22\uc2 natural language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to make investment decisions. He said the unit has learned a number of lessons since hiring its first data scientist roughly a decade ago. One is that innovation must be ongoing, and companies shouldn't rest on their laurels. "We place a huge amount of emphasis on research and innovation at the very, very heart of our investment process," he said. Still, no matter how much a company relies on technology, human expertise remains key, he added. \b \highlight22\uc2 Big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  are tools that can help answer investment questions, but human expertise and asking the right questions remains critical to developing new investment tools and assessing the results they produce.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jared Council at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jared.council@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jared.council@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROAI20190823ef8n00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Another backer said it was\u160\'00\'A0worried about publicly supporting Libra for fear of attracting the attention of agencies who oversee its\u160\'00\'A0own businesses. Lex says the 27 founders who plan to join\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Facebook\uc2  on Libra are right to have qualms.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, we reported Libra was\u160\'00\'A0under early scrutiny from the \uc2 EU\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s antitrust regulators, according to two people familiar with the matter. The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  has sent out questionnaires to groups involved with\u160\'00\'A0Libra as part of a preliminary information-gathering operation, amid concerns the currency could unfairly disadvantage rivals. Meanwhile, the chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission told us \uc2 Facebook\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s effort to integrate \uc2 Instagram\uc2  and WhatsApp more closely could stymie any attempt to break up the social media giant. Joseph Simons said all options were still on the table as the agency investigates \uc2 Facebook\uc2  for potential antitrust violations.\par \par \uc2 Separately, Richard Waters' Inside Business column argues this week that \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's planned Oversight Board, which would rule on whether \uc2 Facebook\uc2  applies its own content rules fairly, is doomed to failure. The social network has also\u160\'00\'A0 launched a long-awaited privacy tool. \u8220\'20\'1COff-\uc2 Facebook\uc2  activity\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0will allow users to prevent third-party websites from passing on their data to the social network for targeted advertising, in a move that could dent its revenues.\par \par \uc2 The Internet of (Six) Things\par \par \uc2 1. \uc2 EU\uc2  set to offer protection\u160\'00\'A0on facial recognition\par \par \uc2 As well as looking at the effects of Libra, Brussels is considering\u160\'00\'A0 strict limits on facial recognition technology \u160\'00\'A0in an attempt to stamp out surveillance of European citizens. The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  is planning regulation that will give \uc2 EU\uc2  citizens explicit rights and limit \u8220\'20\'1Cindiscriminate\u8221\'20\'1D use of facial recognition technology by companies and public authorities, senior officials told the FT. Brussels\u8217\'20\'19 initiative comes amid revelations about the use of the technology to monitor crowds in areas including\u160\'00\'A0 London\u8217\'20\'19s King\u8217\'20\'19s Cross, which last week prompted an investigation from the UK\u8217\'20\'19s data protection watchdog.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 2. Morning becomes expensive for Apple\par \par \uc2 Apple has committed more than $6bn for original shows and movies ahead of the launch of its new video streaming service, we revealed on Monday. The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars alone on a star-studded series featuring Jennifer Aniston, \uc2 Reese Witherspoon\uc2  and Steve Carell called The Morning Show.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 3. Physical stores fight \uc2 Amazon\uc2  with tech makeover\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Bricks and mortar is building an alternative to\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Amazon\uc2 , exposing its weakness in being a place to buy but not to have an experience. Stores are making better use of employees' downtime, getting them on iPads to chat with online shoppers as they use new tech services to\u160\'00\'A0 remake retail. Elsewhere, mega-retailer\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Walmart\uc2  has sued Tesla, alleging that its solar panels were responsible for fires at seven of its stores.\par \par \uc2 4.

Alibaba postpones HK listing\par \par \uc2 China's biggest ecommerce company has delayed its up to $15bn\u160\'00\'A0listing in Hong Kong amid growing political unrest there, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\u160\'00\'A0Alibaba held a board meeting before its latest quarterly earnings release last week, during which the board decided to postpone a listing that had been set to take place in late August, one of the people said.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 6. World's biggest chip\u160\'00\'A0created to handle AI\par \par \uc2 While chip circuitry continues to get smaller, the slab of silicon, developed by Californian start-up Cerebras, has a surface area slightly larger than a standard iPad and is the only one cut from a 300mm circular silicon wafer, which is usually sliced into\u160\'00\'A0dozens. It's aimed at the market for computers helping to train\u160\'00\'A0\b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  networks.\par \par \uc2 Tech tools \u8212\'20\'14 Apple's forthcoming hardware\par \par \uc2 Apple is readying new\u160\'00\'A0hardware for the coming weeks and months, including \u8220\'20\'1CPro\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0iPhones, upgrades to iPads\u160\'00\'A0and its largest laptop in years, according to Bloomberg.

"We want to do right by all of our participants to get them the information they need and referrals for follow-up care, if appropriate." Investor interest in genetics start-ups has been piqued by the soaring sales of consumer genetic tests available on sites such as \uc2 23andMe\uc2  and Ancestry, unearthing risks of serious disease or family secrets.\par \par \uc2 Color sells genetic testing packages including support for physicians and counselling to health systems, employers and research institutions. It was founded in 2013 by former Twitter executives Othman Laraki and Elad Gil, former cyber security engineer Nish Bhat and physician Taylor Sittler.\par \par \uc2 Mr Laraki, chief executive, said it was important to remember that genetic data held sensitive health information. He said the way the data had been used by "genetics hobbyists" had meant there were often not safeguards, including making counselling available so people could understand their results.\par \par \uc2 Color's five-year contract with the \uc2 NIH\uc2  begins with funding of $4.6m for the first year.\par \par \uc2 Since it opened in May 2018, All of Us has enrolled about 175,000 participants at a network of more than 340 recruitment sites across the US.\par \par \uc2 The programme, part of a broader government initiative in so-called precision health, aims to harvest data that includes information on 59 genes tied to risk of specific diseases for which there are established medical guidelines for treatment or prevention. Last week, the programme announced that more than 80 per cent of its participants so far were from groups that historically have been under-represented in biomedical research. The programme is working to connect them with care.\par \par \uc2 'We want to do right by all of our participants to get them the information they need and referrals '\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020190822ef8m000bs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Ms. Thomas, who joined \uc2 Groupon\uc2  in 2017 as vice president of commercial finance, has served as chief accounting officer and treasurer since November 2018.\par \par \uc2 The company didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.\par \par \uc2 The new finance chief will be expected to help Mr. Williams on his mission to lead the company to better financial health and more visibility into its future revenue. A subscription model that was launched in the second quarter is supposed to help with that, Mr. Forte said.

But \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  has an outsize impact on the Valley, so this emphasis could help change the focus of the industry, said one \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  alumni-turned-investor at the firm's Demo Day event Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Robot delivery wars: \uc2 Starship Technologies Inc\uc2 ., a startup developing self-driving delivery robots, has raised $40 million to compete with some deep-pocketed technology companies that are ramping up development of similar technology, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/delivery-robot-startup-secures-40-million-11566306001"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Marc Vartebedian reports }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * Starship will expand its service to roughly 100 university campuses over the next two years, Chief Executive Lex Bayer said. The startup currently offers meal delivery at roughly a dozen locations.\par \par \uc2 * Starship now has raised a total of $85 million, more than most of its privately held competitors, but it also faces technology giants such as \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and large food-delivery companies such as \uc2 Postmates Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Data-center market boom: Data centers are hot properties, even as many businesses are shedding them to shift their information-technology operations online, to the cloud, Angus Loten reports for the WSJ's CIO Journal. The warehouse-sized facilities that house racks of servers and other hardware can be costly and inefficient to manage. But some are being snapped up by data-center landlords, known as co-location service providers, which lease space in the facilities to cloud services offered tech companies. The rapid growth of cloud computing is heating up competition for new and used facilities and driving consolidation among data-center operators.\par \par \uc2 Newsletter Exclusive\par \par \uc2 For YC Deals, Investors Keep Valuation Complaints to Themselves\par \par \uc2 Investors often complain that \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  startups have high valuations relative to other similar startups. Still, those prices can vary widely, investors said at this year's Demo Day.\par \par \uc2 One \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  startup was raising $1.5 million at a $10 million valuation, intending to grow slowly and not raise too much, the founder said. Another hot startup was raising $10 million at a $40 million valuation, according to two investors familiar with the deal.\par \par \uc2 A third startup that was very popular with investors was raising an uncapped note, according to two investors. That rare structure is a convertible note that has no price cap on its conversion to equity, meaning investors don't know the valuation at which they're investing.\par \par \uc2 Overwhelming investor demand makes \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  startups command such high prices. Analysts at top venture firms run through the list of each batch of startups well before Demo Day, and firms pay top dollar to invest in advance, investors said.\par \par \uc2 \u8288\'20\'60\u8212\'20\'14Tomio Geron\par \par \uc2 VC Funds\par \par \uc2 Novalis LifeSciences said it raised $85 million for its first fund focused on life sciences companies. The New Hampshire firm said it would invest the fund, Novalis LifeSciences Investments I LP, in between eight and 12 companies in sectors such as drug discovery, life science tools, genomics, synthetic biology, diagnostics and agricultural biotechnology.\par \par \uc2 Fearless Fund is raising up to $5 million to invest in early-stage businesses led by women of color. The fund has held an undisclosed first close, a spokeswoman said. Fearless, which is led by founding partners Arian Simone and Keshia Knight Pulliam, already has five companies in its portfolio, including Ellis Island Tea. Early investors in the fund include actress and producer Marsai Martin, Dr. Jacqueline Walters of the Bravo TV show Married to Medicine and JumpFund.\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 Government cryptocurrency cop heads to law firm. Robert Cohen, the former government lawyer who managed Washington's crackdown on cryptocurrency fraud, is joining \uc2 Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP\uc2 , a white-shoe law firm whose clients include some of Wall Street's biggest banks and stock exchanges.\par \par \uc2 The truth about faster internet: It's not worth it. WSJ testing shows typical U.S. households don't use most of their bandwidth while streaming and get marginal gains from upgrading speeds\par \par \uc2 U.S. cities rethink data relationship with residents. Cities across the U.S. are getting in on the data game, measuring everything from air quality to traffic. Privacy rules and hackers' interest in such information, however, are prompting city officials to think carefully about how that information is managed.\par \par \uc2 Huawei CFO says Canada abused her rights. Huawei Technologies Co.'s chief financial officer argued in court documents made public Tuesday that Canadian efforts to extradite her to the U.S. should be stayed because of misconduct by Canadian and U.S. law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to let users control their data from other \uc2 companies.Facebook Inc\uc2 . said it would start letting users control the data it receives about them from other apps and websites off the platform, a step toward a pledge of enhanced privacy Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg made more than 15 months ago.\par \par \uc2 Walmart\uc2  sues Tesla over solar cells. \uc2 Walmart Inc\uc2 . is suing \uc2 Tesla Inc\uc2 ., alleging that some of the company's solar panels sparked roof fires at several of the retailer's locations, adding to the problems the electric-car maker has had with its venture to power homes and stores.\par \par \uc2 Social-media sites delicately foster online life after death. Social-media giants, with hundreds of millions of accounts, are increasingly grappling with how to handle digital legacies of users who have died.\par \par \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 , LG reach new chip-licensing deal. \uc2 Qualcomm Inc\uc2 . has reached a new patent-licensing deal with \uc2 LG Electronics Inc\uc2 . of South Korea, helping land its technology in a suite of wireless devices while U.S. federal regulators continue to scrutinize its business practices on antitrust grounds.\par \par \uc2 Around the Web\par \par \uc2 WeWork's IPO prospectus is a document defined by audaciousness.

Its \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  platform is used by more than 18,000 companies, including \uc2 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc\uc2 ., which uses it to price retail goods, and \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp\uc2 ., which uses it to help detect fraud, Mr. Ambati said. The platform offers a set of tools that are designed to simplify AI for nonexperts, and can be used for a range of applications.\par \par \uc2 Walgreens and Capital One didn't respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ambati, who often wears a driving cap, positions himself as a distinctive technologist who isn't afraid of mixing philosophy with business. In Wednesday's presentation, Mr. Ambati read a haiku and quoted T.S. Eliot and the ancient Chinese text "I Ching" to a room of about 250 listeners.\par \par \uc2 "The only renewable resource in the world is love, and love can break the barrier of time," he said, adding, "What is love really? It's about perfect comprehension. The more we learn about something, the closer we are to the truth."\par \par \uc2 In addition to founding H2O.ai, Mr. Ambati co-founded \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company \uc2 Platfora Inc\uc2 ., which was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/workday-nabs-platfora-for-nearly-200m-1469232319"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 acquired by Workday Inc. in 2016 }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 H2O.ai licenses its products to companies and charges them based on the number of users. It has tripled its customers over the past year-and-a-half, Mr. Ambati said.\par \par \uc2 "Our mission is to create a diverse set of AI juggernauts," he said.

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Companies that use \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  are strengthening their standards for the technology, creating governance policies and hiring executives to make sure their algorithms meet ethical and regulatory requirements.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co\uc2 . and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  software company Fair Isaac Co., creator of the widely used FICO credit score, are both rolling out in-house technology systems designed in part to track whether AI algorithms adhere to a set of standards. FICO is using blockchain for the project. And MassMutual recently named its first AI ethics and governance chief, responsible for implementing a new governance policy.\par \par \uc2 AI algorithms are becoming a core part of how companies function, used in automating repetitive tasks, improving customer service and more, said Jim Hare, research vice president for \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data science at Gartner Inc. But because algorithms can behave in unintended ways, he said, companies are trying to get a better grip on how they build and maintain them "to prevent AI gone wild."\par \par \uc2 "There's a risk aspect," Mr. Hare said. "If you deploy AI and it's intended to be used one way but gets used for whatever reason in the wrong way, or has unintended consequences, there's a brand reputation or even legal and financial risks in terms of exposure."\par \par \uc2 Companies building these systems may have industry-specific regulations\u8212\'20\'14such as fair-lending rules in finance\u8212\'20\'14that they want their algorithms to follow. They might also be anticipating {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cios-see-end-of-ai-gone-wild-in-congressional-hearings-11561586279"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 potential U.S. regulations }}}\uc2 , so they want detailed records on how their \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  models were developed and how they perform once deployed in the event an audit is needed.\par \par \uc2 The effort comes as corporate AI projects are on the rise. Gartner last month released a survey that found companies that were considered early AI adopters on average had four active AI projects, but respondents expected the number to double by next year and increase more than eightfold by 2022.\par \par \uc2 FICO and MassMutual both have dozens of data scientists producing scores of AI models annually. For example, FICO offers its banking clients \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  models that can determine if a credit-card transaction is likely to be fraudulent.\par \par \uc2 "When I'm building 200 or more models a year, I need consistency and I need to be able to review each and every model and call up how the model was built," said Scott Zoldi, FICO's chief \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  officer. "As practitioners, we need to make sure that they are understandable, that they make sense, that they're ethical and that they pass a level of review and scrutiny."\par \par \uc2 FICO, which has about 3,400 employees, has a 381-person data-science team that builds its AI tools.\par \par \uc2 For at least a decade, Mr. Zoldi said, the company has had AI compliance specialists who examine models for issues such as bias. But until recently, details about algorithms\u8212\'20\'14including who created them, what data they were trained with, release dates and performance metrics\u8212\'20\'14were recorded and managed through digital and paper documents.\par \par \uc2 To improve the process, FICO in February moved to a blockchain system. Best known as the record-keeping system behind cryptocurrencies, blockchain is a data structure that makes it possible to create and share a digital ledger of transactions among various parties. Data on blockchain is encrypted, unchangeable and always up-to-date for users.\par \par \uc2 For FICO, the blockchain system not only captures details of how algorithms were created, but also serves as a platform used to review and approve algorithms that meet its standards. For instance, the company requires that its models show the key relationships between variables driving its outcomes, such as those that lead it to approve or decline a credit-card transaction. Only those models that meet the transparency requirement can make it to client use.\par \par \uc2 MassMutual, which has 7,500 employees and roughly 50 data scientists, uses AI for various business cases, including models that help it determine insurance premiums by dividing applicants into risk classes.\par \par \uc2 Sears Merritt, its head of technology and data strategy and enterprise architecture, said MassMutual has some governance mechanisms in place, including systems that monitor algorithmic inputs and outcomes. But as the company continues to develop new AI products and services, he said it wants to make its standards more rigorous to meet or exceed possible future regulations.\par \par \uc2 To that end, Mr. Merritt said he and other executives last year drafted guidelines that touch on topics such as how the company's data are generated and how well its algorithms perform when making predictions or recommendations. MassMutual is developing a software system based on those guidelines that could include, for instance, setting limits on the false-positive rate for a predictive algorithm.\par \par \uc2 To oversee those efforts, the company in May tapped existing employee Kevin Fitzpatrick as its head of data and AI ethics and governance. He is expected to have a team of as many as 10 people by December, including a few AI ethics and governance consultants who will track how algorithms change over time and whether they adhere to governance policies.\par \par \uc2 In the future, Gartner's Mr. Hare expects large companies to increasingly hire "behavioral forensics" specialists whose duties include investigating AI systems that may have caused corporate or customer harm. He said the efforts by FICO and MassMutual are "really an early signal of something that's going to be much more transformative."\par \par \uc2 Write to Jared Council at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jared.council@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jared.council@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROAI20190820ef8k00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

By using AI to scrape for keywords in patent filings, \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  can find companies that are linked to new low-carbon technology.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you think about textual data, nobody can read everything,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ravit Mandell, the chief data scientist at JPMorgan, who recently helped launch a so-called \u8220\'20\'1CThemebot\u8221\'20\'1D algorithm designed to identify relevant information from unstructured data.\par \par \uc2 Other companies are employing similar methods. By using a data science team, portfolio managers can access more granular information than is usually available from a third party, said Richard Nackenson, who runs a multi-cap fund at \uc2 Neuberger Berman\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One example of how traditional analysis could miss key ESG themes can be seen in research into \uc2 Ball Corporation\uc2 , one of the largest manufacturers of aluminium cans in the US. Ball has scored poorly with ESG rating agencies because of its high energy usage, Mr Nackenson said. However, looking deeper into the company\u8217\'20\'19s ESG data and its products, Neuberger\u8217\'20\'19s data team saw an opportunity for future outperformance.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMany people didn\u8217\'20\'19t recognise that over 75 per cent of the aluminium that has ever been produced is still in use today\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09In the long run it reduces energy consumption and pollution,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. Furthermore, consumer tastes and behaviour are changing as people become more aware of the environmental problems caused by plastics, and that is good news for a company like Ball, Mr Nackenson added.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, financiers warn there are still limits to what data science, and AI, can do. \u8220\'20\'1CBy definition, since data is by its nature backward looking, so are the screens applied to it,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 Lazard Asset Management\uc2  pointed out in a recent research report. \u8220\'20\'1CIf one assumes ESG data does imact stock prices, the implication is that historical data is already reflected in today\u8217\'20\'19s prices.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 When it comes to regulatory risk, AI may not be the most suitable tool for ESG analysis, added Sudhir Roc-Sennett, who is the head of thought leadership and ESG at the Vontobel Quality Growth fund.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe look at large powerful companies which tend to be dominant players in their area,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1C[But] regulation can cause existential risk \u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09and that\u8217\'20\'19s where the analysts have to talk to management and talk to competitors, lawmakers and lawyers. You need humans to search for red flags.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Weekly newsletter\par \par \uc2 Your trusted guide to the fast-expanding world of ESG, Impact Investing, Socially Responsible Business and Corporate Purpose.\par \par \uc2 Sign up here with one click\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020190820ef8k002jp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

It adds to the billions of dollars Juul pulled in last year from private investors and \uc2 Altria\uc2 , the Marlboro maker, which paid $12.8bn for a 35 per cent stake in the company in December.\par \par \uc2 Tiger Global Management\uc2 , which led an investment valuing the company at $15bn last July, participated in the new debt offering, one of the people familiar with the transaction said. The firm declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Juul disclosed the fundraising yesterday in a filing with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , which said it had raised the money from four investors.\par \par \uc2 The ecigarette maker quickly rose last year to become one of the largest venture-backed US companies, worth more on paper than \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 , the home rental provider, and Palantir, the data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company. \uc2 Altria\uc2  valued the company at $38bn with its share purchase.\par \par \uc2 Extra cash could bolster Juul's efforts to sell its products outside of the US, where the company has been scrutinised for the uptake of its products among teenagers. This month it began selling an ecigarette in the UK that monitors vaping habits and requires users to undergo multiple age verification steps.\par \par \uc2 The authorities in San Francisco barred the sale of Juul and other e-cigarettes in June, becoming the first city to impose an outright ban to curb underage vaping. Juul, based in the city, has waged a lobbying campaign arguing that the ban will punish adult cigarette smokers trying to quit instead of preventing underage sales.\par \par \uc2 Ecigarette companies are expected to submit their products for \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  approval, which would allow them to be sold when the ban takes effect early next year.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020190820ef8k000bo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Technology teams at large companies are moving beyond their traditional role in business support as their bosses encourage them to use their skills to develop marketable products and services.\par \par \uc2 The blurring of lines between IT and business groups reflects the fact that coding and the ability to analyze data are now central to product development. Tech teams at large corporations including credit-card giant \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 . and logistics company \uc2 United Parcel Service Inc\uc2 . have developed new tools for employees and customers in the past few years.\par \par \uc2 Employees can get time, and sometimes money, to pursue projects that executives see as having strong market potential. Accounting firm \uc2 Ernst & Young LLP\uc2  this year gave a team of employees in Australia $100,000 to build a tool that uses automation to manage cybersecurity. It is currently being developed for client use.\par \par \uc2 "It's more important than ever for us to make sure the right ideas are bubbling up from people on the ground," said Jeff Wong, global chief innovation officer for Ernst & Young, which brands itself as EY.\par \par \uc2 Large organizations need to make an effort to adapt to change quickly, Mr. Wong said, where in the past, they could afford to wait to see how change affected the market.\par \par \uc2 At UPS, the rise of e-commerce and increasing global trade have spurred "unprecedented demand" for new ideas, said Juan Perez, the firm's chief information and engineering officer. Because employees understand customers, their ideas are helping UPS keep pace with competition and anticipate future needs, he said. "No matter what level you're in, we all have an obligation to keep thinking of ideas that make the business better," he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Perez encourages employees to come up with novel ideas and work with UPS's legal team to patent them. Six employees in Mr. Perez's IT group came up with a patented idea that was rolled out in 2017 called Preload Smart Scan.\par \par \uc2 The system uses Bluetooth-enabled electronic beacons in UPS delivery vehicles to notify workers if they have placed an item in the wrong vehicle, a problem that affects delivery timelines. The beacons send signals to scanners that read package labels, and the scanner notifies the employee if a package has been misloaded.\par \par \uc2 A patent developed by a UPS employee is owned by the company; Mr. Perez came up with 10 patents and has seven pending.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Visa\uc2 , all employees are allowed to spend 10% of their time pursuing new ideas that relate to the company's strategic objectives.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the most breakthrough innovations come from the front lines," said \uc2 Rajat Taneja\uc2 , the company's executive vice president of technology and operations, who helped spearhead the 10% program five years ago. Fostering a culture that enables significant innovation has never been more important, he added.\par \par \uc2 The company prides itself on letting employees test new ideas without a lot of bureaucracy, through hackathons and internal forums where employees can get real-time feedback.\par \par \uc2 Visa\uc2 's employees have come up with 2,500 ideas to date, some of which have resulted in new capabilities for \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , security and improving business processes, Mr. Taneja said.\par \par \uc2 One such idea resulted in a tool called Visa Transaction Controls, one of the most frequently used application-programming interfaces among \uc2 Visa\uc2  customers. APIs are pieces of software that enable apps, platforms and systems to connect with each other and share data.\par \par \uc2 The tool was developed by two employees in 2015. \uc2 Visa\uc2  customers, such as banks and small businesses, can integrate the tool into their apps to let cardholders set spending limits, receive transaction alerts and temporarily suspend accounts.\par \par \uc2 Homegrown innovation is particularly important for established companies, Mr. Taneja said. Being in a dominant position can lead to complacency. "If you aren't creating and incubating new ideas\u8230\'20\'26someone else surely is," he said.\par \par \uc2 Peter Skyttegaard, senior research director at Gartner Inc., said innovation has been a popular topic of conversation among analysts and senior technology leaders in recent months. Older, more established enterprises are being forced to change more quickly because of increasing competition, he said: "Part of it is the fear of being disrupted."\par \par \uc2 Write to Sara Castellanos at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:sara.castellanos@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sara.castellanos@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020190820ef8k005xx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The London buyout group's offer surpassed interest from rivals including \uc2 BC Partners\uc2  and PAI in Europe and \uc2 TA Associates\uc2  and \uc2 Hellman & Friedman\uc2  in the US, said people familiar with the auction.\par \par \uc2 Hg, Cogital's buyout group owner, is to keep a "significant" position in the company, said people briefed on the deal. A formal announcement could come this week, they said, but people following the process said the timing could slip and a deal was not guaranteed.\par \par \uc2 Groups involved in the auction, and Cogital, declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2016 from the merger of Nordic-based Azets and UK-based Baldwins and Blick Rothenberg, Cogital is led by John Connolly, former Deloitte UK chief executive.\par \par \uc2 The accountancy group's revenues exceeded \u163\'00\'A3500m last year, as it posted \u163\'00\'A368m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.\par \par \uc2 The UK group has net debt of \u163\'00\'A3343m, according to figures seen by the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 . The majority of its business is from the Nordic region and the UK.\par \par \uc2 Cogital, which was set up as an alternative to the big accountancy firms, makes use of so-called smart technology and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to service its clients and self-service tools to help its customers process reports and invoices.\par \par \uc2 The accountancy group has more than 6,500 employees in eight countries and has corporate customers in 60 countries. Cogital has recently expanded partly as a result of the acquisition of smaller accountants, among them Wilkins Kennedy, a rival firm, in 2018.\par \par \uc2 The Cogital sale comes at a time when the big accountancy companies are facing the prospect of legislation that could force them to split up their UK businesses.\par \par \uc2 KPMG\uc2 , PwC, EY and Deloitte the Big Four are facing pressure from politicians and regulators over worries about the quality of their audit work following a series of corporate failures and scandals involving groups such as \uc2 Carillion\uc2 , the outsourcer, and Patisserie Valerie, the caf\u233\'00\'E9 chain.\par \par \uc2 Permira\uc2  bought \uc2 Duff & Phelps\uc2 , a professional services group that competes with large accountancy firms, for $1.75bn in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Private equity's interest in Cogital has led to speculation that private equity groups could step up their interest in the sector.\par \par \uc2 Last year, several buyout groups approached \uc2 KPMG\uc2  about a proposed takeover of its UK restructuring business, but were rejected.\par \par \uc2 Audit firm makes use of smart technology and AI to service its clients\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020190819ef8j0004m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 TORONTO -- Silicon Valley is invading Toronto.\par \par \uc2 Intel Corp\uc2 . has announced plans to build a graphics-chip design lab in Canada's largest city. Car-hailing service \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . will be opening an engineering hub. \uc2 Google\uc2 's parent, \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 ., proposed building a new Toronto campus as part of a sensor-laden "smart city" on the Lake Ontario waterfront, and \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . said it would expand its Canadian workforce by more than 20%.\par \par \uc2 There has been so much activity that \uc2 Silicon Valley Bank\uc2 , the Santa Clara, Calif., financier for some of the world's largest venture-capital firms and startups, opened an office here in March after 19 years of handling Canadian business from Seattle and Boston.\par \par \uc2 "There's a hell of a lot more going on up here than we appreciated," said Win Bear, head of business development for \uc2 Silicon Valley Bank\uc2 's Canada operation.\par \par \uc2 Technology companies are hiring more workers in Toronto, attracted by the region's diverse population of 6.4 million, a deep pool of skilled labor and cultural similarities to major U.S. cities such as San Francisco, New York and Chicago.\par \par \uc2 Many Canadians are wary of the influx. Some worry about the invasion of Big Tech, while others say U.S. businesses are crowding out domestic companies and siphoning some of the country's most valuable intellectual assets.\par \par \uc2 "We are squandering our future," said \uc2 Jim Balsillie\uc2 , former co-chief executive of BlackBerry Ltd., whose smartphones were once ubiquitous. Canada isn't benefiting from recent innovations local researchers have made in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , voice and image recognition and self-driving automobiles because they are employed by foreign companies that own the intellectual property, he said.\par \par \uc2 Patent lawyer Jim Hinton said foreign companies own about 70% of the roughly 1,600 AI and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  patents filed by Canadians at the \uc2 U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\uc2  since 2015.\par \par \uc2 Those concerns haven't stopped Canada's top officials from inviting big U.S. companies north. Last year, \uc2 Justin Trudeau\uc2  became the first Canadian prime minister to visit San Francisco in more than 70 years. During his visit, \uc2 Salesforce.com Inc\uc2 . said it would invest $2 billion in Canada over the next five years. It isn't clear how much of that sum \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  has invested already, and company representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 AppDirect\uc2 , a company that develops online stores for business-software applications, committed to hiring 300 people as part of a Canadian expansion. A spokeswoman said it is on track to hire at least 60 people in Canada since Mr. Trudeau's visit and expects to accelerate that pace in the coming years.\par \par \uc2 Those investments helped boost foreign investment in Canada's information and communications technology industries by 21% between 2017 and 2018, compared with a 3% decline a year earlier, according to \uc2 Statistics Canada\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Privacy concerns are worrying some Canadians. A proposal by \uc2 Google\uc2  affiliate Sidewalk Labs to build a city "from the internet up" on Toronto's waterfront has become a flashpoint for critics concerned about how the company would handle data collected by sensors throughout the planned neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 Resident Julie Beddoes supports a volunteer-led group that is opposing the Sidewalk project. She also said that companies like \uc2 Google\uc2  are following a pattern that is familiar in Canada, where large U.S. companies come north and push out smaller, domestic firms. "I'm concerned the big bulldozing megacorporations coming in will make it harder for our younger people to start their own companies," she said.\par \par \uc2 Sabrina Geremia, head of \uc2 Google\uc2 's Canadian business operations, said the company employs more than 400 people in Toronto and roughly 1,200 in Canada, serving as an anchor tenant that attracts engineers and developers to the city. Many of those arrivals help expand the broader tech community by joining other companies or launching their own, she said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Jacquie McNish contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 A Cheap Pay Scale\par \par \uc2 Helps City's Profile\par \par \uc2 Toronto, North America's fourth-largest city, is cheaper than several large U.S. cities: Its computer engineers and programmers earn salaries that are on average $71,000 a year lower than their counterparts in San Francisco, according to recruiting platform Hired Inc.\par \par \uc2 By hiring in Toronto, companies can get around the Trump administration's tough immigration rules that have made it more difficult to hire foreign workers in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Toronto is also benefiting from Canada's fast-track visa program and a universal health-care system that lowers companies' costs of providing employee benefits.\par \par \uc2 Those attributes helped propel the city to the final round of \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .'s search for a second headquarters, the only non-U.S. city to make the cut. Though Toronto lost the bid, \uc2 Amazon\uc2  still opened a 113,000-square-foot office in the downtown core in December and said it would hire 600 new employees.\par \par \uc2 The links between San Francisco and Toronto have grown so tight that airlines added 139 flights between the cities in the past two years, according to travel data provider OAG.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw480\pich504\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7200\pichgoal7560

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2  is leaning on its employees, including Chief Executive \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , for cash as the firm rushes to raise an ambitious technology fund amid volatile markets.\par \par \uc2 The Japanese company plans to lend up to $20 billion to its employees to buy stakes in its second giant venture-capital fund, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Son may account for as much as $15 billion of that amount, some of the people said.\par \par \uc2 It is an unusual setup that would doubly expose SoftBank to a startup economy that is starting to show cracks.\par \par \uc2 The window for initial public offerings, which appeared wide open early this year, may be closing as markets tumble and public investors grow weary of unprofitable startups.\par \par \uc2 At $20 billion, the employee pool would represent nearly a fifth of the money that SoftBank said in July it had lined up for its second Vision Fund, a successor to a $100 billion fund that launched in 2017 and is nearly spent.\par \par \uc2 Adding in its own contribution to the second fund of $38 billion, SoftBank could make up more than half of the money raised, far more than is typical for a fund sponsor.\par \par \uc2 A Vision Fund spokesman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  controls \uc2 Sprint Corp\uc2 . and other telecommunications companies. It launched its first fund with $60 billion in backing from government investment funds from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi and quickly roiled the tech market by making huge investments in \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 ., WeWork, Chinese ride-hailing company \uc2 Didi Chuxing Technology Co\uc2 . and other companies, helping to drive up their valuations. The funds are supposed to tap the vision of Mr. Son, who has made huge profit on tech investments, and the new effort is expected to be focused on \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  said it has $108 billion from investors including \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 ., the government of Kazakhstan and half a dozen banks.\par \par \uc2 Those commitments aren't binding and are being completed during a tumultuous stretch for startups, including some of the Vision Fund's largest investments.\par \par \uc2 Shares of Uber have fallen 30% since the company went public in May. The stock now trades below the roughly $35 level that SoftBank paid to acquire its stake, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 WeWork, another big Vision Fund investment, filed last week to go public, disclosing losses that are enormous and growing fast, even by Silicon Valley standards.\par \par \uc2 The company will likely need large sums of cash for years as it builds out offices. This could affect WeWork's most recent $47 billion valuation, which one analyst called "very hard to swallow" in light of the company's huge losses.\par \par \uc2 Most investment funds simply give their employees a share of the profit as part of their compensation. Investors like to see such skin in the game.\par \par \uc2 But SoftBank is instead lending to staff -- it has about 400 employees -- to buy those stakes, charging around 5% interest and in most cases requiring little money down, said people familiar with the arrangement, which is likely to be completed in the coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 It did the same thing for the first fund, which now includes about $8 billion of employee money, those people said. The lending adds leverage to the Vision Fund's already risky investments and, if the fund struggles, would put SoftBank in an awkward position trying to collect from some of its most senior executives and could ultimately lose money.\par \par \uc2 Much of Mr. Son's wealth is tied up in his shares of SoftBank itself, which he could be forced to sell to repay the loans.\par \par \uc2 For that reason, loans to top executives must typically be explained to shareholders. The stakes also could be considered compensation, which companies must disclose annually for executives at the level of Mr. Son and Vision Fund CEO \uc2 Rajeev Misra\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  executives believe the loans will better align its managers' interests with those of Vision Fund investors because the fund investments can be canceled if someone departs or is found to have done a reckless deal, people familiar with their thinking said.\par \par \uc2 Other investors in the fund include the government fund of Kazakhstan, which is likely to contribute about $3 billion, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Banks including \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Standard Chartered PLC\uc2  and Japan's \uc2 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc\uc2 . have signaled they are willing to invest several hundred million dollars apiece, which bankers view as a way to get hired on deals and IPOs for Vision Fund's roughly 75 portfolio companies.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  is negotiating with several pensions and insurers, including in Taiwan, for combined investments it hopes will exceed $30 billion, some of the people said. Taiwan's insurers are searching for higher-yielding investments to help them close the gap between promised payouts for older policies and returns they are getting on investments now.\par \par \uc2 But large-scale investments could be a stretch for them because Taiwanese regulations only allow them to put a fraction of their assets into riskier investments like venture capital.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Phred Dvorak contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20190819000064"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020190819ef8j00011\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The unusual suit highlights the sensitive relations between companies that have been hacked and their business partners, WSJ Pro's Catherine Stupp reports.\par \par \uc2 Also today: \uc2 U.S. Army\uc2 's cyber talent shortage is becoming a problem for warfare readiness, a GAO report says; \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  website attacked; and \uc2 Instagram\uc2  users can flag fake content.\par \par \uc2 Stay informed: Follow us on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at @WSJCyber.\par \par \uc2 Delta Sues Chatbot Provider Over 2017 Breach\par \par \uc2 By Catherine Stupp\par \par \uc2 Delta Air Lines Inc\uc2 . is suing an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  company that powered a chatbot on the carrier's website, accusing it of lax cybersecurity that caused a 2017 data breach. The unusual lawsuit highlights the sensitive relations between companies that have been hacked and their business partners.\par \par \uc2 Companies rarely sue technology providers over data breaches because their contracts generally specify the level of third-party suppliers' liability and because the two partner firms typically end up settling out of court, cybersecurity lawyers said.\par \par \uc2 Delta's lawsuit, filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that chatbot provider [24]7.ai Inc. lacked basic cybersecurity safeguards while running the AI-powered service on Delta's website in 2017 and 2018. The suit also says [24]7 waited more than five months to inform the airline of the breach instead of telling it immediately, and did so using LinkedIn instead of official channels\u8212\'20\'14potentially violating the companies' contract. It couldn't be learned whether the contract between Delta and the chatbot provider had any unusual clauses.\par \par \uc2 William Bose, [24]7's senior vice president and acting general counsel, said the chatbot company intends to defend itself vigorously.\par \par \uc2 "This has been an ongoing issue between the companies and nothing new has arisen, except that Delta has chosen to litigate this matter," he said in an email through a spokesman. They declined to address specific allegations.\par \par \uc2 Delta and a lawyer representing the airline declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The airline disclosed the incident last year and said credit-card details and other personal information from up to 825,000 customers were exposed.\par \par \uc2 Delta is seeking reimbursement from [24]7 for all costs related to the breach, totaling millions of dollars, according to the suit. The airline hasn't disclosed expenses from the incident in its financial filings.\par \par \uc2 Hackers Allegedly Modified Source Code\par \par \uc2 Privately held [24]7, founded in 2000 and based in San Jose, Calif., uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to create customer-assistance products such as chatbots, consumer \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  programs and digital advertising services, according to its website.\par \par \uc2 The bot on Delta's website allowed customers to get information about purchasing tickets, changing itineraries and other requests, the lawsuit said. Hackers accessed [24]7's systems and modified source code, letting them scrape Delta customers' personal data and payment-card details from the airline's website, according to the suit.\par \par \uc2 The airline accuses 24[7] of failing to implement basic security controls such as requiring multifactor authentication for employees accessing source code and forbidding staff members from using the same login credentials, according to the complaint. Hackers modified the chatbot's source code using compromised credentials, then monitored activity on Delta's website and captured data that visitors entered there.\par \par \uc2 The breach wouldn't have happened if [24]7 had implemented "even basic access restrictions," the lawsuit said.\par \par \uc2 Companies' relationships with technology providers can come under scrutiny after a data breach. \uc2 As Capital\uc2  One Financial Corp. announced a breach in late July, it specified the problem wasn't caused by any security flaw in the cloud technology it uses. The bank has moved significant bank operations to \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .'s cloud services over the past several years.\par \par \uc2 Delta's filing of the lawsuit nearly two years after hackers accessed customer data suggests that negotiations with [24]7 collapsed, lawyers said.\par \par \uc2 "You can't just come out with both barrels pointed because in the immediate aftermath of a security incident, everybody is trying to figure out what happened," said Linn Freedman, a partner at law firm \uc2 Robinson & Cole LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some contracts state that technology suppliers must implement strong cybersecurity measures and have unlimited liability for breaches, said Ieuan Jolly, co-chair of the privacy, security and data innovations practice at law firm \uc2 Loeb & Loeb LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "When you have a large, sophisticated customer like Delta negotiating with a smaller vendor, the smaller vendor doesn't have much leverage to push back on these fairly stringent contractual security obligations," he said.\par \par \uc2 Requiring Immediate Notification\par \par \uc2 Delta said [24]7 violated contract provisions requiring it use adequate security measures, including encryption, to protect customer data.\par \par \uc2 New laws such as the \uc2 European Union\uc2 's 2018 General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect next year, increase pressure on companies to secure data. As a result, companies now seek higher limits on their technology providers' liability, Mr. Jolly said. Before the GDPR went into effect in May 2018, Mr. Jolly said he renegotiated around 100 contracts to increase the cap on technology suppliers' liability.\par \par \uc2 Delta alleges that [24]7's Mr. Bose already knew about the breach when he signed a document in February 2018 stating that the technology company would comply with the GDPR and would immediately inform Delta about data breaches.\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 4.1 Billion\par \par \uc2 Estimated number of records breached in incidents reported in the first half of the year, according to research firm RiskBased Security.\par \par \uc2 More Cyber News\par \par \uc2 A website belonging to the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  shuts down after hack. The \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  shut down a site that financial firms use to produce reports after hackers compromised subscriber data, Claims Journal reports. Attackers also injected malware onto the server to aid in phishing activities, according to the ECB, which is notifying affected individuals.\par \par \uc2 Instagram\uc2  users have new tools to signal fake posts. \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 .'s photo site, in an effort to stem the spread of disinformation, created the capability for \uc2 Instagram\uc2  users to report possibly inaccurate content, Reuters reports.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Army\uc2 's cyber program is hampered by talent shortage. The \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  says trouble finding and retaining cybersecurity personnel is holding back plans to expand cyber warfare capabilities, FedScoop reports. The Army is increasing compensation to address its most acute shortage at the senior enlisted level. Several cyber units formed in recent months have few positions filled, including one with 30 individuals of 171 positions allocated.\par \par \uc2 Capital One cyber staff raised concerns before hack. Before a giant data breach at \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp\uc2 ., employees raised concernswithin the company about what they saw as high turnover in its cybersecurity unit and a failure to promptly install some software to help spot and defend against hacks, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20190816ef8g0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

A number of startups provide \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -based tools to medical professionals and researchers, but fewer focus on giving individual consumers access to AI in making decisions related to their health.\par \par \uc2 Buoy Health Inc., which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/buoy-health-gets-15-million-for-digital-triage-technology-11565905851"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 just raised $15 million }}}\uc2  in its Series B round, says its AI-based service can help consumers decide whether a trip to the emergency room is warranted. By inputting their symptoms onto the company's website, consumers, health plan members and employees of self-insured companies can gain insight into the type of care they need\u8212\'20\'14helping them decide, for example, if their abdominal pain is a cause for concern or likely just constipation.\par \par \uc2 Boston-based Buoy's focus on consumers, health insurers and self-insured employers distinguishes it from several other startups that instead provide AI tools to health-care professionals. These include HealthReveal Inc., backed by Flare Capital Partners and others, which uses AI to help physicians provide optimal care, and Emedgene Inc., which raised a $6 million led by Olive Tree Ventures earlier this year to ramp up sales of AI-based software that automates genetic interpretation, so geneticists don't miss vital bits of information revealed in a genetic test.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Autonomous trucking partnership: United Parcel Service Inc.'s venture-capital division, UPS Ventures, has acquired a minority stake in self-driving trucking startup TuSimple Inc., signaling the delivery company's continued push into autonomous driving, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-ventures-invests-in-self-driving-trucking-startup-11565874002"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * UPS also will expand a partnership it began with TuSimple earlier in March for the startup to carry truckloads of goods between Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., according to UPS Ventures Managing Partner Todd Lewis.\par \par \uc2 * The two companies are looking to add more routes to run self-driving tests in the Western U.S., said Chuck Price, chief product officer of TuSimple.\par \par \uc2 * Mr. Lewis said the collaboration with TuSimple is intended to help UPS figure out how it could implement fully autonomous trucks in its freight network.\par \par \uc2 About those losses: As WeWork heads toward an initial public offering, the office-space company faces a fundamental problem: Its losses are growing as fast as its revenue, the WSJ's Eliot Brown and Heather Somerville report.\par \par \uc2 WeWork's parent company, We Cos., whose main business is renting and remodeling offices to sublease to other companies, revealed in its IPO filing operating losses that ballooned 102% to $1.37 billion for the first six months of the year compared with a year earlier. This suggests the nine-year-old company isn't wringing out enough cost savings as it gets bigger. The lack of scaling is a potentially troubling sign for a company that has commanded a valuation more akin to a tech company than a real-estate firm.\par \par \uc2 Shasta Exits: \uc2 Shasta Ventures\uc2  will lose its second managing director this summer with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shasta-ventures-managing-director-nikhil-basu-trivedi-is-leaving-11565909715"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 planned departure of Nikhil Basu Trivedi }}}\uc2 . Mr. Trivedi, who focused on consumer deals, is leaving soon after the exit of \uc2 Doug Pepper\uc2 , who focused on software deals. Menlo Park, Calif.-based Shasta is in the middle of raising money for its next fund, which is likely to shrink and focus on enterprise software, people familiar with its plans said.\par \par \uc2 Vegan Supply Chain: Motif FoodWorks Inc. hopes it can become a valuable partner to vegan-food producers by supplying the ingredients they need, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/motif-foodworks-raises-27-5-million-11565913599"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports }}}\uc2 . Launched earlier this year out of synthetic-biology startup \uc2 Ginkgo Bioworks Inc\uc2 ., Motif said it raised $27.5 million in a funding round led by \uc2 General Atlantic\uc2 . Motif aims to wedge its way into the sector by handling some of the most time-consuming and expensive parts of the food-development process.\par \par \uc2 Indoor farming's promise: Jonathan Webb's vision is to turn economically distressed eastern Kentucky into a high-tech agriculture capital of the country. He has no prior experience in farming, but he has managed to attract $97 million in project financing and a list of noteworthy partners for his startup, AppHarvest. Ultimately, he plans to spend $1 billion to $2 billion on greenhouses\u8212\'20\'14even if it takes a decade or two, the WSJ's Leigh Kamping-Carder reports.\par \par \uc2 Exits\par \par \uc2 Cloudflare Inc\uc2 . disclosed paperwork for a planned initial public offering. The San Francisco-based cybersecurity company said it blocks 44 billion cyber threats from 20 million internet properties a day. In 2018, the company reported a loss of $87.2 million on revenue of $192.7 million, compared with a $10.7 million loss on revenue of $134.9 million the year before. \uc2 New Enterprise Associates\uc2  owns 20% of \uc2 Cloudflare\uc2 's shares, while Pelion Ventures, Venrock and \uc2 Fidelity Management & Research\uc2  hold smaller stakes. \uc2 Cloudflare\uc2  plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "NET." \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  are among the offering's underwriters.\par \par \uc2 VC Funds\par \par \uc2 Pear Ventures seeks to raise up to $155 million for its third main fund, according to a regulatory filing. No commitments have been received for the fund, Pear Ventures III LP, the filing indicates. Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Pear changed its name from Pejman Mar Ventures in 2016 when it announced a $75 million second fund. The firm makes early-stage investments from the pre-seed through Series A stages, according to its website. Active portfolio companies include on-demand delivery business \uc2 DoorDash Inc\uc2 . and mobile software development startup Branch Metrics Inc. Pear also was an investor in \uc2 Guardant Health Inc\uc2 ., which went public in October 2018.\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 The startups safeguarding real estate. A number of startups have emerged to protect buyers and sellers from real-estate fraud by schemers and scammers.\par \par \uc2 WeWork bond prices surge on buyback hopes. WeWork's debt is surging following the company's S-1 filing for a proposed IPO, as investors bet the company could retire bonds before they mature in 2025.\par \par \uc2 Hackers subvert security checks like the browser padlock. Recent attacks have shown that cybercriminals have co-opted techniques and toolsthat people commonly use to distinguish real communications and websites from fake ones, such as the padlock in a browser window.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors accuse Capital One hacker of hitting dozens more targets. The woman charged with hacking into millions of \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp\uc2 . records hit more than 30 other targets, federal prosecutors said, significantly expanding the scale of what was already considered one of the largest heists of data stored in the cloud.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Shooting,' \u8216\'20\'18bomb,' \u8216\'20\'18Trump': advertisers blacklist news stories online.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc97}{\*\bkmkend toc97}\b \uc2 Advertiser Blacklists Hobble Publishers --- 'Bomb' and 'Trump' are among the words marketers insist not appear near ads online\b0\par\par\uc2 By Suzanne Vranica \par \uc2 2,028 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 August 2019\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Like many advertisers, \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2  wants to avoid advertising online near controversial content. As a result, the Boston-based financial-services company has a lengthy blacklist of words it considers off-limits.\par \par \uc2 If one of those words is in an article's headline, \uc2 Fidelity\uc2  won't place an ad there. Its list earlier this year, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, contained more than 400 words, including "bomb," "immigration" and "racism." Also off-limits: "Trump."\par \par \uc2 Some news organizations have had difficulty placing \uc2 Fidelity\uc2 's ads on their sites, ad-sales executives said, because the list is so exhaustive and the terms appear in many news articles.\par \par \uc2 Big advertisers have been burned several times in recent years when their digital ads appeared next to offensive content, including fabricated news articles, hateful or racist videos on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  and pornographic material.\par \par \uc2 Such miscues happen, in part, because of the complexities of online ad-buying, where brands generally target certain kinds of audiences rather than specific sites or types of content. It has become clear to advertisers that one way to protect themselves is to stipulate types of web content they want to avoid, and ensure their partners -- digital ad brokers and publishers -- honor those wishes.\par \par \uc2 "Political stories are, regardless of party affiliation, not relevant to our brand," a Fidelity spokesman said in a written statement. The company also avoids several other topics that it says don't align with published content about business and finance.\par \par \uc2 Marketers have used blacklists for years to sidestep controversy. Airlines avoided articles dealing with airline crashes. Now those blacklists are becoming more sophisticated, specific and extensive, ad executives said.\par \par \uc2 Online news publishers are feeling the impact, from smaller outlets to large players such as CNN.com, USA Today-owner Gannett Co., the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  and the Journal, according to news and ad executives.\par \par \uc2 The ad blacklisting threatens to hit publications' revenue and is creating incentives to produce more lifestyle-oriented coverage that is less controversial than hard news. Some new organizations are investing in technologies meant to gauge the way news stories make readers feel in the hopes of convincing advertisers there are options for ad placement other than blacklisting.\par \par \uc2 Consumer-products company \uc2 Colgate-Palmolive Co\uc2 ., sandwich chain Subway and fast-food giant \uc2 McDonald's Corp\uc2 . are among the many companies blocking digital ad placements in hard news to various degrees, according to people familiar with those companies' strategies.\par \par \uc2 Some companies are creating keyword blacklists so detailed as to make almost all political or hard-news stories off-limits for their ads. "It is de facto news blocking," said Megan Pagliuca, chief data officer at Hearts & Science, an ad-buying firm owned by \uc2 Omnicom Group Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The use of lengthy keyword lists "is going to force publishers to do lifestyle content and focus on that at the expense of investigative journalism or serious journalism," said Nick Hewat, commercial director for Guardian News & Media, publisher of U.K.'s Guardian. "That is a long-term consequence of this sort of buying behavior." \uc2 The Guardian\uc2  has had some advertisers block words such as "Brexit," he said.\par \par \uc2 During the second quarter of this year, 177 advertisers that worked with ad measurement firm \uc2 DoubleVerify Inc\uc2 . blocked their ads from appearing on news or political content online, up 33% from the year-earlier period and more than double the 2017 total, the company said.\par \par \uc2 Integral Ad Science Inc\uc2 ., a firm that ensures ads run in content deemed safe for advertisers, said that of the 2,637 advertisers running campaigns with it in June, 1,085 brands blocked the word "shooting," 314 blocked "ISIS" and 207 blocked "Russia." Almost 560 advertisers blocked "Trump," while 83 blocked "Obama."\par \par \uc2 The average number of keywords the company's advertisers were blocking in the first quarter was 261. One advertiser blocked 1,553 words, it said.\par \par \uc2 The polarized political environment in the U.S. has put brands on heightened alert. Marketers are mindful of the backlash they can face on social media when customers feel they advertised alongside offensive content. One \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account, Sleeping Giants, publicized hundreds of brands that appeared on the right-wing news site \uc2 Breitbart News Network\uc2  following the 2016 presidential election, prompting widespread blacklisting of the site by advertisers.\par \par \uc2 Colgate-Palmolive\uc2  is blocking online ad placements in news stories, according to people with knowledge of its ad strategy. "In general, our media buying goals are to advertise where people are most likely to be receptive to what we have to say," a Colgate spokesman said. The company said it looks for "opportunities more likely to fit with the brand's positive, optimistic message."\par \par \uc2 Subway said it has blacklisted 70,000 websites, including most hard-news outlets. The company wants to align with "positivity and the moments when our guests will be most likely to consider getting Subway," said Melissa Sutton, Subway's director of media services.\par \par \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  currently is blocking hard news from its automated ad purchases in the U.S., according to a person familiar with its ad buying. "The first time your brand is damaged, it's not easily fixed," said Bob Rupczynski, senior vice president of marketing technology at McDonald's, during a recent ad conference in Cannes, France.\par \par \uc2 Hotel company \uc2 Marriott International Inc\uc2 . avoids buying digital ads near opinion or commentary news, according to a person familiar with its approach.\par \par \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  has a long keyword blacklist for advertising its own products, which contains more than 500 words and phrases, including "privacy," "federal investigation," "antitrust," "racism," "\uc2 FBI\uc2 ," "taxes," "anti-Semitic," "gun control" and "drought," according to a copy reviewed by the Journal. The list has made it difficult for at least one news publisher to place Google ads on its site, a person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Blacklisting is cutting into the revenue of some online news publishers, even though they sometimes can replace blocked ads.\par \par \uc2 The audiences of many online publishers grew after President Trump launched his campaign -- the "Trump bump." At the same time, "they are losing revenue because some clients are using extensive keyword exclusion lists," said John Montgomery, executive vice president of global brand safety at GroupM, one of the world's largest ad-buying firms.\par \par \uc2 It is worrisome for the news business, a sector already taking a hit as advertising spending shifts to online ad giants \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Google\uc2 . Spending on newspaper print ads in the U.S. has fallen 32% over the past five years, according to estimates from Zenith, an ad-buying company owned by \uc2 Publicis Groupe SA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CNN.com, which is owned by \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 ., said it deals with some advertisers whose blacklists exceed 1,000 words. Among the words advertisers most often wanted to avoid on CNN.com during the first half of the year were "shooting," "Mueller," "\uc2 Michael Cohen\uc2 " and "crash." The most-blocked term during the time period was "Trump," which was blocked 636,636 times, \uc2 CNN\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Some digital publishers said the push for brand safety amounts to indirect censorship. \uc2 Vice Media\uc2  told advertisers at a presentation in May that it will no longer allow brands to block 25 words, including "bisexual," "gay," "HIV," "lesbian," "Latino," "Middle Eastern," "Jewish" and "Islamic."\par \par \uc2 "Bias should not be the collateral damage of our much-needed brand-safety efforts," said Cavel Khan, senior vice president of client partnerships for North America at the Brooklyn-based media company, at the event.\par \par \uc2 Marketers became more aggressive about protecting their brands online after a 2017 article by the Times of London that carried the headline: "Big brands fund terror through online adverts." The article reported that ads from well-known brands were appearing on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  channels promoting hate speech or terrorism.\par \par \uc2 In the ensuing months, similar ad-placement problems plagued \uc2 YouTube\uc2  and other advertising platforms such as \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Advertisers began taking a more cautious approach to digital advertising, enlisting the help of firms specializing in "brand safety," ad buyers said.\par \par \uc2 "What turned out to be a reaction to protect a brand from unsafe things that are mostly user generated content," on sites such as \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , ended up hurting media companies focused on producing real journalism, said Christine Cook, senior vice president and chief revenue officer of CNN's digital operations.\par \par \uc2 In automated ad buying, brands aim their ads not at specific websites, but at audiences with certain characteristics -- people with certain shopping or web browsing histories, for example. Their ads are matched in real time to available inventory in online ad marketplaces that can come from thousands of websites. That is why brands sometimes are surprised to find their ads on websites they wouldn't have chosen.\par \par \uc2 Ad-tech firms specializing in brand safety offer advertisers multiple ways to control their ad placements. Advertisers can block entire categories -- "politics" or "violence," say -- using classifications set up by brand-safety firms. They can avoid certain keywords that appear in an article or headline. And they can establish a blacklist of sites to avoid or a white-list of sites they deem safe.\par \par \uc2 Brand safety has become a big business on Madison Avenue. Some agencies have hired teams of people to monitor digital ad placements, and some marketers have hired brand-safety officers.\par \par \uc2 Ad-technology firm OpenSlate said so many companies have asked for help avoiding news and political content on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  that it developed an algorithm last year to identify channels focusing those areas. Mike Henry, OpenSlate's chief executive officer, said about one-third of its top 100 clients are currently avoiding news and politics on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some ad-sales executives said the technology used for brand safety is too blunt because it doesn't take into account the full context of how specific words are used in a news story or video. CNN.com and Gannett are creating technology intended to give advertisers a better way to assess a news story.\par \par \uc2 CNN.com said it is testing a new product dubbed SAM, for Sentiment Analysis Moderator, that uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to score its site's content for whether it will make readers feel "mostly negative," "somewhat negative," "neutral," "somewhat positive" or "mostly positive."\par \par \uc2 CNN\uc2  tested the system by having it score 70,000 videos and articles, then having human editors review the content to see whether the technology worked. The company is testing the system with some advertisers who want to buy ads based on sentiment.\par \par \uc2 Allison Murphy, senior vice president for ad innovation at New York Times Co., said the company now offers several different ad-targeting options. "We can satisfy a brand that is fine with politics but doesn't want to be around President Trump," she said.\par \par \uc2 In May, representatives of several companies, including CNN.com, \uc2 USA Today\uc2  and the Journal met to discuss how they could work with ad agencies and measurement companies to devise a way to move the sector beyond keyword blacklists, according to people familiar with the meetings.\par \par \uc2 The "overreliance on long keyword blacklists has a real cost" to both publishers and brands, said \uc2 Josh Stinchcomb\uc2 , global chief revenue officer of the Journal and Barron's, both owned by \uc2 News Corp\uc2 . "To that end, we are building proprietary tools that ensure brand safety."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  also is using new technologies that help advertisers gauge the context of stories.\par \par \uc2 Some news publishers, including CNN.com and \uc2 USA Today\uc2 , are producing and promoting more ad-friendly lifestyle, technology, business and sports content.\par \par \uc2 "If a client says to us, 'We are just really not comfortable with news,' unlike some of our competitors, we don't have to say, 'Let me talk to you about why you should run in news,'" said \uc2 Michael Kuntz\uc2 , chief operating officer of national sales at USA Today Network, which includes \uc2 USA Today\uc2  and more than 100 local news outlets.\par \par \uc2 Still, he said, "the future of the digital news space is heavily reliant on us continuing to change the perception around why news does not need to be a polarizing category."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey A.

These include companies such as HealthReveal Inc., which uses AI to help physicians provide optimal care. Boston-based Buoy instead focuses on consumers, health insurers and self-insured businesses and aims to serve as an AI-powered front door into the medical system.\par \par \uc2 Common aches and pains cause many people reflexively to go to the emergency room. Individuals can plug symptoms into Buoy's website and learn more about when they should seek medical care and the type of care they need.\par \par \uc2 For example, according to Buoy co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Le, people frequently go to the emergency room because of abdominal pain. Buoy's system can lend insight into whether that pain is a concern or likely just constipation, Dr. Le said.\par \par \uc2 Buoy doesn't charge consumers, but it does sell its services to health insurers and businesses looking to improve health outcomes for their members or employees. Buoy's system also can help plan members or employees determine where to seek medical services that are covered by their insurance, Dr. Le said.\par \par \uc2 Buoy serves as a personal guide to the health-care system but doesn't render diagnoses or deliver medical care. It can, however, enable a handoff to medical care, according to Dr. Le. It could, for example, identify a telemedicine provider covered under a person's insurance and point the person to that service.\par \par \uc2 Buoy raised this Series B financing from Hambrecht Ducera Growth Ventures, which led the round, and F-Prime Capital Partners, \uc2 Humana Inc\uc2 . and Optum Ventures. It previously disclosed a $6.7 million Series A round in August 2017.\par \par \uc2 Write to Brian Gormley at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:brian.gormley@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2
