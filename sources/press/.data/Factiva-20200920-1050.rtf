SoftBank led a funding round valuing OneConnect at $7.5bn last year, according to Ping An\u8217\'20\'19s 2018 annual report.\par \par \uc2 Ping An declined to comment on the IPO. The offering is being led by \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and Ping An of \uc2 China Securities\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A large financial conglomerate with a background in insurance, banking and trust businesses, Ping An has in the past few years launched dozens of start-ups focused on areas such as medical care, financial technology, online car sales and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SoftBank has invested in many of its businesses, including Ping An Good Doctor. The online healthcare start-up raised $1.1bn in its IPO in Hong Kong in May last year, but had largely traded below its issue price until last month.\par \par \uc2 OneConnect, another one of the conglomerate\u8217\'20\'19s start-ups, began as an internal unit that developed fintech for the company. Now it has an outward facing business, for instance selling technology platforms to smaller banks and other services such as providing credit checks.\par \par \uc2 The company had an operating loss of $156m in the nine months ended September 30, the filing shows.\par \par \uc2 OneConnect said its customer base includes all of China\u8217\'20\'19s big banks and nearly half of the country\u8217\'20\'19s insurance groups, with 3,700 customers in total.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThrough our platform, in the nine months ended September 30, on a daily basis we facilitated over 135,000 anti-fraud checks, 4.2m credit risk assessments, and the processing of approximately 13,000 auto insurance claims,\u8221\'20\'1D it said.\par \par \uc2 OneConnect plans to use the proceeds to continue its international expansion, after establishing subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 In Hong Kong, it is set to develop the \uc2 Hong Kong Monetary Authority\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s eTradeConnect platform, a large-scale interbank blockchain trade finance platform, which serves 13 big banks. Alongside Ping An, it will invest further in AI, blockchain and cloud computing.\par \par \uc2 Despite trade tensions between the US and China, and a deepening tech war between the two economies, Chinese companies have continued to seek listings in New York.\par \par \uc2 At least nine Chinese companies filed for an IPO in October, including Canaan Creative, one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest makers of bitcoin mining materials, dronemaker EHang Holdings and real estate marketplace FangDD.\par \par \uc2 But OneConnect\u8217\'20\'19s US listing also comes as a number of big Chinese tech champions are choosing Hong Kong to list.\par \par \uc2 Alibaba this week filed with the Hong Kong exchange to raise up to $13.4bn in a secondary listing while ByteDance, which owns viral video app TikTok, is one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest unlisted start-ups and is considering a listing in the city next year.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191114efbe001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Building that element of the software was previously one of the startup's biggest challenges and was a key area of investment, Mr. Baker said.\par \par \uc2 With that challenge mostly behind the company, the new capital will primarily be used to bolster the startup's Austin, Texas, office's go-to-market team, Mr. Baker said.\par \par \uc2 Existing investors Bienville Capital, 8VC and \uc2 Menlo Ventures\uc2  also participated in new round.\par \par \uc2 Write to Marc Vartabedian at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:marc.vartabedian@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 marc.vartabedian@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20191113efbd0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

He will then select a basket of stocks to back from the strong performers and a basket of stocks to bet against from the laggards.\par \par \uc2 The launch of Atlas, which has not previously been reported, is among the first examples of a hedge fund focused solely on responsible investing, and comes as some of the biggest names in the industry turn to the environmental, social and governance sector in search of returns.\par \par \uc2 Caxton Associates\uc2 , one of the oldest hedge funds, in July told investors that "ESG is now centre stage for us in active investment decision-making in several areas".\par \par \uc2 Man Group\uc2 , the biggest listed hedge fund firm, says it has discovered a "factor" that can identify stocks with strong or improving ESG characteristics likely to beat the market.\par \par \uc2 However, Atlas's launch comes at a tough time for start-ups, with investors on track to pull money from the $3.2tn hedge fund industry for the third calendar year of the past four.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 400 hedge funds pulled down their shutters in the first half of this year, compared with 289 launches, according to data group HFR.\par \par \uc2 That closure-to-launch ratio is running near its highest level since the depths of the credit crisis in 2008.\par \par \uc2 A few new funds are attracting investor capital, however. Earlier this month the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  revealed that Michele Gesualdi, former chief investment officer at Kairos Investment Management, had raised more than $1bn for an alternative investments firm.\par \par \uc2 Mr Dumortier's fund will use California-based data firm Truevalue Labs to rank stocks based on their ESG characteristics and use \b \highlight22\uc2 natural language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2  to read press articles and company filings to gauge whether firms are starting to perform better or worse in these areas.\par \par \uc2 A panel of industry experts will sift through the stocks before Mr Dumortier selects his long and short portfolios.\par \par \uc2 The former captain in the French special forces was at Edoma before launching Atlas Global\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020191113efbd0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

We will also need to maintain full participation in European funding schemes and the collaboration that they promote, rather than trying to replace them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Johnson also pledged \u163\'00\'A31.8bn to rebuild further education colleges over the next five years.\par \par \uc2 Further education colleges welcomed the spending. \uc2 David Hughes\uc2 , chief executive of the Association of Colleges, called the \u8220\'20\'1Clong overdue\u8221\'20\'1D investment \u8220\'20\'1Cgreat news for the 2.2m people who study and train in colleges every year and who deserve the best facilities\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Peggy Hollinger and Clive Cookson\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191113efbd007ep\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

This week we launch a new section called \u8220\'20\'1CArt of the Deal\u8221\'20\'1D, which will track the big venture capital and private equity deals. Indian company Paytm\u8217\'20\'19s investment plans gets under way. Separately, check out the \uc2 Fitbit\uc2  for cows, Mongolia\u8217\'20\'19s start-up scene and XPeng, the Chinese electric car company that is bucking a trend.\par \par \uc2 The Big Story\par \par \uc2 Asia\u8217\'20\'19s most valuable company, Alibaba, is seeking to raise a lot more money. A secondary listing in Hong Kong could raise up to $15bn, sources told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 . Ostensibly, a company worth $486bn with $33bn in cash and equivalents does not appear to need the extra dosh.\par \par \uc2 So what will it do with its bulging wallet?\par \par \uc2 Key implications: Sources told the Nikkei Asian Review that Alibaba may invest some of the proceeds in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  projects or in acquisitions in areas such as food delivery and travel.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The other striking characteristic of Alibaba in recent years has been its expansion into the rest of Asia. One aspect of this is the Touch \u8217\'20\'19n Go payments app in Malaysia, a joint venture between Alibaba\u8217\'20\'19s affiliate Ant Financial and Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s CIMB. It has emerged as the market leader, beating out competition from Grab, the Singapore-based start-up.\par \par \uc2 Other ventures in Asia include \uc2 Zomato\uc2  in India, which has ambitious expansion plans (see Heard by Henny). Also in India, Paytm (see Art of the Deal below) is seeking to raise more funds. Several other affiliates in South Korea, Indonesia, Philippines, Bangladesh, Thailand and elsewhere give Alibaba an unrivalled consumer tech network across the region.\par \par \uc2 Upshot: It is not yet clear what Alibaba will do with the money that it raises in its planned Hong Kong share issue. But its growing presence in the region can only be enhanced by the extra investment dollars.\par \par \uc2 Mercedes\u8217\'20\'19 top 10\par \par \uc2 A round-up of the week\u8217\'20\'19s best tech stories from the FT\u8217\'20\'19s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Visitors to China can now access Alipay and \uc2 WeChat\uc2  Pay without having a Chinese bank account. It\u8217\'20\'19s hard to overstate what a game-changer this is in terms of foreigners and tourists gaining access to China\u8217\'20\'19s cashless economy.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Visa\uc2  is in discussions with south-east Asian tech unicorn Gojek to bring out a \u8220\'20\'1Cpay later service\u8221\'20\'1D to the platform. The world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest payments network participated in a funding round by the Indonesia-based start-up this year.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s a \uc2 Fitbit\uc2  for cows. India, the world\u8217\'20\'19s number one milk market, has an unproductive cow problem and start-up Stellapps is hoping its devices can fix it.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Alibaba Singles\u8217\'20\'19 Day headlines brought us a number of eye-popping sales numbers (again). The FT\u8217\'20\'19s Ryan McMorrow analyses the challenge that comes with that: logistics. The Chinese company is also very sensitive about anyone questioning its sales figures, like this man did.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 It was a grim debut for 36Kr, the Chinese news and data website that listed on the Nasdaq last week. Shares were priced at $14.50 and are now down nearly 40 per cent.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 The WeWork knock-on effect is hitting another SoftBank-backed company in Asia: India\u8217\'20\'19s Oyo. The discount hotel chain is scaling back revenue guarantees aimed at persuading hotel owners to sign up to its platform, and has cancelled some existing agreements. Read the Nikkei Asian Review scoop here.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  once wanted to buy the Chinese company that formed the basis of video app TikTok. Now it has become a \u8220\'20\'1Cconvenient bogeyman to the \u8216\'20\'18privacy-focused\u8217\'20\'19, America-first narrative championed by the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  founder\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Here\u8217\'20\'19s a great piece in the Nikkei Asian Review on the unique role India\u8217\'20\'19s enterprising women are playing in fuelling the country\u8217\'20\'19s internet revolution \u8212\'20\'14 especially in ecommerce.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Can Mongolia\u8217\'20\'19s growing IT sector keep the economy humming during severe winters? The country\u8217\'20\'19s high smartphone penetration (1.4 per person) is fertile ground for start-ups.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 In the internet age, even emojis are big business. John Thornhill digs into how our \u8220\'20\'1Ctears of joy\u8221\'20\'1D are subject to corporate lobbying, civic campaigning and geopolitical bullying. Who should be in charge of responding to the evolving demands?\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 When sages speak\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 This is a fascinating report by Jonathan Hillman and Maesea McCalpin from CSIS on the \u8220\'20\'1Csafe city\u8221\'20\'1D technology that \uc2 Huawei\uc2  is selling around the world. The facial recognition, licence plate recognition, social media monitoring and other surveillance capabilities it sells are generally being bought by authoritarian countries, raising the charge that \uc2 Huawei\uc2  is helping to \u8220\'20\'1Cexport authoritarianism\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Elsa B Kania sounds the alarm in this report on how the US risks losing \u8220\'20\'1Ca critical competitive advantage\u8221\'20\'1D in 5G telecoms. \u8220\'20\'1CToday, China seems poised to become a global leader and first mover in 5G,\u8221\'20\'1D she writes. \u8220\'20\'1CThe \uc2 US government\uc2  has yet to commit any funding or national initiatives in 5G that are close to comparable in scope and scale to those of China.\u8221\'20\'1D You could call this a \u8220\'20\'1Cnew Sputnik moment\u8221\'20\'1D, but for the apparent lack of US concern.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 The guys at Macro Polo, who we often feature in TSA, have done an excellent deep dive into organic light-emitting diode\u160\'00\'A0(OLED) screens and lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technologies. By 2022, OLED production is projected to be almost 25 times greater than what it was in 2012. Li-ion battery demand, meanwhile, is set to grow from 26GWh in 2015 to 54GWh in 2025 as demand from smartphones, laptops and other digital devices grows.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Heard by Henny\par \par \uc2 Just a few years ago, there was almost no online food delivery in India. But today \uc2 Zomato\uc2  has 200,000 people bringing food to middle class consumers in 500 cities across the country. In 18 months, it hopes to double that number, its co-founder \uc2 Gaurav Gupta\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Its average delivery person receives Rs22,000 ($305) a month gross or between Rs15,000 and Rs18,000 in take-home pay, depending on whether they travel by push bike or motorbike. If you add the number of people working for \uc2 Zomato\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s great rival Swiggy for ride-hailing services including Ola and Uber, and the army of those delivering parcels ordered from \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and \uc2 Flipkart\uc2 , the grand total might reach 1.5m, according to estimates from McKinsey\u8217\'20\'19s Mumbai office.\par \par \uc2 But is the uplift from the tech boom in India powerful enough to carry the broader economy? While it no doubt helps, the tech advance falls far short of presenting an answer to India\u8217\'20\'19s slowing economy. Gross domestic product growth is hovering at about 5 per cent a year \u8212\'20\'14 far less than the level required to absorb about 1m people joining the workforce every month.\par \par \uc2 Read the story\u160\'00\'A0 here by Henny Sender, the FT\u8217\'20\'19s chief correspondent, international finance.\par \par \uc2 Art of the deal\par \par \uc2 Digital payments in India are one of the most compelling tech trends in Asia. India is also one of the most competitive markets anywhere, with SoftBank, Alibaba, \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway\uc2 , Tencent, \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , Xiaomi and others all backing local businesses against the likes of \uc2 PayPal\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2  Pay and others.\par \par \uc2 Paytm, which is backed by Alibaba, Berkshire and SoftBank, is the market leader with nearly 130m monthly active users and 450m registered users. It is reportedly looking to raise $2bn in a new financing round, said Deal Street Asia.\par \par \uc2 Paytm, which ranks as India\u8217\'20\'19s most valuable unicorn, is also planning to increase its investments in early-stage start-ups, earmarking $70m for this purpose. One of its focuses will be \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -based businesses and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere:\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Tencent has acquired a stake in India\u8217\'20\'19s PolicyBazaar, India\u8217\'20\'19s largest insurance aggregator. The deal may have been worth about $150m. It marks Tencent\u8217\'20\'19s first entry into India\u8217\'20\'19s underserved insurance sector and complements its recent investment into NiYo, a start-up that helps the country\u8217\'20\'19s blue-collar workers manage their finances.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 In other deals-related activity, Beijing-based private equity firm Primavera Capital Group has raised $3.4bn for what is the second-largest China-focused fund raised by a local manager. It\u8217\'20\'19s been a busy week for Tencent, which is also leading a $400m fundraising in Chinese online car services platform Tuhu.\par \par \uc2 In the spotlight\par \par \uc2 He Xiaopeng\u8217\'20\'19s given name means \u8220\'20\'1Clittle friend\u8221\'20\'1D. And the chief executive of Chinese electric vehicle start-up XPeng has needed friends of late.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The country\u8217\'20\'19s new energy vehicle market has struggled this year, with sales falling 46 per cent year on year in October alone (see below). But investors in XPeng have kept the faith, agreeing to back the company to the tune of an extra $400m, XPeng announced.\par \par \uc2 Alibaba is already an investor in XPeng but the latest financing round also brings in Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. The money raised will be used for research and development on autonomous driving software and mass production of XPeng\u8217\'20\'19s G3 sport utility model and P7 sedan.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Smart data\par \par \uc2 Why are new energy vehicle sales falling in China? The 46 per cent year-on-year drop in electric vehicle sales in October has prompted some to wonder if it is all over for a market that was thought to hold enormous promise.\par \par \uc2 But the reasons for the slowdown reveal a different narrative. Chinese consumers are fighting shy of buying electric vehicles because their second hand value is so poor. A three-year-old BYD e6 is worth about 30 per cent of its sales price when new \u8212\'20\'14 much lower than the equivalent for a gasoline car.\par \par \uc2 The reason for this, in turn, is that battery technology in China is on the march. Chinese battery makers, such as CATL, are set to bring out batteries that are cheaper, longer lasting and quicker to charge as soon as next year. Car buyers are holding off for a better deal.\par \par \uc2 Regulation round-up\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Show me the money. Singapore\u8217\'20\'19s central bank will probably extend its funding for fintech initiatives, citing huge \u8220\'20\'1Csuccess\u8221\'20\'1D in boosting competitiveness and innovation. There are now more than 600 fintech start-ups in Singapore, up from about 50 in 2015, according to the \uc2 Monetary Authority of Singapore\uc2 . The new funding plans could extend to cyber security and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , MAS said.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Vietnam is taking a leaf out of Indonesia\u8217\'20\'19s book and restricting foreign ownership on payments companies. The country\u8217\'20\'19s central bank is proposing a 49 per cent cap on foreign ownership. For context the five largest e-payment companies in the country, which account for 90 per cent of the market, are owned anywhere between 30 per cent and 90 per cent by overseas investors. But if the law is approved it will not be implemented retroactively, which may temper some opposition.\par \par \uc2 We always want to hear your thoughts and feedback, so please drop us an email at techscrollasia@ft.com.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191113efbd003bi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

By cross-referencing those summaries with data that must be filed by law to the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , the researchers found that many funds told \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  they held more triple-A and double-A bonds than they actually did.\par \par \uc2 That misreporting ultimately leads investors to put money into misclassified funds, the researchers said. By their estimate, about 30 per cent of high- and medium-credit quality funds were given a less risky profile in recent years than they should have received.\par \par \uc2 A Morningstar spokesperson said the researchers had "misunderstood" the company's "proprietary methodologies" and used some of its data incorrectly to make "sweeping conclusions". The Chicago-based company is considered the de facto data provider for many financial advisers and retail investors in the US, scoring hundreds of fixed-income funds according to its proprietary star rating system, which blends backward-looking assessments of risk-adjusted performance, cost and other measures. Other academic work has found links between those ratings and investor behaviour, noting big inflows in the wake of upgrades and outflows after downgrades. Assets under management in bond funds came to a record $9.4tn at the end of June this year, double the level of 2010, as the spread of negative interest rates across fixed-income markets drove up the value of the bond market globally.\par \par \uc2 "People perceive the star ratings as some kind of endorsement," said Samuel Lee, a financial adviser and former strategist for \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 . He added that by relying on self-reported data, the company "opens itself up to manipulation" by fund managers, which pay \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  for its services.\par \par \uc2 "Fund companies are going to play the game," he said. "It's rational behaviour on their part."\par \par \uc2 In the paper, the academics argue that although \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  has access to the SEC data on funds' holdings, it chooses to focus on the self-reported summaries, where misreporting of risk is "persistent, widespread, and appears strategic".\par \par \uc2 Misclassifications are "overwhelmingly one-sided", the paper argued. "One per cent of all misstatements push funds down a category 99 per cent of misstatements push up to a safer category."\par \par \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  added: "We stand by the accuracy of our data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and we are reaching out to the authors with an offer to help understand the data they used and to clarify the ... methodologies we employ."\par \par \uc2 'Fund companies are going to play the game.

The venture-capital industry has long been known for lacking diversity. That can make fundraising an uphill battle for some founders of color, according to Precursor Ventures.\par \par \uc2 To help address this, the San Francisco seed-stage firm created a list of venture firms and angel investors that have invested in at least two early-stage startups led by underrepresented minorities. Precursor limited its list to seed or Series A rounds since 2018 and firms with more than $5 million in assets under management.\par \par \uc2 The list of more than 60 firms includes some well-known names such as \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , Sequoia Capital and \uc2 True Ventures\uc2  but also smaller or lesser-known firms such as Better Ventures, Harlem Capital Partners and Trail Mix Ventures. Precursor hopes the list will help founders find more places to pitch, and cause venture firms to be more open to providing data.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Saving the Vision Fund. \uc2 Rajeev Misra\uc2 , who put together \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 .'s $100 billion Vision Fund, is now in charge of keeping it from falling apart, The Wall Street Journal reports. A finance whiz who cut his teeth on Wall Street, Mr. Misra pads around the Vision Fund's London headquarters barefoot, often chewing on betel nuts, a mild stimulant. The past month has taken him to New York, where he arranged the financing for the WeWork rescue, and to the Middle East, where he tried to allay the concerns of the fund's two largest investors, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.\par \par \uc2 WeWork metric. Just weeks before WeWork expected its stock to begin trading publicly, the startup was still wrangling with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  over a controversial key financial metric and a litany of other concerns about its planned multibillion-dollar IPO, The Wall Street Journal reports.\par \par \uc2 * Related: As WeWork Grew, Wall Street Lent It Money and Credibility\par \par \uc2 Controls on tech exports. The Commerce Department faces criticism for a delay in implementing a 2018 law, which some fear gives China a window to buy military items. Congress passed a law last year that called for tougher restrictions on the types of cutting-edge technology U.S. companies can sell abroad. The Commerce Department has yet to write the wording that would implement the new rules.\par \par \uc2 Quantum leap.

European Investment Fund and Institui\u231\'00\'E7\u227\'00\'E3o Financeira de Desenvolvimento have each committed \u8364\'20\'AC7.5 million ($8.3 million) toward Faber Tech II, which will invest in early-stage data-centric startups, mostly in Portugal.\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 He thought his phone was secure; then he lost $24 million to hackers. The man was a victim of SIM swapping, a relatively new attack where criminals steal a person's phone number and use it to gain access to accounts, The Wall Street Journal reports.\par \par \uc2 Game makers expect to ring in holidays with strong digital sales. Companies are adding new content and experiences to their blockbuster game franchises to keep players engaged.\par \par \uc2 Amazon's Fire TV to carry Disney+ streaming-video service. The companies had been in a dispute over terms for carrying \uc2 Disney\uc2  apps on Fire TV devices.\par \par \uc2 Square's cleanup still leaves questions.

A week ago, the firm closed its second and latest fund, BP Natural Gas Opportunity Partners II LP, on $348 million of commitments, only 0.6% shy of the pool's $350 million target, said Loren Soetenga, who oversees investor relations for the Dallas-based private-equity firm.\par \par \uc2 Loan Investor Owl Rock Sells 20% Stake to Dyal to Fund Expansion\par \par \uc2 Owl Rock Capital Group, one of the fastest-growing firms in one of Wall Street's fastest-growing sectors, is about to get even bigger. The private-lending business started in 2016 has sold a 20% stake to Dyal Capital Partners to help launch a new investment vehicle Owl Rock hopes to grow to $3 billion to $5 billion. Dyal paid about $500 million for the stake, implying a valuation of at least $2.5 billion for the firm, people familiar with the matter said.

The deal, which was announced Friday and previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, values dating-site parent company MagicLab at about $3 billion, Blackstone said. As part of the deal, Andrey Andreev, the founder and chief executive of MagicLab, will sell his stake in the company to Blackstone and step down from his role. Thirty-year-old Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd will retain the vast majority of her stake and will become CEO of the company.\par \par \uc2 Cumming's Take: Private-Equity Investors Want Fundraising Hamster Wheel to Slow\par \par \uc2 By Chris Cumming\par \par \uc2 Private-equity investors are wearying of large, established managers raising new funds at ever shorter intervals, a new survey shows. In private equity, the fundraising cycle has perhaps never been as short as it is now. The average time between a private-equity firm's fund closings has tightened, reaching about 42 months last year, more than 10 months fewer than in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 $8.5 Trillion\par \par \uc2 The total wealth of the world's billionaires last year, down about $388 billion, or 4.4%, from 2017, according to UBS Group AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.\par \par \uc2 Deals\par \par \uc2 TriArtisan Capital Advisors has agreed to sell a majority stake in \uc2 TGI Fridays\uc2  restaurant owner TGIF Group to blank-check company \uc2 Allegro Merger Corp\uc2 . that will lead to a public listing for the multinational casual dining chain. The transaction will give TriArtisan $30 million in cash and stock and allow it to transfer about $350 million in debt to the special-purpose acquisition company. More than half of Fridays approximately 840 restaurants are located outside the U.S. The group had trailing 12-month sales of about $2 billion. Allegro was formed in August 2017 and is led by Eric Rosenfeld as chief executive, according to a regulatory filing. He has led five previous transactions involving blank-check companies.\par \par \uc2 Greenridge Investment Partners has acquired cloud-based association management software provider GrowthZone, investing alongside management of the Nisswa, Minn.-based company. With the investment, Greenridge's Jack Cardwell and Ben Moss have joined the GrowthZone board.\par \par \uc2 Oak HC/FT has invested $20 million in secure identification technology provider ABC Technologies BV. Oak HC/FT is a growth-equity fund based in Greenwich, Conn., with $1.9 billion under management. ABC, a subsidiary of \uc2 ICTS International NV\uc2 , is the holding company for AU10TIX Ltd., which specializes in hardware and software used to authenticate and digitize passports, driver's licenses and other IDs.\par \par \uc2 Starwood Energy Group Global\uc2  has agreed to acquire the gas-gathering business of Third Coast Midstream LLC. The operations are in and around Lavaca County, Texas. The operation includes more than 260 miles of pipeline and related infrastructure in the Eagle Ford shale region.\par \par \uc2 Gemspring Capital\uc2  has invested in Crafty Apes LLC, a visual effects company based in Los Angeles. Crafty Apes' services range from 2-D and 3-D compositing to digital cosmetics and computer-generated imagery. Founded in 2011, the company's recent credits include "La La Land," "Stranger Things," "Hidden Figures" and "Ant-Man and the Wasp."\par \par \uc2 Butterfly Equity has acquired a majority interest in Orgain Inc., with the \uc2 Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan\uc2  investing alongside as a minority partner. Irvine, Calif.-based Orgain produces organic and clean nutrition products including protein powders, shakes and bars.

The fair value of its private-equity investments generated a gross return of 4% in the quarter. The investment manager said comparisons shouldn't be made with year-earlier results because of a change in its reporting practices. Onex said it received $775 million from its private-equity investments in the first nine months of the year, largely driven by the sale of Jack's Family Restaurants and the secondary sales of \uc2 SIG Combibloc Group AG\uc2  and \uc2 Clarivate \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  PLC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For the second time this year, Lime Rock Partners-backed natural gas producer Arsenal Energy Holdings LLC has filed for bankruptcy, blaming falling prices, tightening lending standards and high transportation costs. The company filed for chapter 11 protection Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., with a prepackaged restructuring agreement backed by all major lenders. Natural gas prices have cratered over the past year, an aftereffect of the industry's rapid growth in the U.S., and a supply glut has hammered shares of Appalachian producers.\par \par \uc2 Some pension-fund managers are venturing further into unusual investment territory as this year's plunge in bond yields makes it harder to find decent long-term returns. Funds are dabbling in riskier asset classes, including private markets, real-estate projects, infrastructure financing and direct lending. Some are making riskier fixed-income bets, buying volatile assets such as 100-year Argentine government bonds. Others are going farther afield, investing in greenhouses and waste management.\par \par \uc2 Rajeev Misra\uc2 , who put together \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 .'s $100 billion Vision Fund, is now in charge of keeping it from falling apart, The Wall Street Journal reports. A finance whiz who cut his teeth on Wall Street, Mr. Misra pads around the Vision Fund's London headquarters barefoot, often chewing on betel nuts, a mild stimulant. He recently changed the layout of his office after consulting his astrologer.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20191111efbb0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All funds within this section, whether OEICs or unit trusts are authorised in the UK by the Financial Services Authority. The prices quoted should only be used as a guide.\par \par \uc2 OEIC: Open-Ended Investment Company. Similar to a unit trust but using a company rather than a trust structure.\par \par \uc2 Share Classes: Separate classes of share are denoted by a letter or number after the name of the fund. Different classes are issued to reflect a different currency, charging structure or type of holder. Buying price: Also called offer price. The price at which units in a unit trust are bought by investors. Includes manager's initial charge. Selling price: Also called bid price. The price at which units in a unit trust are sold by investors.\par \par \uc2 Single price: Based on a mid-market valuation of the underlying investments. The buying and selling price for shares of an OEIC and units of a single priced unit trust are the same. Exit Charges: The letter E denotes that an exit charge may be made when you sell units, contact the manager/operator for full details. Time: The time shown alongside the fund manager's/operator's name is the time of the unit trust's/OEIC's valuation point unless another time is indicated by the symbol alongside the individual unit trust/OEIC name. The symbols are as follows: \u166\'00\'A6 0001 to 1100 hours; ? 1101 to 1400 hours; ?1401 to 1700 hours; # 1701 to midnight. Daily dealing prices are set on the basis of the valuation point, a short period of time may elapse before prices become available.\par \par \uc2 Yield: Funds comprising mainly of bonds normally quote a gross redemption yield after all charges but before tax has been deducted. Funds mainly made up of equities normally quote a yield representing the estimated annual payout net of tax for basic rate taxpayer. For further information contact the management company.\par \par \uc2 Historic pricing: The letter H denotes that the managers/operators will normally deal on the price set at the most recent valuation. The prices shown are the latest available before publication and may not be the current dealing levels because of an intervening portfolio revaluation or a switch to a forward pricing basis. The managers/operators must deal at a forward price on request, and may move to forward pricing at any time. Forward pricing: The letter F denotes that that managers/operators deal at the price to be set at the next valuation. Investors can be given no definite price in advance of the purchase or sale being carried out. The prices appearing in the newspaper are the most recent provided by the managers/operators.

His eight-year term expires on December 31.\par \par \uc2 The Basel-based BIS, owned by 60 central banks, will unveil its initiative to tackle private sector monetary and payment innovations. The Innovation Hub will have unprecedented power to add to the stock of public monetary goods.\par \par \uc2 The first task facing Mr C\u339\'01\'53ur\u233\'00\'E9, who starts in January and will serve a five-year term, will be to co-operate with the \uc2 Swiss National Bank\uc2  to create a central bank digital currency for wholesale use between banks, safeguarded by so-called distributed ledger technology (DLT).\par \par \uc2 BIS officials believe central banks should pool their resources to fend off potentially disruptive competition from much better funded private sector competitors.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Libra project, which has lost seven of its founding partners since its announcement in June, is feared to lock users in publicly unaccountable walled-gardens. Though questions remain over the project\u8217\'20\'19s future as it prepares to launch in 2020, the growing popularity of privately issued and internationally distributed stablecoins has prompted the BIS to take action on a joint approach.\par \par \uc2 Stablecoins, which draw their stability from the fiat-denominated collateral that backs them, are often distributed across DLT or cryptocurrency blockchain systems.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re not just here to make money, we\u8217\'20\'19re here to make sure we serve the public interest, a global public interest,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Hyun Song Shin\uc2 , BIS economic adviser and acting hub head. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a role that needs to be done. And it\u8217\'20\'19s the right moment because we\u8217\'20\'19re on the cusp of a huge leap.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The announcement this summer of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Libra project sparked global consternation in public policy circles owing to fears it could undermine monetary sovereignty and introduce new money laundering risks into the global financial system.\par \par \uc2 This has increased pressure on central banks to offer a co-ordinated alternative solution to the sort of payment frictions Libra aims to combat and which fintech specialists say can no longer be ignored.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFrom 2017 on, developments have been very fast. The hype about bitcoin brought to the fore a lot of forces in the market and society,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Agust\u237\'00\'EDn Carstens\uc2  general manager of the BIS.\par \par \uc2 With the new hub, the BIS is hoping to strike a balance between the private and public sector on the firm belief that some public goods ought to be provided by public bodies but that other features, such as those focused on customer service and usability, are better provided to the market by private players.\par \par \uc2 In Hong Kong, the hub will work with local monetary authorities on ventures to solve supply chain problems. And in Singapore, it will look to apply its resources to so-called \u8220\'20\'1Csuptech\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 regulation and supervision innovation \u8212\'20\'14 utilising \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn some cases the problem is not technological, so why try to force a technology solution where things are working? We need to be smarter about where we devote our resources,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Carstens. \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t want to sacrifice what we have that works well.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The rollout of further international centres in the Americas and Europe is expected in the hub\u8217\'20\'19s secondary phase.\par \par \uc2 During his testimony to Congress last month, \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , chief executive of Facebook, warned legislators that the creation of an international digital currency was \u8220\'20\'1Ctoo important for any single company to undertake on its own\u8221\'20\'1D and that if the US did not innovate its financial leadership could not be guaranteed as China was moving much more quickly.\par \par \uc2 Thus far, central banks have mostly been experimenting independently on DLT and fintech projects.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191111efbb001e2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

No branches, no fuss.\par \par \uc2 So it was jarring when Chime, the largest US challenger bank, left 5m customers without access to their accounts last month. The service outage lasted roughly two days beginning on October 16, after users began complaining about declined payments.\par \par \uc2 Chime\u8217\'20\'19s rapid growth and recent stumbles were popular topics at private dinners and hallway meetings during the recent Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, taking place less than two weeks after the outage. Some attendees said that Chime was an example of fintechs pursuing growth-at-all-cost strategies while neglecting basic business functions.\par \par \uc2 But Chime\u8217\'20\'19s setback also turned the spotlight on its payments partner Galileo, and similar start-ups that connect consumer-facing apps to credit card processors and other parts of the financial system.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Varo, another US challenger bank customer that uses Galileo, also experienced outages around the same time as Chime.\par \par \uc2 In an interview at Money 20/20, Chime chief executive Chris Britt said the company\u8217\'20\'19s troubles began after Galileo experienced database issues affecting card authorisation functions. Mr Britt said Chime \u8220\'20\'1Cintentionally\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09reduced the functionality in the app\u8221\'20\'1D to \u8220\'20\'1Climit the amount of stress\u8221\'20\'1D on Galileo and help restore card purchases, causing the extended service lapses.\par \par \uc2 Mr Britt said Chime planned to stay with Galileo despite the outage and called the company \u8220\'20\'1Cone of the premiere processing systems\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf anything it\u8217\'20\'19s brought us closer together and allowed us to put in more rigorous processes for monitoring in partnership with them,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Britt said.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Galileo said it worked on \u8220\'20\'1Crestoring the most critical functions first\u8221\'20\'1D and that \u8220\'20\'1Cany outage is unacceptable to Galileo\u8217\'20\'19s commitment to quality\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMost companies \u8212\'20\'14 from airlines to large technology companies to large banks and fintechs \u8212\'20\'14 rely on service providers and as we have seen recently, outages are an unfortunate part of life in technology,\u8221\'20\'1D the company said.\par \par \uc2 News of Galileo\u8217\'20\'19s issues came at an awkward time. On the same day, it announced that \uc2 Accel Partners\uc2  had led a $77m funding round for the company\u8217\'20\'19s expansion into Latin America and Europe.\par \par \uc2 Beside Chime and Varo, Galileo serves many of the largest private fintech groups including Monzo, Revolut, Robinhood and \uc2 TransferWise\uc2 . The Utah-based company has said it is profitable and manages more than $26bn in payments annually.\par \par \uc2 Now, Galileo may be pressed to direct some of the new funding towards systems improvements, ensuring its plumbing doesn\u8217\'20\'19t falter as it expands into new territories.\par \par \uc2 Challenger banks raised a record haul of $2.5bn in 55 deals in the seven months to July, according to CB Insights data, ranking as the fastest-growing private fintech sector.\par \par \uc2 But many like Chime still rely on banking partners to hold customer deposits, and the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  has recently questioned the risk models underlying some digital challengers. In the same month as Chime\u8217\'20\'19s outage, the UK group Revolut also experienced an hours-long service disruption that the company said was due to \u8220\'20\'1Chuman error\u8221\'20\'1D on its own end.\par \par \uc2 Since the Chime outage, Mr Britt said that the company has worked on creating another \u8220\'20\'1Credundant data centre\u8221\'20\'1D with Galileo to alleviate the effects of any further lapses.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s the reality of the world of financial infrastructure,\u8221\'20\'1D said Richie Serna, chief executive of the payments company Finix. \u8220\'20\'1CAt scale, you\u8217\'20\'19re doing such a high volume and the margin for error is so small, so redundancy is such a critical part of everything we do.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Quick fire Q&A\par \par \uc2 Company name:\u160\'00\'A0Tradeteq\par \par \uc2 When founded:\u160\'00\'A02016\par \par \uc2 Where based:\u160\'00\'A0London\par \par \uc2 CEO:\u160\'00\'A0Christoph Gugelmann\par \par \uc2 What do you sell, and who do you sell it to:\u160\'00\'A0We operate an electronic trading platform for trade finance products.

The tech is on the dated side of payments innovation, but it still equates -- at least in theory -- to the current vogue for stablecoins.\par \par \uc2 For that\u8217\'20\'19s really all a stablecoin system is: any digital unit, issued to a specific network, backed by an underlying pool of high-quality collateral -- in this case, Swiss francs.\par \par \uc2 The functional, albeit slightly aged, luncheon system is an apt metaphor for the state of central banking innovation more broadly. These monetary guardians, once powerful and advanced, look increasingly dated and irrelevant when compared to competition from fintech.\par \par \uc2 The hope is that this is all set to change. In Beno\u238\'00\'EEt C\u339\'01\'53ur\u233\'00\'E9 the BIS has captured one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most intelligent and forward thinking officials. He will head the new Innovation Hub, set up to tackle tech giants\u8217\'20\'19 attempted power grab of the global monetary system.\par \par \uc2 Before we look at what happens next, we need to go back in time.\par \par \uc2 The BIS was founded nearly 90 years ago to manage reparations payments in the aftermath of World War One and with a mission to foster closer cooperation between the world\u8217\'20\'19s central banks.\par \par \uc2 The headquarters is a little younger dating back to the 1970s. But the Swiss lair remains replete with highly stylised cream-leather furnishings, shag-pile carpets and drop-down shell chandeliers, made by the Danish designer and architect Verner Panton. The perfect monument, then, to what the future must have looked like when Roger Moore was the man the world looked to to defend it from international criminal syndicates intent on global domination.\par \par \uc2 Today the greater threat, some might argue, comes from aspiring tech monopolists, obsessed with achieving global domination by capturing the international payments system instead.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s tempting to assume, as some already have, that the central bankers\u8217\'20\'19 Innovation Hub was put into action precisely to stamp out such megalomaniacal forces emanating from the tech arena.\par \par \uc2 The timing certainly fits.\par \par \uc2 The BIS said on June 30, just a week or so after \uc2 Facebook\uc2  revealed their Libra stablecoin plan, that its board had approved a hub \u8220\'20\'1Cto foster international collaboration on innovative financial technology within the central banking community complementing the already well established cooperation within the existing committees.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But FT Alphaville understands that the hub predates Libra. The idea originated around the beginning of 2019 after BIS officials realised over the course of 2018 that the rollout of stablecoins meant they could no longer afford to ignore developments in the fintech and cryptocurrency space or to appear complacent. Not least because of how fintech is increasingly seeking to replicate fiat systems by leveraging their stability -- but not necessarily the regulations that go with them.\par \par \uc2 "From 2017 on developments have been very fast. The hype about bitcoin brought to the fore a lot of forces in the market and society...\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Agust\u237\'00\'EDn Carstens\uc2 , general manager of the BIS.\par \par \uc2 Mr Carstens acknowledged that \uc2 Facebook\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s announcement had forced central banks to put their thinking caps on, especially in the wake of global consternation that the multilateral initiative could undermine monetary sovereignty and introduce money laundering risks into the global financial system. \u8220\'20\'1CThe surprise was that Libra was such a bold challenge to fiat currency. I think it was really bold. But that\u8217\'20\'19s also welcome, as it\u8217\'20\'19s forced us to regroup and to rethink and not to neglect the issue.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The key challenge facing the public sector remains mitigating the sort of payment frictions Libra aims to combat and which fintech specialists say can no longer be ignored. Those frictions are particularly prevalent in slow and expensive cross-border payments -- giving the BIS, as a global talking shop for central banks, an opportunity to lead the charge against private stablecoins.\par \par \uc2 The hub will welcome C\u339\'01\'53ur\u233\'00\'E9 as its new head from January 15 onwards, replacing \uc2 Hyun Song Shin\uc2  who is acting in the role in the interim. The appointment follows an eight-year term on the \uc2 ECB\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s executive board for the Frenchman during which time he will have gained just the right blend of central banking and payments experience to do the job.\par \par \uc2 Along with encouraging central bank coordination on financial innovation C\u339\'01\'53ur\u233\'00\'E9 will also be tasked with pooling central bank resources to better compete with the seemingly endless pockets of private sector challengers in the fintech space. A further objective of the hub will be to ensure the public stock of monetary goods is not displaced by private sector initiatives.\par \par \uc2 For the first time in its history, the BIS will also directly influence public policy instead of staying firmly on the backseat. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are rolling up our sleeves and making things that will add to the stock of public goods. This is the leap for us. We\u8217\'20\'19ve always observed, but now the second bit is going to be new,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Shin told FT Alphaville.\par \par \uc2 While it has been known for a while the BIS was planning an innovation hub, the details and priorities of the hub have thus far been vague. It was revealed over the summer that the hub would initially operate from Basel, Hong Kong and Singapore, under the auspices of the host central banks in question, and later rolled out to other centres in the Americas and Europe.\par \par \uc2 But now we know the hub\u8217\'20\'19s initial phase will see it cooperate with the \uc2 Swiss National Bank\uc2  on the creation of a wholesale central bank digital currency using distributed ledger technology (DLT) and further tokenisation of assets utilising R3\u8216\'20\'18s Corda technology platform.\par \par \uc2 In Hong Kong, meanwhile, the hub will work with local monetary authorities on ventures using DLT to solve supply chain problems. Finally, in Singapore, the hub will look to apply its resources to so-called \u8220\'20\'1Csuptech\u8221\'20\'1D -- regulation and supervision innovation -- utilising \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The rollout of further international centres in the Americas and Europe is expected in the hub\u8217\'20\'19s secondary phase.\par \par \uc2 With the hub, the BIS is hoping to strike a balance between the private and public sector on the firm belief that some public goods ought to be provided by public bodies but that other features, such as those focused on customer service and usability, are better provided to the market by private players.\par \par \uc2 "We should encourage the private sector to do what they do best, which is to serve customers,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Shin said. "Some public goods ought to be provided by the public sector. It doesn't mean we have to do everything, but we have to find the right dividing line between what the public sector does best and what the private sector does best."\par \par \uc2 Thus far, central bankers have been experimenting independently on DLT and fintech projects. In many cases, among them exploratory work by the \uc2 Bank of Canada\uc2  on DLT, experiments have failed to deliver on hyped up market claims while revealing no obvious advantage over standing technologies.\par \par \uc2 While it is often said the private sector likes to move fast and break things the BIS approach to financial disruption will put stability and security at the forefront.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn some cases the problem is not technological, so why try to force a technology solution where things are working? We need to be smarter about where we devote our resources\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Carstens said. \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t want to sacrifice what we have that works well.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020191111efbb0018i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

By cross-referencing those summaries with data that must be filed by law to the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , the researchers found that many funds told \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  they held more triple-A and double-A bonds than they actually did.\par \par \uc2 That misreporting ultimately leads investors to put money into misclassified funds, the researchers said. By their estimate, about 30 per cent of high- and medium-credit quality funds were given a less risky profile in recent years than they should have received.\par \par \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  said the researchers had \u8220\'20\'1Cmisunderstood\u8221\'20\'1D the company\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cproprietary methodologies\u8221\'20\'1D and used some of its data incorrectly to make \u8220\'20\'1Csweeping conclusions\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The Chicago-based company is considered the de facto data provider for many financial advisers and retail investors in the US, scoring hundreds of fixed-income funds according to its proprietary star rating system, which blends backward-looking assessments of risk-adjusted performance, cost and other measures. Other academic work has found links between those ratings and investor behaviour, noting big inflows following upgrades and outflows after downgrades.\par \par \uc2 Assets under management in bond funds came to a record $9.4tn at the end of June this year, double the level of 2010, as the spread of negative interest rates across fixed-income markets drove up the value of the bond market globally.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople perceive the star ratings as some kind of endorsement,\u8221\'20\'1D said Samuel Lee, a financial adviser and former strategist for \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 . He added that by relying on self-reported data, the company \u8220\'20\'1Copens itself up to manipulation\u8221\'20\'1D by fund managers, which pay \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  for its services.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFund companies are going to play the game,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s rational behaviour on their part.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In the paper, the academics argue that although \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  has access to the SEC data on funds\u8217\'20\'19 holdings, it chooses to focus on the self-reported summaries, where misreporting of risk is \u8220\'20\'1Cpersistent, widespread, and appears strategic\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Misclassifications are \u8220\'20\'1Coverwhelmingly one-sided\u8221\'20\'1D, the paper argued. \u8220\'20\'1C1 per cent of all misstatements push funds down a category \u8212\'20\'14 99 per cent of misstatements push up to a safer category.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The academics added that misclassifications had the effect of boosting returns for the funds, compared with peers. If the misclassified funds were instead compared with others of a similar risk profile, the outperformance would cease to exist.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe need to make sure [\uc2 Morningstar\uc2  is] doing their job and doing what they say they do, because their job is only going to become more and more important,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Cohen told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Cohen is the LE Simmons professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. Mr Gurun is the Ashbel Smith professor of accounting at the University of Texas at Dallas and Huaizhi Chen is an assistant professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame.\par \par \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  added: \u8220\'20\'1CWe stand by the accuracy of our data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and we are reaching out to the authors with an offer to help understand the data they used and to clarify the\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09methodologies we employ.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020191111efbb003h1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc16}{\*\bkmkend toc16}{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw16\pich17\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal240\pichgoal255

They come from a range of backgrounds in business, government and academia, while their venture-capital firms span some of the largest firms in Silicon Valley to new firms seeking to carve out new pieces of the industry.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Cannon\par \par \uc2 Partner, \uc2 Index Ventures\par \par \uc2 Based in San Francisco, Sarah Cannon invests in startups reshaping the future of work at \uc2 Index Ventures\uc2  and is particularly interested in themes like productivity, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and automation. When Ms. Cannon was hired by Index last year, she became the first woman partner at the firm's U.S. operations. During her roughly year and a half with Index, she worked on the investment into Pitch Software GmbH, and served as board observer at both Pitch and \uc2 Slack Technologies Inc\uc2 . before it went public. Previously, Ms. Cannon spent four years as a principal at \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s venture-capital arm, \uc2 CapitalG\uc2 , where she invested in companies including Looker Data Sciences Inc. Looker Data was acquired by \uc2 Google LLC\uc2  for $2.6 billion in June, a deal that is pending approval from the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . "That was the first investment where I was really leading the charge," Ms. Cannon said. Prior to becoming a venture investor, Ms. Cannon spent a year as a policy adviser on the \uc2 National Economic Council at the White House\uc2  during the Obama administration. She also worked for roughly two years as a consultant at \uc2 McKinsey & Co\uc2 . and spent a year in Ghana as a Fulbright scholar.\par \par \uc2 Connie Chan\par \par \uc2 General Partner, \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\par \par \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  had a policy of never promoting general partners from within, instead hiring investors with outside operational experience. But last year, \uc2 Connie Chan\uc2  broke the mold, becoming the first \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  investor to get promoted to general partner, after working there since 2011. While at the Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm, Ms. Chan sourced the investment in scooter startup \uc2 Neutron Holdings Inc\uc2 ., doing business as Lime, and also advocated for the firm to invest in social media platform \uc2 Pinterest Inc\uc2 . Today, she's looking to make investments in categories such as audio, real estate and e-commerce. For investment professionals looking to move up the ranks to partner, she advised others to speak up and "make sure your opinions are heard."\par \par \uc2 Amanda Eilian\par \par \uc2 Partner, Able Partners\par \par \uc2 Wellness is more than organic skin care and superfoods, according to Able Partners co-founder and Partner Amanda Eilian. Ms. Eilian, whose New York-based firm was launched in 2016 to invest in the booming sector, considers a wide range of startups, including those in fields like clinical mental illness and health care for menopausal women. Portfolio companies include Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Inc., biohacker-focused Bulletproof 360 Inc. and Atai Life Sciences Inc., which is developing psychedelic-based drugs for depression. "We're really interested in areas of stigma," said Ms. Eilian, who formed Able Partners with entrepreneur Lisa Blau. "There's a lot to be done with mental health and sexual wellness, or basically anything for aging women." Ms. Eilian, a graduate of \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 , turned to venture capital after several years working in late-stage private equity and mergers and acquisitions. She also was the founder and vice president of Capital Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition vehicle that had an initial public offering in 2009. She is currently the president of Videolicious Inc., a video creation platform she co-founded in 2007. Able Partners is funded by Ms. Eilian and Ms. Blau, who also saw several companies through to exit. Most, but not all, of Able Partners' portfolio companies are headed by women.\par \par \uc2 Shruti Gandhi\par \par \uc2 Founder, Array Ventures\par \par \uc2 Shruti Gandhi, founder of San Francisco-based Array Ventures, is one of the few pre-seed early-stage investors in business software technology. There are relatively few such investors because of the technical expertise required to evaluate such companies before they have customers or other proof points, according to Ms. Gandhi. "Most don't have the expertise to evaluate deals in the enterprise at this stage," she said. "That's why we get a lot of deal flow from other firms to leverage our expertise." Ms. Gandhi invests in technical founders in areas such as \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Previously an investor at \uc2 True Ventures\uc2 , Samsung Next and Lightbank, she is a solo-general partner who has now raised two venture funds totaling $40 million and has invested in 41 companies. Three companies have been acquired\u8212\'20\'14Hiuy, Simility Inc. and Mobilize Networks Inc. Investors in Array include Foundation Capital, as well as entrepreneur Eric Ries and Richard Socher Inc., chief scientist at Salesforce.com Inc. While solo-general partner firms are rare in venture, Ms. Gandhi says this approach helps her move quickly, which entrepreneurs appreciate. "When you have a lot of partners, there's a lot of politics involved," she said.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Kunst\par \par \uc2 Founder, Cleo Capital\par \par \uc2 Sarah Kunst believes that increasing diversity in the tech industry requires getting more women into decision-making roles in investing. She founded Cleo Capital, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based seed and pre-seed venture firm focused on investing in female scouts and startups. Ms. Kunst, who founded personal fitness startup ProDay Inc. and was an investor at Mohr Davidow Ventures, was previously a scout for Sequoia Capital to invest in early-stage companies. After becoming a scout, she realized there were few women who were scouts and wanted to change that. "I learned almost 90% of scouts were men," she said. Her firm, which has raised $3.5 million for its first fund, invests in both scouts and startups. The scouts include Birchbox Inc. co-founder Mollie Chen and Styleseat Inc. Chief Executive Melody McCloskey. There are not only fewer female investors, but female-led startups often are challenged because they receive less capital, she said. "The problem is both at the top line there's not enough diversity in investing and also there is less capital to play with, so there's less margin for error so it makes it harder" for female entrepreneurs, she said.\par \par \uc2 Kavita Patel\par \par \uc2 Venture Partner, \uc2 New Enterprise Associates\par \par \uc2 Kavita Patel\uc2  built a career in medicine and health-care public policy before joining \uc2 New Enterprise Associates\uc2  as a venture partner based in Washington, D.C., in late 2017. A primary-care physician who earned her medical degree from the University of Texas Health Science Center, Dr. Patel worked for Sen. Ted Kennedy as deputy staff director on health, and later served in the Obama administration, where she was involved in the design of health-care-reform legislation. At NEA, she works with startups such as \uc2 Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc\uc2 ., which develops genomics-based tests designed to optimize cancer treatment. She is also an independent director on the board of NEA-backed primary-care services company Paladina Health LLC.\par \par \uc2 Nicole Quinn\par \par \uc2 Partner, \uc2 Lightspeed Venture Partners\par \par \uc2 Nicole Quinn\uc2  joined Menlo Park, Calif.-based \uc2 Lightspeed Venture Partners\uc2  in 2015 after spending eight years at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 . Ms. Quinn has been making investments in e-commerce, marketplace and other consumer companies. Her investments include women's shoe business Rothy's Inc., meditation app Calm and wedding registry site Zola Inc. She also works on celebrity-driven investments, including Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Inc. and Lady Gaga's Haus Laboratories. Ms. Quinn is looking to make more investments in the social media influencer space after seeing the growth of portfolio company Cameo. Ms. Quinn said the founders she invests in "have a huge vision and one that is true to who they are."\par \par \uc2 Celestine Schnugg\par \par \uc2 General Partner, Boom Capital\par \par \uc2 Celestine Schnugg is a general partner at Boom Capital in San Francisco, where she invests in pre-seed, early-stage startups operating in so-called "frontier tech," or companies whose work lies in highly technical, often overlapping sectors of science and engineering. Ms. Schnugg, who began working at the firm in 2017, is particularly focused on first-time founders newly out of academia, when networking can be challenging. She has led deals in startups such as Mammoth Biosciences Inc., which offers a CRISPR-based platform for researchers, and System1 Biosciences Inc., which is developing neurological drugs by experimenting with miniature brains. Prior to Boom Capital, Ms. Schnugg worked as a partner at Innovation Endeavors and as an associate at \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Alexa von Tobel\par \par \uc2 Founder, Inspired Capital\par \par \uc2 Alexa von Tobel\uc2  wanted to create the kind of venture firm she would have liked as an investor when she was building her startup LearnVest Inc. So, together with Penny Pritzker, former Secretary of Commerce under President Obama, she launched Inspired Capital, a firm that she says is "high on empathy and also high on --commitment" to founders. The New York firm invests in early-stage startups across the U.S. It's raising $200 million for its debut fund, according to a regulatory filing. Ms. von Tobel's firm is made up of operators, like her. She founded LearnVest, an online financial planning service, while attending \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 . Ms. von Tobel raised nearly $75 million for the company before it was sold to \uc2 Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co\uc2 ., in 2015. Ms. von Tobel joined Northwestern, where she became chief digital officer and chief innovation officer and later ran its venture investments. Throughout that time, Ms. von Tobel invested in and advised startups personally. Her new firm has backed companies like Chief, a network for executive women, and Rho, a mobile bank for small businesses. Inspired Capital invests across sectors, but financial services that help people better manage money continues to be dear to Ms. von Tobel's heart. "Some great technology solutions are on the radar, but it's something that still keeps me up at night," Ms. von Tobel said about America's financial literacy.\par \par \uc2 Lisa Wu\par \par \uc2 Partner, \uc2 Norwest Venture Partners\par \par \uc2 Lisa Wu joined \uc2 Norwest Venture Partners\uc2  in 2012 and spent the first part of her career there initiating investments in the New York area. Ms. Wu sourced the firm's investment in \uc2 Jet.com Inc\uc2 ., which was acquired by \uc2 Walmart Inc\uc2 . for $3.3 billion. Ms. Wu also led Norwest's investment in Ritual, a women's health brand. Last year, Ms. Wu was promoted to partner. She focuses on seed- to late-stage investing in consumer internet, digital commerce and future marketplaces. Previously, Ms. Wu scouted acquisition and investment targets for \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and worked at \uc2 Bessemer Venture Partners\uc2 , focusing on consumer and software investments. Before her rise as an investor, Ms. Wu got a taste of the business side\u8212\'20\'14she founded Banzai! Fresh, a small business providing nutritious foods to schools and hospitals in Northern California.\par \par \uc2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\par \par \uc2 Venture Capital Previous Classes\par \par \uc2 Below are the women who have appeared on our previous years' lists.\par \par \uc2 CLASS OF 2015/16*\par \par \uc2 Joanne Chen, Partner, Foundation Capital\par \par \uc2 Maria Cirino, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, .406 Ventures\par \par \uc2 Anu Duggal, Founder, Female Founders Fund\par \par \uc2 Jan Garfinkle, Founder and Managing Director, Arboretum Ventures\par \par \uc2 Wende Hutton, General Partner, \uc2 Canaan Partners\par \par \uc2 Rebeca Hwang Scheel, Managing Partner, Rivet Ventures\par \par \uc2 Kim Kamdar\uc2 , Partner, \uc2 Domain Associates\uc2 , Partner,\par \par \uc2 Jenny Lefcourt, Partner, \uc2 Freestyle Capital\par \par \uc2 Swati Mylavarapu, Partner, \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\par \par \uc2 Julie Papanek, Principal, \uc2 Canaan Partners\par \par \uc2 Shauntel Poulson, General Partner, Reach Capital\par \par \uc2 Ellie Wheeler, General Partner, Greycroft Partners\par \par \uc2 CLASS OF 2017*\par \par \uc2 Kate Castle, Marketing Partner, \uc2 Flybridge Capital Partners\uc2 ; Operating Partner, XFactor Ventures\par \par \uc2 Kirsten Green\uc2 , Founding Partner, \uc2 Forerunner Ventures\uc2 , Founding Partner,\par \par \uc2 Paulina Hill, Principal, Polaris Partners\par \par \uc2 Shadi Mehraein, General Partner, Rivet Ventures\par \par \uc2 Renata Quintini, Partner, \uc2 Lux Capital\par \par \uc2 Kristina Shen, Partner, \uc2 Bessemer Venture Partners\par \par \uc2 Lisa Suennen, Senior Managing Director, GE Ventures\par \par \uc2 Sarah Tavel, General Partner, Benchmark\par \par \uc2 CLASS OF 2018*\par \par \uc2 Christine Aylward, Managing Partner, Magnetic Ventures\par \par \uc2 Enke Bashllari, Managing Director, Arkitekt Ventures\par \par \uc2 Abbie Celniker, Partner, \uc2 Third Rock Ventures\par \par \uc2 Sarah Guo, Partner, \uc2 Greylock Partners\par \par \uc2 Kathryn Haun, General Partner, a16z Crypto\par \par \uc2 Annie Kadavy, Partner, \uc2 Redpoint Ventures\par \par \uc2 Angela Tran Kingyens, General Partner, \uc2 Version One Ventures\par \par \uc2 Clare Ozawa, Managing Director, Versant Ventures\par \par \uc2 Heidi Krauel Patel, Partner, Rethink Impact\par \par \uc2 Linda Xie, Co-Founder and Managing Director, Scalar Capital\par \par \uc2 *Titles of prior Women to Watch reflect the titles the women held at the time they were named to the list.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20191110efba0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

This year's honorees on our Women to Watch list include some of the most talented professionals involved on both sides of private-equity fund negotiations.\par \par \uc2 Alicia Cooney\par \par \uc2 Co-Founder and Managing Director, Monument Group\par \par \uc2 Alicia Cooney, a co-founder of placement agent Monument Group, has helped build two successful businesses during her more than 40 years in finance. Before co-founding Monument with John McLaren in 1994, Ms. Cooney spent 13 years building the research arm at Boston-based \uc2 Cambridge Associates\uc2 . She and Mr. McLaren launched Monument to create a placement firm grounded in \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , an approach that wasn't common at the time. "I firmly believe that if you start a business, the most successful are ones that have a well-founded knowledge base and can perceive the opportunities," Ms. Cooney said. "I would love to start a restaurant because I love to cook, but that would be completely foolhardy on my part. I don't know about the restaurant business. I understood the pros and cons of the placement agents, because they were all calling on me [at \uc2 Cambridge\uc2 ]." Ms. Cooney also served as a founding board member of the Tuck Center for Private Equity and Venture Capital at \uc2 Dartmouth College\uc2  and was a longtime member of the investment committee at Wellesley College.\par \par \uc2 Monica Davis\par \par \uc2 Director, \uc2 L Catterton\par \par \uc2 Monica Davis, a director of investor relations at \uc2 L Catterton\uc2 , manages more than 300 limited-partner relationships across seven fund strategies in addition to focusing on capital raising. Before entering her present position at the beginning of the year, she spent seven years at \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 ., focusing on global capital raising and business development activities across alternative asset classes as a director in the client relations and partner group. Her experience also includes working as an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. as part of the private-equity funds group. While at \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2 , Ms. Davis moved to the spinout firm Mercury Capital Advisors, where she worked on private-equity fundraising. She earned M.B.A.s from \uc2 London Business School\uc2  and \uc2 Columbia Business School\uc2  after graduating summa cum laude from \uc2 Howard University\uc2  with a bachelor's degree in finance.\par \par \uc2 Anisa Javeri\par \par \uc2 Managing Director and Founding Member, \uc2 Evercore Inc\uc2 .'s Private Funds Group\par \par \uc2 Anisa Javeri, a founding member of \uc2 Evercore Inc\uc2 .'s private funds group, is one of the co-heads of the U.S. advisory team of theprivate-equity capital-raising arm of the New York-based investment bank. The role makes her responsible for all capital raises for U.S.-based private-equity clients in buyout, growth, infrastructure and credit. Some of the largest and most notable fundraisings she has worked on are infrastructure investor \uc2 I Squared Capital\uc2 's $7 billion second fund, which closed last year; Genstar Capital's three most recent funds, the latest of which closed in February at $5.5 billion; and software investor \uc2 K1 Investment Management\uc2 's $2 billion K4 Private Investors. Before joining Evercore, Ms. Javeri worked in \uc2 Neuberger Berman LLC\uc2 's alternatives advisory and placement group, and in the same group at \uc2 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc\uc2 . before that. She graduated from the \uc2 University of Warwick\uc2  in England.\par \par \uc2 Amanda Outerbridge\par \par \uc2 Managing Director, HarbourVest Partners\par \par \uc2 Amanda Outerbridge is a managing director in the primary partnership team at Boston-based \uc2 HarbourVest Partners\uc2 . Over the course of her career since joining the firm in 2000, Ms. Outerbridge has traversed the globe, including a year-long stint in the firm's London office and two years in Hong Kong. She has built a strong reputation, in particular for helping HarbourVest develop a world-class venture portfolio, according to Managing Director Scott Voss. "Amanda has been phenomenal at accessing new relationships and getting us in the top-performing managers," Mr. Voss said. Managing Director and Head of Investments Greg Stento added that the global perspective Ms. Outerbridge has gained has informed not only her investment judgment but also her ability to connect with other people. "She's not afraid to get into the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and look at the detailed numbers and models that get built around an investment," Mr. Stento said. "But she's also a terrific people person. She has a way of putting people at ease and building relationships with almost any type of person." Ms. Outerbridge herself said she believes that having a long-term perspective on relationship building has helped boost her career. "It's really a marathon, not a sprint," she added.\par \par \uc2 Imogen Richards\par \par \uc2 Partner, Pantheon\par \par \uc2 As partner and global head of Pantheon's investment structuring and strategy, Imogen Richards has made a direct impact on the pace and efficiency of investment deployment. Her team currently oversees more than 100 different client portfolios with about $11 billion of dry powder across all of Pantheon's strategies. The team also manages the allocations of all of the firm's deals between clients. In 2018 alone, the investment structuring team closed 136 transactions with a value of $5.2 billion. Her team is currently looking to close nearly 45 deals. Her advice to other women is to "always put your hand up for doing things you're interested in." She tells them, "Do your job really well so that people trust you and they're willing to allow you the space to do new and exciting things." Ms. Richards joined Pantheon from \uc2 Anglo Irish Bank Corp\uc2 . in Dublin and holds a master's degree in natural sciences from \uc2 Cambridge University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Jill Shaw\par \par \uc2 Managing Director, Cambridge Associates\par \par \uc2 As director of private markets for consultancy Cambridge Associates, Jill Shaw develops ideas for new private investments and builds portfolios for the firm's nonprofit clients and high-net-worth families ranging in size from $60 million to $4.5 billion. She also leads \uc2 Cambridge\uc2 's efforts on developing best practices for benchmarking private investments, a subject on which she has published several papers. A graduate of Babson College in Massachusetts, Ms. Shaw began her career at \uc2 Cambridge\uc2  in 2001 as a member of the firm's investment-performance group. She rose to manage that group, overseeing a team of more than 30 people responsible for analyzing more than 2,700 private-markets investments, and designed the firm's current version of quarterly performance reports for private clients. Ms. Shaw then returned to Babson for her M.B.A. before rejoining \uc2 Cambridge\uc2  in 2007 as an investment director. She began managing portfolios on a discretionary basis in 2012, and in 2014 was named managing director.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Compiled by Chris Cumming, Laura Kreutzer & Isaac Taylor\par \par \uc2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\par \par \uc2 Women to Watch in LP and Fundraising Communities Previous Classes\par \par \uc2 Below are the women who have appeared on our previous years' lists.*\par \par \uc2 CLASS OF 2016\par \par \uc2 Andrea Auerbach\uc2 , Managing Director, Cambridge Associates\par \par \uc2 Tatiana Chopova, Managing Director, AlpInvest Partners\par \par \uc2 Michelle Davidson, Managing Director, TorreyCove Capital Partners\par \par \uc2 Joelle Kayden, Managing Member, Accolade Partners\par \par \uc2 Andrea Kramer\uc2 , Managing Director, \uc2 Hamilton Lane\uc2 , Managing Director,\par \par \uc2 Melissa Ma, Managing Partner, Asia Alternatives\par \par \uc2 Susan Long McAndrews, Partner, Pantheon\par \par \uc2 Diane Mulcahy, Senior Fellow, \uc2 Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation\par \par \uc2 Olivia Ouyang, Director, Private Funds, \uc2 Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan\par \par \uc2 JoAnn Price, Managing Partner, Fairview Capital Partners\par \par \uc2 Joanna Rupp, Managing Director of Private Equity, University of Chicago\par \par \uc2 CLASS OF 2017\par \par \uc2 Kathleen Bacon, Managing Director, HarbourVest Partners\par \par \uc2 Meghna Desai, Director of Investments, New York-Presbyterian Hospital\par \par \uc2 Jennifer Cho Rinehart, Partner and CEO, Acalyx Advisors Inc.\par \par \uc2 Sheryl Schwartz, Managing Director of Investments, Caspian Private Equity\par \par \uc2 Suzanne Streeter, Partner and Head of Private Markets, Partners Capital\par \par \uc2 Margot Wirth, Director of Private Equity, \uc2 California State Teachers' Retirement System\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CLASS OF 2018\par \par \uc2 Kelli Roiter, Global Head, Private Capital Group, \uc2 Jefferies LLC\par \par \uc2 Susannah Carrier, Head of Fundraising and Investor Relations, Silver Lake\par \par \uc2 Kelly Williams, Senior Adviser, \uc2 Grosvenor Capital Management\par \par \uc2 Andrea Minardi, Senior Research Fellow Professor, Insper Institute of Education and Research\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20191110efba0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Fund managers have come under pressure in recent years to divest from companies that can harm human rights \u8212\'20\'14 from gun manufacturers or retailers to operators of private prisons. The focus is now switching to the less tangible but equally serious human rights risks lurking in fund managers\u8217\'20\'19 technology holdings.\par \par \uc2 Attention on technology groups began with concerns around data privacy, but emerging focal points are targeted advertising and how companies deal with online extremism.\par \par \uc2 Following a terrorist attack in New Zealand this year where the shooter posted video footage of the incident online, investors managing assets of more than NZ$90bn (US$57bn) urged \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and Alphabet, \uc2 Google\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s parent company, to take more action in dealing with violent or extremist content published on their platforms.\par \par \uc2 The Investor Alliance for Human Rights is currently co-ordinating a global engagement effort with Alphabet over the governance of its \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology, data privacy and online extremism.\par \par \uc2 Investor engagement on the topic of digital human rights is in its infancy. One roadblock for investors has been the difficulty they face in detecting and measuring what the actual risks are.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CMost investors do not have a very good understanding of the implications of all of the issues in the digital space and don\u8217\'20\'19t have sufficient research and tools to properly assess them \u8212\'20\'14 and that goes for companies too,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms Compere.\par \par \uc2 One rare resource available is the Ranking Digital Rights Corporate Accountability Index, established in 2015, which rates tech companies based on a range of metrics. The development of such tools gives investors more information on the risk associated with technological advancements, enabling them to hold companies to account when they identify risks and questionable ethics.\par \par \uc2 Another challenge is the pace of technological advancements. \u8220\'20\'1CThe concern is that technological changes are being quickly driven through by companies but sometimes we don\u8217\'20\'19t stop and ask what is the human rights impact,\u8221\'20\'1D said John Howchin, secretary-general of the\u160\'00\'A0Swedish AP funds\u8217\'20\'19 ethics council.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CIn future it will be seen as a wild west.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This point is highlighted by the fierce debate surrounding \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and\u160\'00\'A0facial recognition software. Hailed as a way to make society more efficient, investors are grappling with the fact that facial recognition can also be used for unethical purposes. Critics of the software say companies that manufacture and sell it may not be aware of how it is being used, especially when adopted by governments for military purposes.\par \par \uc2 Facial and emotion recognition systems are notably deployed by the Chinese government for surveillance in the Xinjiang region, where an estimated 1m mostly Muslim minorities are held in internment camps. In the US, activists and privacy groups claim the technology is used in a harmful way by federal agencies such as \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2  and Customs and Border Protection.\par \par \uc2 There are also concerns about flaws and biases in facial recognition programmes.\u160\'00\'A0A test by \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  last year found that \uc2 Amazon\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s facial recognition technology, Rekognition, wrongly identified 28 members of Congress as arrestees. Research has also shown that the software registers more cases of mistaken identity with women and minorities.\par \par \uc2 Carola van Lamoen, head of active ownership at Robeco, the \u8364\'20\'AC199bn asset manager, said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe see the ability of AI to facilitate growth potential for technology companies but we also see the associated risks.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Complicating the picture is the absence of harmonised regulations governing AI. Robeco recently embarked on a probe into the social impact of AI prompted by concerns that the advancements were outpacing the development of rules or principles.\par \par \uc2 In the US, for example, a handful of cities have banned local government and law enforcement agencies from deploying facial recognition software but federal agencies can still use it.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat worries investors [about AI] is that the technology is being developed in a vacuum \u8212\'20\'14 we\u8217\'20\'19re not seeing a global norm around it,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms Compere.\par \par \uc2 Several companies, including \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  and \uc2 IBM\uc2 , have taken initial steps to protect against unintended risks by adopting codes of AI ethics.\par \par \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  has been particularly vocal, calling last year for \u8220\'20\'1Ca government initiative to regulate the proper use of facial recognition technology\u8221\'20\'1D. This year the company declined a request from a California law enforcement agency to install facial recognition technology in officers\u8217\'20\'19 cars and body cameras over human rights concerns.\par \par \uc2 Despite \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s decision, few companies have gone public on how risks to human rights influence their business decisions and affect which contracts they accept or decline.\par \par \uc2 Some investors are using their voice within companies to make a stand. The \uc2 Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility\uc2 , a coalition of responsible investors managing more than $400bn in assets, this year filed a resolution at \uc2 Amazon\uc2  calling for it to stop selling Rekognition to governments until it had completed a review into whether it posed a threat to civil and human rights.\par \par \uc2 Other investors want companies to integrate human rights considerations into their formal risk management assessments and make senior executives accountable for this. \u8220\'20\'1CWe want companies to do their homework,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms van Lamoen. \u8220\'20\'1CThey should know when and how AI is used, assess the potential impacts and actively monitor this at board level.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTechnology companies have had issues involving human rights over the past few years,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Howchin.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CWe think there\u8217\'20\'19s a need for the whole technology sector to better understand human rights and start hiring people who are specialist in human rights.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This involves asking companies to train their AI designers to consider human rights during the product development process. \u8220\'20\'1CUnless concepts are baked in to the actual design of newer technologies from the get-go, it is a lot harder to control human rights implications,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms Compere.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191110efba000b7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Just weeks before WeWork expected its stock to begin trading publicly, the startup was still wrangling with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  over a controversial key financial metric and a litany of other concerns about its planned multibillion-dollar IPO.\par \par \uc2 On Sept. 11\u8212\'20\'14after the initial public offering prospectus had been public for nearly a month, and after the SEC had already made dozens of demands about the document\u8212\'20\'14the regulator sent the shared-workspace company a list of 13 still-unresolved concerns, according to previously unpublished correspondence reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 The back-and-forth shows that WeWork was scrambling to clean up big problems as its IPO was crumbling. The timing was indicative of the chaotic management that gave investors pause and ultimately led the company to pull the offering and Chief Executive \uc2 Adam Neumann\uc2  to step down under pressure.\par \par \uc2 We Co\uc2 ., as the WeWork parent is known, had filed its draft prospectus confidentially with the SEC for review in December 2018, giving the company months to negotiate with the agency behind closed doors about its contents before unveiling it to the public.\par \par \uc2 But as the IPO loomed, the SEC zeroed in on how WeWork framed its heavy losses, particularly through a bespoke profitability metric called "contribution margin," a version of which had formerly been known as "community-adjusted Ebitda." The agency had first ordered WeWork to remove the measure, before the company offered to substantially change it.\par \par \uc2 In mid-September, the day before WeWork had hoped to start the roadshow to peddle its IPO to investors, the metric was still mentioned in its revised prospectus more than 100 times. The company planned to amend the filing before starting the roadshow, according to a person close to WeWork\u8212\'20\'14but instead shelved the IPO, as investors questioned the company's worth and its corporate governance.\par \par \uc2 "It's highly unusual to have issues that are so important still being disputed while they are out there marketing the stock to investors," said Minor Myers, a law professor at the University of Connecticut who reviewed the correspondence at the Journal's request. As WeWork was battling the SEC over its metrics, its advisers were "figuring what they can sell using these numbers," Mr. Myers added.\par \par \uc2 WeWork deployed a battalion of Wall Street lawyers to try to win over the regulator, according to people close to the tumultuous process.\par \par \uc2 The SEC sent Mr. Neumann a nine-page letter on Aug. 30, telling WeWork to remove mentions of contribution margin. "As currently calculated and presented, we believe that your [contribution margin] measure could be misleading," the letter said. "Please remove disclosure of this measure throughout your registration statement."\par \par \uc2 The letter also questioned forecasts that assumed 100% occupancy of offices leased out by WeWork, and pushed for greater clarity on a $5.9 million payment WeWork made\u8212\'20\'14and later reversed\u8212\'20\'14to a company controlled by Mr. Neumann for rights to the word "We," which he had trademarked.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. Neumann said he and the company "disclosed related-party transactions in the [prospectus] in accordance with applicable law and good governance."\par \par \uc2 WeWork fought back hard, especially on contribution margin, the correspondence shows. One version of the metric, which previously {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-and-lyft-get-creative-with-numbers-but-investors-arent-blind-to-the-losses-11557826202"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WeWork had called community-adjusted Ebitda}}}\uc2 , was widely derided because it excludes costs to such an extent that it flipped WeWork's bottom line for 2018 from a net loss of about $1.9 billion using standard accounting, to a $467 million profit.\par \par \uc2 WeWork's resistance to removing the metric was directed by Mr. Neumann, people familiar with the discussions said. Mr. Neumann had previously boasted about the metric to reporters and investors, to show how the company's core business was profitable.\par \par \uc2 Within five days of receiving the SEC's Aug. 30 letter, WeWork's advisers at two top-tier Wall Street law firms, \uc2 Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP\uc2  and \uc2 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\uc2 , sent responses totaling 45 pages, including a letter focused solely on two financial metrics, and filed a revised, 223-page prospectus.\par \par \uc2 The Cravath letter, from former senior SEC official John White, said WeWork still believed its metrics were fair but was willing to ax those the SEC most objected to\u8212\'20\'14excluding certain lease costs\u8212\'20\'14to try to "find a course forward." Mr. White and a Skadden spokeswoman didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Many of the SEC's comments to WeWork "went straight to the heart of the issues that ultimately caused the IPO to unravel," said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado, who reviewed the correspondence for the Journal. "The SEC staff shined a laser light on many of the business metrics and spotted a number of the conflicts of interest and holes in the prospectus," he said.\par \par \uc2 An SEC spokeswoman said the agency doesn't comment on individual companies' filings.\par \par \uc2 Among other issues the SEC targeted was what the WeWork prospectus called "illustrative annual economics." The agency questioned how the company had arrived at some rosy numbers. "Please explain to readers and tell us how your assumed workstation utilization rate of 100% is realistic," its letter said. In reply, WeWork agreed to drop the illustrative economics section from the prospectus.\par \par \uc2 Related Reading\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-wework-grew-wall-street-lent-it-money-and-credibility-11573209003?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=5"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 As WeWork Grew, Wall Street Lent It Money and Credibility}}}\uc2  (Nov. 8)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-books-loss-of-4-7-billion-on-wework-investment-11573024776?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SoftBank Founder Calls His Judgment 'Really Bad' After $4.7 Billion WeWork Hit}}}\uc2  (Nov. 6)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fall-of-wework-how-a-startup-darling-came-unglued-11571946003?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Fall of WeWork: How a Startup Darling Came Unglued}}}\uc2  (Oct. 24)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-the-way-everybody-behaves-how-adam-neumanns-over-the-top-style-built-wework-11568823827?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How Adam Neumann's Over-the-Top Style Built WeWork}}}\uc2  (Sept. 18)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/wework-78b422dc?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Read More of WSJ's WeWork Reporting}}}\par \par \uc2 WeWork's liberal use of customized metrics that don't comply with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, was central to its wrangling with the SEC, according to people close to the process. The draft prospectus WeWork filed in December cited at least six non-GAAP metrics; by the time it issued the prospectus in August, the tally had fallen.\par \par \uc2 Despite going through several revisions, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-investors-turned-off-by-sloppy-ipo-filings-11570440674"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 prospectus WeWork made public in August}}}\uc2  contained significant errors and omissions, the Journal has reported.\par \par \uc2 This past Friday, after markets closed, WeWork published a slide deck from Oct. 11\u8212\'20\'14after Mr. Neumann resigned\u8212\'20\'14that showed financial results including a "location contribution margin" that appeared to be a renamed version of the metric at the center of its dispute with the SEC.\par \par \uc2 SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\par \par \uc2 Which parts of the correspondence between WeWork and the SEC should have set off alarms for all parties involved? Join the conversation below.\par \par \uc2 The SEC is stepping up scrutiny of creative financial measures, lawyers said. Nearly all big companies now use at least one non-GAAP financial metric. Last year, 97% of S&P 500 companies used non-GAAP metrics, up from 59% in 1996, according to an analysis for the Journal by research firm Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It isn't unusual for companies to go through several rounds of comments with the SEC in the run-up to an IPO.

But human interaction is still required for more complex requirements, discovers Damian Fantato\par \par \uc2 Think of a financial adviser and the chances are you will think of a middle-aged man in a suit with a fondness for spreadsheets. But for a new generation of customers, a regulated adviser could take the form of a digital chatbot, powered by \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  with a penchant for emojis.\par \par \uc2 The traditional advice world is being digitally disrupted by a wave of financial advice services using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which claim to provide clients with a personal recommendation the threshold which distinguishes advice from guidance without human intervention.\par \par \uc2 Billed by some as the solution to the UK's "advice gap", these "advisers" currently exist in the form of chatbots asking questions about our financial choices. Many think the technology will evolve even further which has mixed implications for traditional financial advisers but will clients really take advice from a robot? Mind the advice gap In the past 10 years, financial advice as we know it has gone through a serious shake up. The Retail Distribution Review in 2013 banned commission payments to advisers, beefing up cost disclosures and training requirements for advisers.\par \par \uc2 This may have increased the quality of advice, but it has been attributed to the number of financial advisers falling from more than 40,000 in 2011 to about 26,000 today. High street banks left the advice market although the rise of robo advice is now tempting some to come back in but the higher cost of regulation meant many traditional firms shifted their focus to the wealthiest, highest margin clients and away from the mass market.\par \par \uc2 This is the "advice gap" which advocates claim AI can now help fill.\par \par \uc2 Waiting to help them is MyEva, a "digital financial adviser" which uses algorithms to provide regulated advice on pensions, savings and investments through a chatbot, backed by a team of human advisers.\par \par \uc2 MyEva is the creation of digital advisory firm Wealth Wizards, which is regulated by the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\uc2 . Chief executive Andrew Firth says the app is aimed squarely at the "mass employed" who face similar financial issues one of which is the lack of access to straightforward, affordable advice. "The majority of our revenue is from employers who are buying MyEva for their employees," he says, adding that most offer it free as part of their wider staff benefits package.\par \par \uc2 Intriguingly, the firm plumped for a female chatbot because the financial advice profession is dominated by men and this was one way to "help address the balance". The name Eva was chosen because it is defined on slang website Urban Dictionary as "a person of extreme knowledge and high standards".\par \par \uc2 After an online "financial healthcheck", Eva will suggest ways that users can achieve their goals.\par \par \uc2 Mr Firth says younger employees tend to have quite straightforward questions about pension top-ups and Isa investing which can be handled by the chatbot in language they understand (MyEva's slogan is "no jargon, no pressure").\par \par \uc2 If users are debt free and have savings, they can access investment advice but only once their risk appetite has been assessed.\par \par \uc2 MyEva will then recommend passive funds from the Vanguard Lifestrategy range, chosen because they were considered appropriate for firsttime, "Middle Britain" investors. Conversations about retirement planning, decumulation and anything more complex will go through to a human adviser. "If Eva has something she is not sure about, she books an appointment for you with a phone adviser who will pick up the conversation," Mr Firth adds.\par \par \uc2 He estimates that about 80 per cent of MyEva's clients are handled by the chatbot, with the rest speaking to a human adviser on the phone.\par \par \uc2 Employers will pick up these advice charges, depending on their agreement, or individuals can pay up front. Services include a pensions "tidy up" to review and potentially consolidate company pensions, charged from \u163\'00\'A3150 per pot. An investment planning report starts at \u163\'00\'A3150. More complex tasks such as inheritance tax planning cost \u163\'00\'A31,500.\par \par \uc2 Wealth Wizards, in which insurer LV= has a minority stake, has already signed up more than a dozen clients including \uc2 Unilever\uc2 , Calvin Klein and some \uc2 NHS\uc2  trusts.\par \par \uc2 Individuals can subscribe to MyEva for \u163\'00\'A32 per month, though relatively few people have done so. "We are not marketing this version as we are concentrating on employers for the time being," Mr Firth adds.\par \par \uc2 Multiple options A different approach is taken by Multiply, a regulated advisory firm that gained \uc2 FCA\uc2  approval for its app in July. Already available on iOS, the Android launch is expected next year.\par \par \uc2 Multiply targets younger clients over traditional advisers workers in their twenties, thirties and forties who have "just got on top of their cash flow", according to chief executive Vivek Madlani.\par \par \uc2 Once users have downloaded the app, he says they are taken through "a similar process that an adviser will go through we assess attitude to risk and capacity for loss, where a customer is in terms of their finances, what they are investing towards."\par \par \uc2 Mr Madlani says Multiply's younger clients tend to be most interested in saving to buy a home, but plenty are interested in pensions and investments. This is where the app's "product engine" kicks in.\par \par \uc2 As well as savings tips, Multiply offers Isas, Sipps and general investment accounts and can recommend portfolios consisting of between one and three multi-asset passive funds.\par \par \uc2 In future, Multiply aims to offer access to products including mortgages and income protection policies. As well as providing advice to the mass market, Multiply also promises to do so for "free" though this is not quite as good as it sounds.\par \par \uc2 The company uses what advisers refer to as contingent charging model the advice is effectively free, but the adviser charges for implementation. So Multiply is only paid if clients go ahead with its recommendations.\par \par \uc2 Mr Madlani says this is clearly explained to users of the app, but he accepts there are limits to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -powered advice.\par \par \uc2 "To be honest, there is a boundary beyond which we don't want to accept the risks, such as final salary pension scheme transfers [or] buying an annuity."\par \par \uc2 About 25 per cent of those who use the app are not considered to be suitable investors for a variety of reasons; if, for example, they have high levels of debt. However, Multiply does not currently pass on their details to advisers such as debt charities something Mr Madlani says the company is looking to address.\par \par \uc2 TheUSdimension Ramya Joseph, the founder and\u163\'00\'A3chief executive of Pefin, which claimsto be the first company in the world tooffer AI advice, is more bullish aboutthe technology's ability.\par \par \uc2 The US company does not operatein the UK though it is in discussionswith potential partners to address this. Ms Joseph believes there are fewpersonal finance scenarios that AI cannot handle, but that this wouldnot necessarily mean the end ofhuman advisers.\par \par \uc2 'AI can complement a human adviser and allow them to spend more time focusing on both the client relationship as well as more specialised financial needs' such as complex business and trust structures."\par \par \uc2 Nutmeg, one of the UK's largeston line investment managers, is looking at how it can use AI to improve itsnascent advice service launched latelast year using human beings.\par \par \uc2 "We area technology-led businessand believe there is huge potential forAI to make advice more efficient andtherefore make it possible to servemany more clients," says Lisa Caplan,Nutmeg's head of financial advice.\par \par \uc2 "In the future, there will be agreater role for \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 ,which is already used to detectchanges in behaviour such as excessive account log ins."\par \par \uc2 There could be opportunities for"traditional" financial advice businesses to invest in AI to provide a cheaper service for parts of their business, with a human face attached.\par \par \uc2 Andy Thompson, chief executive of Quilter Financial Planning, the UK's second largest advice firm, says his company is investing in automation.\par \par \uc2 "In the US, AI is more advanced and they are moving away from the dichotomy of face-to-face advice versus robo-advice. A hybrid form of advice is becoming increasingly common, which is something I think the UK will also be embracing.\par \par \uc2 "The power of technology to improve efficiency and lower costs both for advisers and their clients is immense. Ultimately, the relationship between an adviser is intimate one and cannot be replaced by AI."\par \par \uc2 Regulatory worries Other commentators point out that advice chatbots are not replacing traditional advisers, but making it possible for regulated firms to serve a hitherto unadvised client base.\par \par \uc2 But regulators are concerned that the boundaries between regulated financial advice and DIY investment platforms where the risk is on the individual are becoming blurred, which could put consumers at risk.\par \par \uc2 Wanda Goldwag, chairman of the Financial Services Consumer Panel, says she is "concerned that regulated advice is not clearly distinguished from 'execution-only' transactions.\par \par \uc2 "Consumers need to know, when using robo-advice services, whether they will be protected by the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme when things go wrong," she says, adding that there is a need for greater transparency on costs and charges associated with advice.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FCA\uc2  declined to comment on whether it shared these concerns, but has previously highlighted "weaknesses" in the way some automated robo advice services support vulnerable consumers, such as those who had recently suffered a bereavement.\par \par \uc2 Yet one of the risks that AI advisers themselves acknowledge is the possibility that if something goes wrong, it will go wrong for a lot of people.\par \par \uc2 Mr Madlani, who is himself a qualified adviser, says: "We have put so much work into ensuring we have set up the right checks and balances into our advice engine. Ultimately I am not the guy who wants to go to jail for years for providing millions of people with unsuitable advice. It has taken us almost three years to launch, which says something."\par \par \uc2 Mr Madlani points out that Multiply employs regulated financial advisers, but to check that the advice it is providing is suitable, not to advise clients directly.\par \par \uc2 Ms Joseph says her company also spent years testing its advice model and employs human advisers to check its advice.\par \par \uc2 We need to talk AI advice is currently confined to chatbots, but some predict clients will soon be able to talk at home via their smart speaker.\par \par \uc2 "If you talk to a chat interface, then it is not that big a step to get voice recognition and voice-to-text," says Mr Firth of Wealth Wizards.\par \par \uc2 Ms Joseph agrees: "In five to seven years it will be possible for consumers to widely accept automated advice as a service interacting with voice recognition technology."\par \par \uc2 But will younger clients be happy with this form of advice? Adam O'Brien, a 30-year-old data scientist from south London, falls squarely into the target market he has accumulated cash savings, but has never considered investing them.\par \par \uc2 "I really don't know what products are out there apart from the Isas or savings accounts from the mainstream banks, and the interest rates seem so low now that it doesn't seem worth the effort to spend too much time looking into it," he says.\par \par \uc2 He has signed up to Multiply and is in the process of trying it out.\par \par \uc2 "If the advice from pre-determined algorithms takes the risk of receiving advice from a less skilled or experienced adviser, or one just having an off day, then I have no issues with the lack of human oversight."\par \par \uc2 However, the traditional advice industry isn't unduly worried by AI.\par \par \uc2 "Given the communication skills and empathy needed to fulfil the entire role of a professional financial adviser, it is unlikely that AI will be able to replicate this any time soon," says \uc2 Keith Richards\uc2 , chief executive of the Personal Finance Society.\par \par \uc2 The services he stresses the robots cannot replicate are those that older and richer clients are prepared to pay for "understanding [a client's] goals for themselves and their wider family; how their finances fit in with their career; educating them about investments and helping them understand how they will manage different risks."\par \par \uc2 For younger generations with less complex financial needs who are already comfortable asking \uc2 Amazon\uc2 's Alexa to buy things for them, perhaps that doesn't matter.\par \par \uc2 Damian Fantato is deputy editor of FTAdviser\par \par \uc2 If users are debt free and have savings, they can access investment advice but only once their risk appetite has been assessed\par \par \uc2 'AI can complement a human adviser and allow them to spend more time focusing on the client relationship and specialised financial needs'\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020191109efb9000p7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Frequently, AI-based startups aim to solve longstanding problems in the pharmaceutical industry, such as drugmakers' inability to develop compounds that bind effectively to the vast majority of proteins in the body.\par \par \uc2 For example, Atomwise uses its AI capabilities mostly to search for compounds that hit protein targets that haven't been drugged before. Its ability to find those hits has enabled it to raise $51 million from tech and life sciences investors such as Khosla Ventures and Data Collective.\par \par \uc2 Atomwise and some other startups are producing tangible results now, but the ultimate proof of the value of AI will come when drugs discovered with the help of the technology earn regulatory approval, a process that remains lengthy because of the need for clinical testing.\par \par \uc2 "There's a long path to get to medicines, everybody agrees on that," Atomwise co-founder and CEO Abraham Heifets said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Brian Gormley at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:brian.gormley@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 brian.gormley@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20191108efb80002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But for a new generation of customers, a regulated adviser could take the form of a digital chatbot, powered by \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  with a penchant for emojis.\par \par \uc2 The traditional advice world is being digitally disrupted by a new wave of financial advice services using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which claim to provide clients with a personal recommendation \u8212\'20\'14 the threshold which distinguishes advice from guidance \u8212\'20\'14 without human intervention.\par \par \uc2 Billed by some as the solution to the UK\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cadvice gap\u8221\'20\'1D, these \u8220\'20\'1Cadvisers\u8221\'20\'1D currently exist in the form of chatbots asking questions about our financial choices. Many think the technology will evolve even further \u8212\'20\'14 which has mixed implications for traditional financial advisers \u8212\'20\'14 but will clients really take advice from a robot?\par \par \uc2 Mind the advice gap\par \par \uc2 In the past 10 years, financial advice as we know it has gone through a serious shake up. The Retail Distribution Review in 2013 banned commission payments to advisers, beefing up cost disclosures and training requirements for advisers.\par \par \uc2 This may have increased the quality of advice, but it has been attributed to the number of financial advisers falling from more than 40,000 in 2011 to about 26,000 today. High street banks left the advice market \u8212\'20\'14 although the rise of robo advice is now tempting some to come back in \u8212\'20\'14 but the higher cost of regulation meant many traditional firms shifted their focus to the wealthiest, highest margin clients and away from the mass market.\par \par \uc2 This is the \u8220\'20\'1Cadvice gap\u8221\'20\'1D which advocates claim AI can now help fill.\par \par \uc2 Waiting to help them is MyEva, a \u8220\'20\'1Cdigital financial adviser\u8221\'20\'1D which uses algorithms to provide regulated advice on pensions, savings and investments through a chatbot, backed by a team of human advisers.\par \par \uc2 MyEva is the creation of digital advisory firm Wealth Wizards, which is regulated by the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\uc2 . Chief executive Andrew Firth says the app is aimed squarely at the \u8220\'20\'1Cmass employed\u8221\'20\'1D who face similar financial issues \u8212\'20\'14 one of which is the lack of access to straightforward, affordable advice.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe majority of our revenue is coming from employers who are buying MyEva for their employees,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, adding that most offer it for free as part of their wider staff benefits package.\par \par \uc2 Intriguingly, the firm plumped for a female chatbot because the financial advice profession is dominated by men and this was one way to \u8220\'20\'1Chelp address the balance\u8221\'20\'1D. The name Eva was chosen because it is defined on slang website Urban Dictionary as \u8220\'20\'1Ca person of extreme knowledge and high standards\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 After completing an online \u8220\'20\'1Cfinancial healthcheck\u8221\'20\'1D, Eva will suggest ways that users can achieve their financial goals.\par \par \uc2 Mr Firth says younger employees tend to have quite straightforward questions about pension top-ups and getting started in Isa investing which can be handled by the chatbot in language they understand (MyEva\u8217\'20\'19s slogan is \u8220\'20\'1Cno jargon, no pressure\u8221\'20\'1D).\par \par \uc2 If users meet conditions such as being debt-free and having cash savings, they can access investment advice \u8212\'20\'14 but only after having their risk appetite and capacity for loss assessed.\par \par \uc2 MyEva will then recommend passive funds from the Vanguard Lifestrategy range, chosen because they were considered appropriate for its target market of first-time, \u8220\'20\'1CMiddle Britain\u8221\'20\'1D investors.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf they want to talk to one of our telephone advisers and [invest in] something more complicated, they can pay for it,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Firth adds.\par \par \uc2 Conversations about retirement planning, decumulation and anything more complex will also go through to a human adviser. \u8220\'20\'1CIf Eva has something she is not sure about, she books an appointment for you with one of our phone advisers who pick up the conversation,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Firth adds.\par \par \uc2 He estimates that about 80 per cent of MyEva\u8217\'20\'19s clients are handled by the chatbot, with the rest eventually ending up speaking to a human adviser over the phone.\par \par \uc2 Employers will pick up these advice charges to a point, depending on their agreement, or individuals can pay up front. Services include a pensions \u8220\'20\'1Ctidy up\u8221\'20\'1D to review and potentially consolidate company pensions, charged from \u163\'00\'A3150 per pot. An investment planning report starts at \u163\'00\'A3150. More complex tasks such as inheritance tax planning cost \u163\'00\'A31,500.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are trying to show the market that a regulated chatbot can work and do a mixture of guidance and simple advice quite effectively. We hold ourselves to the standard that any adviser would hold themselves to.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Wealth Wizards, in which insurer LV= has a minority stake, has already signed up more than a dozen clients including \uc2 Unilever\uc2 , Calvin Klein and some \uc2 NHS\uc2  trusts.\par \par \uc2 It is also possible for individuals to subscribe to MyEva for \u163\'00\'A32 per month, although relatively few people have done so. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are not marketing this version as we are concentrating on employers for the time being.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Multiple options\par \par \uc2 A different approach is being taken by Multiply, a regulated advisory firm that gained \uc2 FCA\uc2  approval for its app in July. Already available on iOS, the Android launch is expected next year.\par \par \uc2 Multiply targets younger clients than traditional financial advisers \u8212\'20\'14 workers in their twenties, thirties and forties who have \u8220\'20\'1Cjust got on top of their cash flow\u8221\'20\'1D, according to chief executive Vivek Madlani.\par \par \uc2 Once users have downloaded the app, he says they are taken through \u8220\'20\'1Ca similar process to which an adviser goes through \u8212\'20\'14 we assess attitude to risk and capacity for loss, where a customer is in terms of their finances, what they are investing towards.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Madlani says Multiply\u8217\'20\'19s younger clients tend to be most interested in saving to buy their first home, but plenty are interested in pensions and investments. This is where the app\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cproduct engine\u8221\'20\'1D kicks in.\par \par \uc2 As well as savings tips, Multiply offers Isas, Sipps and general investment accounts and can recommend portfolios consisting of between one and three multi-asset passive funds \u8212\'20\'14 as with MyEva, \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Lifestrategy range features among the funds on offer.\par \par \uc2 In the future, Multiply aims to offer access to products including mortgages and income protection policies.\par \par \uc2 As well as providing advice to the mass market, Multiply also promises to do so for \u8220\'20\'1Cfree\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 though this is not quite as good as it sounds.\par \par \uc2 The company uses what advisers refer to as contingent charging model \u8212\'20\'14 the advice is effectively provided for free, but the adviser charges for implementation. So Multiply only gets paid if its clients go ahead with its recommendations.\par \par \uc2 Mr Madlani says this is clearly explained to users of the app, but he accepts there are limits to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -powered advice.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTo be honest, there is a boundary beyond which we don\u8217\'20\'19t want to accept the risks, such as final salary pension scheme transfers [or] buying an annuity. I think there should be a human element involved before pulling the trigger on something like that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 About 25 per cent of those who use the app are not considered to be suitable investors for a variety of reasons, for example, if they have high levels of debt. However, Multiply does not currently pass on their details to any third-party human advisers such as debt charities \u8212\'20\'14 something Mr Madlani says the company was looking to address.\par \par \uc2 The US dimension\par \par \uc2 Ramya Joseph, the founder and chief executive of Pefin, which claims to be the first company to offer AI advice in the world, is more bullish about the technology\u8217\'20\'19s ability.\par \par \uc2 The US company does not operate in the UK \u8212\'20\'14 though it is in discussions with potential partners to address this. Ms Joseph believes there are few personal finance scenarios that AI cannot handle, but says this would not necessarily mean the end of human advisers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAI can complement a human adviser and allow them to spend more time focusing on both the client relationship, as well as more specialised financial needs such as complex business and trust structures.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Nutmeg, one of the UK\u8217\'20\'19s largest online investment managers, is looking at how it can use AI to improve its nascent advice service launched late last year using human beings.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are a technology-led business and believe there is huge potential for AI to make advice more efficient and therefore make it possible to serve many more clients,\u8221\'20\'1D says Lisa Caplan, Nutmeg\u8217\'20\'19s head of financial advice.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn the future, there will be a greater role for \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which is already used to detect changes in behaviour such as excessive account log ins.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In fact, there could be an opportunity for \u8220\'20\'1Ctraditional\u8221\'20\'1D financial advice businesses to invest in AI to provide a cheaper service for parts of their business, with a human face attached.\par \par \uc2 Andy Thompson, chief executive of Quilter Financial Planning, the UK\u8217\'20\'19s second largest advice firm, says his company is investing in automating its systems.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn the US, AI is more advanced and they are moving away from the dichotomy of face-to-face advice versus robo-advice. A hybrid form of advice is becoming increasingly common, which is something I think the UK will also be embracing.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe power of technology to improve efficiency and lower costs both for advisers and their clients is immense. Ultimately, the relationship between an adviser is intimate one and cannot be replaced by AI.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Regulatory worries\par \par \uc2 Other commentators point out that advice chatbots are not replacing traditional advisers, but making it financially possible for regulated firms to serve a new and hitherto unadvised client base.\par \par \uc2 But regulators are already concerned that the boundaries between regulated financial advice and DIY investment platforms \u8212\'20\'14 where the risk is on the individual \u8212\'20\'14 are becoming blurred, which could put consumers at risk.\par \par \uc2 Wanda Goldwag, chairman of the Financial Services Consumer Panel, says she is \u8220\'20\'1Cconcerned that regulated advice is not being clearly distinguished from \u8216\'20\'18execution-only\u8217\'20\'19 transactions.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CConsumers need to know, when using robo-advice services, whether they will be protected by recourse to the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme when things go wrong,\u8221\'20\'1D she says, adding that there is a need for greater transparency on the costs and charges associated with advice.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FCA\uc2  declined to comment on whether it shared these concerns, but has previously highlighted \u8220\'20\'1Cweaknesses\u8221\'20\'1D in the way some automated robo advice services support vulnerable consumers, such as those who had recently suffered a bereavement.\par \par \uc2 Yet one of the risks that AI advisers themselves acknowledge is the possibility that if something goes wrong, it will go wrong for a lot of people.\par \par \uc2 Mr Madlani, who is himself a qualified adviser, says: \u8220\'20\'1CWe have put so much work into ensuring we have set up the right checks and balances into our advice engine. Ultimately I am not the guy who wants to go to jail for years for providing millions of people with unsuitable advice. It has taken us almost three years to launch, which says something.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Madlani points out that Multiply employs regulated financial advisers, but to check that the advice it is providing is suitable, not to advise its clients directly.\par \par \uc2 Ms Joseph says her company also spent years testing its advice model and employs human advisers to check its advice.\par \par \uc2 We need to talk\par \par \uc2 AI advice is currently confined to chatbots, but some predict it will soon come to life in a form clients can actually talk to at home via their smart speaker.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you talk to a chat interface, then it is not that big a step to get voice recognition and voice-to-text,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Firth of Wealth Wizards.\par \par \uc2 He adds that converting the spoken word to written text has benefits for digital financial advice firms because if everything the client says can be written down, you can store it and do a lot of analysis.\par \par \uc2 Ms Joseph agrees: \u8220\'20\'1CIn five to seven years it will be possible for consumers to widely accept automated advice as a service interacting with voice recognition technology.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She cited \uc2 Amazon\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Alexa and Apple\u8217\'20\'19s Siri as examples of how the public had come to accept talking to a machine.\par \par \uc2 But will younger clients be happy with this form of advice?\par \par \uc2 Adam O\u8217\'20\'19Brien, a 30-year-old data scientist from south London, falls squarely into the target market \u8212\'20\'14 he has accumulated cash savings, but has never considered investing them.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI really don\u8217\'20\'19t know what products are out there apart from the Isas or savings accounts from the mainstream banks, and the interest rates seem so low now that it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t seem worth the effort to spend too much time looking into it,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Instead, he has signed up to Multiply and is in the process of trying it out.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf the advice coming from pre-determined algorithms takes the risk of receiving advice from a less skilled or experienced adviser, or one just having an off day, then I have no issues with the lack of human oversight.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 However, the traditional advice industry isn\u8217\'20\'19t unduly worried by AI.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGiven the communication skills and empathy needed to fulfil the entire role of a professional financial adviser, it is unlikely that AI will be able to replicate this any time soon,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Keith Richards\uc2 , chief executive of the Personal Finance Society.\par \par \uc2 The services he stresses the robots cannot replicate are tellingly those that older and richer clients are prepared to pay for \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1Cunderstanding [a client\u8217\'20\'19s] goals for themselves and their wider family; how their finances fit in with their career; educating them about their investments and helping them understand how they are going to manage different risks.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For younger generations with less complex financial needs who are already comfortable asking Alexa to buy things for them, perhaps that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t matter.\par \par \uc2 Damian Fantato is deputy editor of FTAdviser\par \par \uc2 My brush with a digital adviser\par \par \uc2 My interaction with \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -generated advice started with a conversation during my lunch break with chirpy chatbot MyEva who used plenty of emojis to colour her text.\par \par \uc2 The chirpiness was slightly undercut when she provided me with terms and conditions and an \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  registration number \u8212\'20\'14 but it was a necessary step, as this app provides regulated advice.\par \par \uc2 After asking for my email address and if I wanted to receive promotional material in my inbox (I did not), Eva prompted me to start my \u8220\'20\'1Cfinancial health check\u8221\'20\'1D by asking me to click a button labelled \u8220\'20\'1CLet\u8217\'20\'19s do this!\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Essentially a fact find, I was asked questions on the chat stream about my employment and marital status, if I owned my own home, if I tended to spend more than I earn and whether I was in significant debt.\par \par \uc2 This generated a checklist, most of which wasn\u8217\'20\'19t rocket science \u8212\'20\'14 pay into a pension, build a savings buffer and then save towards buying my first home (if only it were that easy). There was also some stuff which might be less intuitive for some people, such as writing a will and checking who gets my death-in-service benefit.\par \par \uc2 The majority of MyEva users have the service provided free by the company they work for. As an individual user, if I wanted to access certain services \u8212\'20\'14 such as saving into a pension \u8212\'20\'14 I would have to sign up and pay \u163\'00\'A32 a month.\par \par \uc2 But the service to help me buy a home was free and, being a millennial, I was intrigued.\par \par \uc2 It transpires that Eva has \u8220\'20\'1Cteamed up\u8221\'20\'1D with mortgage broker Alexander Hall. After I provided details of my savings and a rough idea of how much a house was likely to cost me, Eva decided I would benefit from speaking to a broker and asked if she could pass my details on to them.\par \par \uc2 It turns out robots are not going to be replacing humans just yet.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191108efb8000ry\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Privacy is fast becoming an expensive and time-consuming legal problem for companies of all kinds. Protecting customer privacy is one way companies are seeking competitive advantage.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  hasn't complied fully with subpoenas and other requests for information about its privacy practices, according to the California attorney general in a lawsuit unveiled Wednesday. The tech company says it has provided thousands of pages of written responses and many more documents.\par \par \uc2 Also today: A New York medical center agrees to a $3 million settlement over patient privacy violations; Apple released details about how it handles privacy protections on its iPhones; and \uc2 IBM\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  released details about a cloud service that includes encryption and other security measures to guard banking data.\par \par \uc2 Privacy Investigation\par \par \uc2 California seeks to force \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to comply with subpoenas. California is investigating \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's privacy practices, the state's attorney general revealed Wednesday in a lawsuit that accuses the Silicon Valley tech giant of failing to adequately comply with information requests, the WSJ reports. California prosecutors began probing \uc2 Facebook\uc2  in 2018, shortly after the company said data from as many as 87 million of its users may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct British political consulting firm.\par \par \uc2 Looking for email: California said in its legal filing that it doesn't believe \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has searched the emails of either Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg or Chief Operating Officer \uc2 Sheryl Sandberg\uc2  in response to subpoenas. The office of Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that it issued a first round of subpoenas to \uc2 Facebook\uc2  on June 4, 2018, and waited more than a year for responses. A second round of information requests was issued this past June. In that case, the company didn't answer 19 of 27 written questions, gave only partial responses on six others and didn't provide any documents to six document requests.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  says it has complied with requests: "To date, we have provided thousands of pages of written responses and hundreds of thousands of documents," said Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local policy.\par \par \uc2 News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Big Number\par \par \uc2 $29 Million\par \par \uc2 Amount an employee of Nikkei America Inc. wired to a fraudster's account in September in response to an email message from someone posing as an executive of the Japanese media company. Nikkei said it is working with authorities in the U.S. and Hong Kong to investigate.\par \par \uc2 Huawei and 5G Security\par \par \uc2 Huawei founder says Chinese giant doesn't need the U.S. The Chinese telecom giant hasn't yet received any expressions of interest from U.S. companies to buy the intellectual property underpinning its 5G technology\u8212\'20\'14a workaround floated earlier this year after years of being blocked in the U.S., the WSJ reports. In an interview, Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei Huawei's 75-year-old founder, struck a defiant tone on the Trump administration's recent moves against the company, while also praising the U.S.'s entrepreneurial spirit.\par \par \uc2 No biggie: "We can survive very well without the U.S.," Mr. Ren said. "The China-U.S. trade talks are not something I'm concerned with." Mr. Ren said he would welcome a visit from President Trump now or after he has left office. "We would certainly give him a warm welcome," Mr. Ren said.\par \par \uc2 Context: In May the U.S. added Huawei to a Commerce Department "entity list," preventing many American suppliers from doing business with the Shenzhen-based company. Huawei, which last year bought $11 billion of technology from American suppliers\u8212\'20\'14including software from Alphabet and \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 , and chips from an array of manufacturers\u8212\'20\'14has moved to find backup sources, while also working on its own chips and software.\par \par \uc2 More Cyber News\par \par \uc2 Apple outlines iPhone privacy processes. The company issued papers for researchers and developers about how privacy is handled in its photo app, Safari web browser, location-based services and a sign-in process for third-party apps, Reuters reports. Apple's \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology helps guard against the creation of fake accounts and other systems for preventing developers from bypassing safeguards.\par \par \uc2 IBM\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  collaborate on cloud, security tools. The companies are building a public-cloud computing service for banks that includes automated security tools and top-level encryption, the WSJ's CIO Journal reports. The service, unveiled Wednesday, is intended to protect banking data. "Even people at \uc2 IBM\uc2  with deep access to the cloud will not have access to the key" to unlock a bank's encrypted data, said \uc2 Arvind Krishna\uc2 , IBM's senior vice president for the cloud.\par \par \uc2 New York-based medical center settles privacy case. University of Rochester Medical Center said it will pay $3 million to the \uc2 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  to settle a probe into violations of patient privacy, Becker's Hospital Review reports. The medical center reported the theft of an unencrypted flash drive in 2013 and an unencrypted laptop four years later. Each contained sensitive personal data. An investigation by the Office for Civil Rights at \uc2 HHS\uc2  found inadequate security and risk management procedures.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20191107efb700001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

We're lucky here in Manhattan that the season so far has been mild compared with other parts of the country. In New England, snow lurks in the forecast while parts of the Intermountain region and upper Midwest have already been through the deep freeze treatment. But on to business.\par \par \uc2 Today we have a look at how the sluggish deal market has provided a kind of blessing in disguise as WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming reports that one of the biggest U.S. public pensions has saved millions in expenses on carried interest. As we have reported elsewhere, top executives at \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2  expect the M&A drought to begin lifting next year.\par \par \uc2 But at least one deal looks like it will conclude sooner than that, as WSJ Pro's Laura Kreutzer reports that the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  has given early clearance to \uc2 Kelso & Co\uc2 .'s acquisition of a couple of marine insurers. As S&P Global Market Intelligence noted this week, deal volume\u8212\'20\'14which fell to a six-year low in the third quarter\u8212\'20\'14was aggravated over the summer by geopolitical events, from trade tensions, slowing growth and the dragging Brexit debate to the destruction of Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure and even a market crash in Argentina. As we keep our fingers crossed, we have collected a full plate of news below, so please, jump in...\par \par \uc2 Today's Top Stories\par \par \uc2 Calstrs\uc2  Carried-Interest Payments Fall as Private-Equity Exits Slow\par \par \uc2 The pension fund for California schoolteachers saw its payments to private-equity managers decline last year, one of several recent signs that buyout firms are having more trouble profitably selling investments. The \uc2 California State Teachers' Retirement System\uc2 , which at $238 billion is the second-largest public pension fund in the U.S., reported that its investment costs fell 14% in 2018 from the year before, mainly because of a 36% decline in the amount of overall carried interest it paid, to $463 million, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming reports. The report is the latest sign that successful private-equity exits are becoming harder to find. For pensions like \uc2 Calstrs\uc2 , the trend\u8212\'20\'14if it continues\u8212\'20\'14would likely reduce both investment costs and returns.\par \par \uc2 Kelso & Co\uc2 .

Some of the company's offerings use AI technology to perform tasks such as scanning documents for errors.\par \par \uc2 Numerous startups are attempting to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-providers-look-to-ai-to-process-home-loans-faster-11552899212"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 introduce AI }}}\uc2  to streamline the mortgage and homebuying process, which is notorious for including heavy paperwork. These startups are building platforms for the parties concerned\u8212\'20\'14lenders, titleholders and notaries\u8212\'20\'14to share documents and reduce the time borrowers spend waiting for a mortgage approval.\par \par \uc2 Snapdocs' new Series B round was led by F-Prime Capital, with David Jegen, managing partner of F-Prime's Tech Fund, joining the company's board. Previous investors Sequoia Capital, which led Snapdocs' Series A, as well as Freestyle Capital and Founders Fund returned for the new round.\par \par \uc2 The company has raised about $43 million since it was founded in 2013 by Aaron King.\par \par \uc2 Snapdocs processes roughly 750,000 mortgage closings a year, licensing its software and charging closing transaction fees. Lenders, titleholders and notaries can use Snapdocs' platform for a variety of functions, including managing documents, scheduling loan signings and communications.\par \par \uc2 The startup's AI functions can detect errors in paperwork, which often varies between states and lenders, F-Prime's Mr. Jegen said.\par \par \uc2 Snapdocs fits into F-Prime's broader interest in real-estate technology, Mr. Jegen said. There are opportunities for investors as more aspects of the real-estate sector move online, he said. In particular, he is interested in startups working on automated real-estate investing technology that allows for "buying homes like traders are buying stocks."\par \par \uc2 F-Prime's previous investments in the real-estate sector include home financing startup Real Estate Equity Exchange Inc., commonly known as Unison.\par \par \uc2 Write to Marc Vartabedian at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:marc.vartabedian@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 marc.vartabedian@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20191107efb700001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Mr. Govil said SoftBank hasn't finalized outside commitments for the second Vision Fund.\par \par \uc2 * Limited partners wanted to "see how the WeWork situation unfolded" before making additional investments, he said. "Nothing's been locked in yet," Mr. Govil said. The company previously said it had pledges of more than $100 billion.\par \par \uc2 * The Vision Fund has drawn scrutiny for its check sizes and also for its investment strategy. Mr. Govil said his fund doesn't use large checks as a means to success. "There was never the belief that more money would make a company successful," he said.\par \par \uc2 * The Vision Fund reported nearly a $9 billion operating loss\u8212\'20\'14its first\u8212\'20\'14for its latest quarter on Wednesday. Overall, SoftBank reported a $6.4 billion net loss in the latest quarter, and took billions of dollars in write-downs of the value of it its investments in WeWork, Uber and about 20 other companies. "This is clearly a challenging and difficult quarter for us," Mr. Govil said.\par \par \uc2 * Still, the Vision Fund isn't changing how it values startups. "Our valuations are in line with accounting guidelines," he said, referring to international accounting rules that help companies determine asset values.\par \par \uc2 Animal organ donors. A pair of corporate venture arms are joining a $100 million bet on technology to enable animal organs to be transplanted into humans, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Fresenius Medical Care Ventures is leading an investment into eGenesis Inc., a startup seeking to use gene editing to clear technical hurdles to using animal organs in humans. Leaps by Bayer, the venture group of German life-sciences company Bayer, joined the financing.\par \par \uc2 Kalanick's new venture. Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund has pumped $400 million into Travis Kalanick's new company CloudKitchens, the Journal's Rory Jones and Rolfe Winkler report, citing people familiar with the situation. The deal could value the operator of so-called ghost kitchens at about $5 billion and reunites the former Uber chief with one of his biggest backers. Mr. Kalanick has kept many aspects of CloudKitchens a secret.\par \par \uc2 Mortgage startup. Real-estate technology startup Snapdocs Inc. has raised $25 million to further improve \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  on its mortgage processing platform, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. Numerous startups are attempting to introduce AI to streamline the mortgage and homebuying process, which is notorious for including heavy paperwork.\par \par \uc2 Health data. Behind \uc2 Google\uc2 's $2.1 billion deal for wearables maker \uc2 Fitbit Inc\uc2 . is the search giant's dream to become a major player in health data after a failed attempt to establish a foothold in it years ago, the Journal's Sarah E. Needleman and Rob Copeland report. Analysts say it's logical that \uc2 Fitbit\uc2  and others would find ways to make money from the data by partnering with health-care companies to monitor chronic conditions among users and developing new health-care services, among other methods.\par \par \uc2 Ballot box. A regulatory crackdown is on the way for \uc2 Airbnb Inc\uc2 . and other similar short-term rental companies in Jersey City, N.J., the Journal's Joseph De Avila reports. Voters in Jersey City overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure Tuesday by a margin of 69% to 31% to beef up rules for operating short-term rental properties in the city. It was a blow to \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 , which had spent more than $4 million opposing the measure, flooding the television airwaves with commercials and inundating residents with mailers.\par \par \uc2 Advertisement\par \par \uc2 [ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://li.wsj.net/imp?s=174686&li=406&e=isaac.taylor@wsj.com&p=xidhrtd"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://li.wsj.net/imp?s=174686&li=406&e=isaac.taylor@wsj.com&p=xidhrtd }}}\uc2 ]\par \par \uc2 [ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://li.wsj.net/imp?s=430934&li=406&e=isaac.taylor@wsj.com&p=xidhrtd"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://li.wsj.net/imp?s=430934&li=406&e=isaac.taylor@wsj.com&p=xidhrtd }}}\uc2 ]\par \par \uc2 [ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://li.wsj.net/imp?s=562004&li=406&e=isaac.taylor@wsj.com&p=xidhrtd"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://li.wsj.net/imp?s=562004&li=406&e=isaac.taylor@wsj.com&p=xidhrtd }}}\uc2 ]\par \par \uc2 [Forward icon.]\par \par \uc2 Share this email with a friend.\par \par \uc2 Forward\par \par \uc2 [Friend icon.]\par \par \uc2 Forwarded this email by a friend?\par \par \uc2 Sign Up Here\par \par \uc2 Exits\par \par \uc2 Social trading and investment platform eToro Ltd. acquired Delta, which provides crypto portfolio management tools, for an undisclosed amount.

The retailer had invested much of that in bonds "in case we run into trouble" but had recently made a number of venture capital investments and acquisitions.\par \par \uc2 "Ingvar was always talking about the long-term needs and saving money for when you need it. Partly, we need it now as our business is transforming," he said. "We have made venture investments in interesting companies, particularly in sustainability and digital."\par \par \uc2 Karl-Johan Persson, \uc2 H&M\uc2 's chief executive, said his venture capital investments had been a "good financial journey but for us the most important thing is they are [businesses] we believe that can really help the company".\par \par \uc2 H&M\uc2  had invested a lot in "sustainable material innovations" such as Renewcell, a Swedish start-up that produces clothes from recycled textiles. Mr Persson said: "It will not change us now, but in the future I think it will do a great amount of good for the world, and hopefully also for the company. I believe many of the conventional materials today will be replaced by these sustainable materials with quality and prices that are as good or better."\par \par \uc2 H&M\uc2  has also invested in companies developing new business models such as Thread, a menswear fashion start-up that uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and personal stylists to offer tailored recommendations to shoppers, and Sellpy, an ecommerce platform for second-hand clothes.\par \par \uc2 Ingka has gone beyond mere venture investments by making its first acquisitions, snapping up \uc2 TaskRabbit\uc2 , the oddjobs service, and Traemand, the kitchen installer, in the past three years. The flat-pack furniture retailer expected to make four to five venture capital investments a year as well as the occasional outright acquisition.\par \par \uc2 "In many aspects, we are also learning from the collaborations to help us ... as we transform our business to be even more accessible, convenient, and sustainable," it added.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020191107efb700078\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Many have debated why the market went wrong so fast.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 US Federal Reserve\uc2  was so spooked, it didn't wait for answers before stepping in.\par \par \uc2 Its gross cumulative support for the market which allows banks and investors to borrow cash in exchange for Treasuries and other high-quality collateral will top $11.5tn by the end of January. The Fed didn't just stabilise the repo market; now, it is the repo market.\par \par \uc2 Repos were once the liquidity-providing plumbing of the system. Now they have taken on another role: post-crisis rules demand that financial institutions hold far bigger balances of safe assets at a time when yields on such assets are low or negative. The only way to comply while eking out a profit is to squeeze each dime out of safe-asset holdings through repo market financing. Borrowers use high-speed funding flows from repo transactions to boost profitability through derivatives trading and other higher-return activities.\par \par \uc2 This transformation in repos was presaged by the equity market. The Fed's bond-buying and rate-cutting programme initially supported the macroeconomic recovery. But extension of quantitative easing changed its nature from an output-boosting policy to an equity-market stimulus. Yield-chasing became a market imperative, creating strong incentives for participants that hold safe assets such as Treasuries to boost returns by leveraging their positions through the repo market. None of the rules demanding large safe-asset holdings is necessarily wrong, but each has consequences that the Fed failed to anticipate. At the same time that the demand for repos grew, banks' capacity to meet the demand ebbed. Tougher post-crisis requirements made big banks safer but no bank is willing to enter the repo market if that jeopardises compliance with intraday liquidity standards or the broader rule book.\par \par \uc2 Exposing the repo risks in such dramatic fashion would ordinarily lead participants to run for cover. Instead, the market is so vibrant, the Fed has had continuously to increase sums with which it backs overnight and even longer-term deals. The explanation for this insouciance? De facto nationalisation.\par \par \uc2 Desperate to keep short-term rates in its desired range, the Fed chose not to use its backstop the discount window, where it provides higher-cost loans to banks backed by eligible collateral or other emergency-liquidity powers. Using these transparent fallbacks would have allowed the repo rate to settle in an orderly and perhaps smaller marketplace. Instead, the Fed opened its vault. What should have been a learning experience is a powerful incentive for moral hazard. Speculative bets can be made with the understanding that taxpayers, through the central bank, will bail out bad calls. The old guarantee of the Greenspan put stabilising equity prices is buttressed by a Powell promise: fear not, in the dollar-based global funding market, the Fed is there for you. The central bank was once supposed to be lender of last resort, backing banks which had no other way of funding. The safety net was designed so that banks could take households' deposits and turn them into savings that enabled wealth accumulation and loans to back growth. But after 2008, the Fed became market-maker of last resort, lowering rates whenever equities trembled. Now it is market lender of last resort, too.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, its current repo backstop puts the Fed in a supporting role it steps in only after primary lenders step back. The market could run without the Fed, but it doesn't because lenders love having this backstop and the central bank is always there to provide it.\par \par \uc2 The Fed also offers reverse repos, a longstanding operation designed to keep market interest rates in the central bank's target range, no matter the risks participants take. The central bank is considering making its repo operations permanent through a standing facility. In for a penny, in for a pound, and if you are a central bank, in forever.\par \par \uc2 But with central banks providing a backstop for both equity and funding markets, what's next? Some governors have decided they must add digital currencies to their payment systems, not just to protect the globe from \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's Libra but as a tool that might better transmit monetary policy. It could curtail lending, but some central banks have the cure: they would lend too, at least for projects such as sustainable energy that suit policymakers' idea of what constitutes useful economic activity. The market's trains would run on time. But central bankers not market forces would dictate who got on and who was pushed off.\par \par \uc2 Karen Petrou\uc2  is managing partner at \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  is managing partner at\par \par \uc2 The Greenspan put is buttressed by a Powell promise.

"They're both going to move faster," he said.

The trend is driven by a shortage of in-house cybersecurity experts and startups' use of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to address specific problems, he said.\par \par \uc2 When considering pitches from startups, corporate cybersecurity professionals should ask for details about security practices, including how long it takes the company to patch security problems after receiving alerts from software and hardware providers, Mr. Smith said.\par \par \uc2 France-based power-equipment supplier \uc2 Schneider Electric SE\uc2  tests technologies from security startups for one to two years before deciding whether to deploy them, Chief Innovation Officer \uc2 Emmanuel Lagarrigue\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 The company works with many cybersecurity startups to solve complex security issues in internet-connected industrial devices, he said: "One startup will solve one type of problem, but you don't find a startup that will solve all the problems you need to solve in the Internet of Things."\par \par \uc2 Cybersecurity startups seeking to stand out in a sea of vendor pitches might have an advantage if they received funding from \uc2 In-Q-Tel Inc\uc2 ., the venture-capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, said \uc2 Rashmi Gopinath\uc2 , managing director at M12, \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 .'s venture-capital fund. \uc2 In-Q-Tel\uc2  vets cybersecurity startups that provide services to federal agencies, which might help to convince companies that their technology is trustworthy, she said.\par \par \uc2 Referrals go a long way for corporate CISOs considering products from a startup, Mr. Shah said. They might come from cybersecurity executives at other companies, investors or employees within a CISO's team, he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lagarrigue said \uc2 Schneider Electric\uc2  often receives referrals about cybersecurity startups through industry forums and associations. Some of his staff speak to counterparts at competing companies about startups, he added.\par \par \uc2 Startups can boost their credibility with potential enterprise customers if they proactively offer information about the types of sensitive data they have access to and how they protect it, Ms. Gopinath said.\par \par \uc2 "It's always really valuable for a startup to\u8230\'20\'26be upfront about what they're doing to ensure data security and to ensure they're not at risk of being breached or hacked," Ms. Gopinath said.\par \par \uc2 Companies processing health-related data in the U.S., for example, should provide certification that they comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa, Ms. Gopinath said. If startups handle personal data in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , she said, they should tell potential customers which tools they use to comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.\par \par \uc2 Cybersecurity experts should ask startups whether they depend on cloud providers to secure data, Mr. Smith said. If startups don't have a strategy for how they provide additional security, that is a red flag, he said. Under the EU data-protection law, any company that holds EU residents' personal information is responsible for protecting it.\par \par \uc2 Write to Catherine Stupp at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20191106efb600001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Fair Isaac Corp\uc2 ., creator of the widely used FICO credit score, on Wednesday is set to unveil two \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools designed to help banks authenticate customers and reduce fraud.\par \par \uc2 FICO is known for selling credit scores that help financial firms make lending decisions, but two-thirds of its revenue comes from selling software for business functions, including fraud detection. The new offerings are powered by technology from EZMCOM Inc., a company that FICO acquired for an undisclosed amount in August but didn't announce until Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 One of the new tools lets banks authenticate new customers, while the other is for existing customers. Over time, FICO plans to market the tools to retailers and telecommunications companies.\par \par \uc2 Many businesses already use multifactor authentication as an extra layer of security on top of a username and password. Users are prompted to enter an additional piece of information, such as a code sent to their phones, to gain access to an account. While the method is effective, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/multifactor-authentication-can-stop-hacks-but-also-annoy-employees-11568799001"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 compliance is low }}}\uc2 . Only 30% of people use multifactor authentication to log into accounts, according to a poll of 1,223 adults in the U.S. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.chubb.com/us-en/individuals-families/agent-marketing/online-you-protected/pdf/Chubb_Cyber_Survey.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 published in September }}}\uc2  by \uc2 Chubb Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The need for authentication that is "frictionless" is growing, said Liz Lasher, vice president of fraud and financial crimes at FICO.\par \par \uc2 "Right now it's an everything-mobile world," Ms. Lasher said. "So when you think about the need to digitally onboard customers seamlessly without any face-to-face verification, there's an element of being able to prove, secure and establish a digital identity. And this technology allows us to do that."\par \par \uc2 The first tool, FICO Identity Proofing, is meant to make it easier to authenticate new customers. The bank asks a customer to take a picture of his or her government ID as well as a selfie. The software scans the ID to make sure the hologram and data formatting is consistent with other IDs for that jurisdiction. It uses facial-recognition technology to compare what is known as a facial-point map between the selfie and the ID. That allows the technology to work even if a person's appearance changes, such as through weight gain or a hairstyle change.\par \par \uc2 Banks can use the second tool, the FICO Authentication Suite, to verify customers' identities during certain activities, such as logging into a banking app or transferring a large sum of money. On top of the usual multifactor authentication, the tool can add extra layers of security: biometric authentication, such as facial recognition or voice recognition, and behavioral authentication.\par \par \uc2 That latter component can track behavior patterns such as how fast a person types or the mobile device and language setting used for logging in. \b \highlight22\uc2 Machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms recognize patterns over time and, if the system suspects something awry, the software can prompt additional verification.\par \par \uc2 Clients can customize which FICO Authentication Suite features to use and how to use them, Ms. Lasher said, including whether to store facial-recognition data locally on the device or on a remote server.\par \par \uc2 FICO executives said EZMCOM has about 40 clients, mostly banks outside the U.S., serving about 60 million customers. Pricing for the new products will depend on usage and whether the purchase is bundled with other FICO tools, the company said.\par \par \uc2 Authentication software is a multibillion-dollar market, with players including \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Okta Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Symantec Corp\uc2 ., and HID Global Corp., said David Mahdi, a senior research director at Gartner Inc. But FICO might have an edge with financial institutions given its relationships in that sector, he added: "You could very well see financial institutions say, \u8216\'20\'18Well, we already do a lot of business with [FICO]. Why are we using these other narrowly focused vendors?'"\par \par \uc2 Write to Jared Council at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jared.council@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jared.council@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROAI20191106efb600001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

A target of their resentment is the territory's property tycoons, who with the help of a pliant local government have for years kept housing supply far lower than demand, amassing land holdings but developing them at a rate that ensured rising prices.\par \par \uc2 That formula is now at risk, with even Beijing starting to criticise the most prominent developers. But while neighbouring Shenzhen gives rise to some of the world's most innovative companies, helping its economy eclipse that of the former British colony, few Hong Kong businesses are trying to adapt to tomorrow's world.\par \par \uc2 Even Beijing is starting to criticise the In seminars on the "Greater Bay Area", the megaproject to create a vast business and innovation hub by linking southern Chinese cities with a combined population of 70m, it has little more to offer than its capability in providing buildings for incubators although there are not many Hong Kong start-ups to occupy them.\par \par \uc2 most prominent developers An exception is Nan Fung, which is putting its success on the line by forging an entirely new path for itself.\par \par \uc2 Property was not always the only route to prosperity in the city. When millions of immigrants arrived in the wake of the 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese civil war, the wealthiest of the new residents were industrialists from the eastern cities of Shanghai and Ningbo. These manufacturers transformed the colony's economy, building the city's fortunes along with their own. Among them was Chen Din Hwa who fled to Hong Kong in 1949, established a series of textile mills and, five years later, founded Nan Fung.\par \par \uc2 The textile mills were shuttered just over a decade ago, long after they became uneconomic, in part because Mr Chen was reluctant to move his operations to the mainland as costs rose in his adopted home. Some of the buildings that housed the operations have been turned into a museum and a centre to encourage technological innovation in fashion. And the company is now known primarily as a property group.\par \par \uc2 Nan Fung is one of a group of developers that has been marginalised over time as the biggest including Cheung Kong, Henderson Land, New World Development and Sun Hung Kai became ever more dominant.\par \par \uc2 Now the third generation of the family is trying to change the group's identity for the third time by using its capital to buy into the entirely new field of life sciences.\par \par \uc2 property group. Nan Fung is buying into the entirely new field "We started thinking about what should be next," says Vincent Cheung, the Nan Fung managing director and chief operating officer who is spearheading the shift. It initially spent $1.5bn acquiring expertise, first investing in funds five years ago and then establishing its own venture capital funds in 2017.\par \par \uc2 of life sciences Nan Fung has invested in 45 companies and 27 funds to date, as well as its own funds operating out of Shanghai and San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 The dramatic switch in focus came after the family decided to bring in an outsider as chairman, hiring Antony Leung, whose career has included stints as a banker, finance secretary in the Hong Kong government and, most recently, chairman of Blackstone's China operations.\par \par \uc2 It was Mr Leung who recommended that Nan Fung change course. "China was an entirely clean slate," Mr Cheung says. "But AI and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  give China a competitive advantage."\par \par \uc2 Nan Fung increasingly resembles US private equity firms such as \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2  whose founders embrace philanthropy, writing huge cheques to life sciences, but also invest through their family offices and make biotech part of their core buyout businesses. It helps that the DH Chen foundation, Nan Fung's largest shareholder, is not listed.\par \par \uc2 "Especially in young volatile markets like China, you need long-term, patient capital," says \uc2 Peter Bisgaard\uc2 , who is in charge of the business's US portfolio. "If the market dips you need ample reserves."\par \par \uc2 Eight of Nan Fung's portfolio companies have already gone public, he adds. Whether biotech will be as profitable as property remains to be seen but at least Nan Fung is now focusing on a public good.\par \par \uc2 henny.sender@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Even Beijing is starting to criticise the most prominent developers\par \par \uc2 Property group Nan Fung is buying into the entirely new field of life sciences\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020191106efb6000a9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 HONG KONG -- \uc2 AstraZeneca PLC\uc2  plans to raise up to $1 billion for a new fund that would invest in Chinese health-care startups, making it the latest drug giant to place a bet on the world's second-largest pharmaceuticals market.\par \par \uc2 The fund -- a joint venture between \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  and a Chinese investment bank -- has drawn interest from investors such as Sequoia Capital, the drugmaker's chief executive, \uc2 Pascal Soriot\uc2 , said in an interview. The fund plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million this year, and as much as $1 billion over four years.\par \par \uc2 A Sequoia spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Soriot said \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  is separately building a new research center and an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  lab, both in Shanghai, to develop drugs for diseases that are more widespread in China. \uc2 Johnson & Johnson\uc2  and \uc2 Novartis AG\uc2  have opened similar Shanghai-based centers in recent years.\par \par \uc2 "I think that every multinational I know" is eyeing China, Mr. Soriot said. U.S. drugmaker \uc2 Amgen Inc\uc2 . last week said it would pay $2.7 billion in cash for a 20% stake in Beijing-based \uc2 BeiGene Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For years, foreign drugmakers were locked out of selling their most lucrative drugs in China. But a host of new policy measures there has opened the door for the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies. China is approving nongeneric drugs at a record pace, particularly those to treat cancer, while slashing import duties and placing some drugs on a national reimbursement list.\par \par \uc2 China revenue has exploded at foreign drug companies. In the first quarter of 2019, AstraZeneca for the first time earned more revenue there than in Europe, making China its second-largest market after the U.S., according to Mr. Soriot. \uc2 Merck & Co\uc2 . last week reported that third-quarter China sales grew by 90%.\par \par \uc2 Beijing has spent the past decade encouraging homegrown innovation. It set up a state-run program that lured back many Western-trained Chinese scientists, poured billions of dollars into technology parks dedicated to biotech startups and granted conditional approvals to promising local drugs.\par \par \uc2 Chinese biotechs focusing on innovative products have flourished under those policies, attracting investors at home and abroad. Private-equity and venture-capital funds last year poured more than $17 billion into China's life sciences sector, up from $1 billion in 2013, according to Shanghai-based consultancy \uc2 ChinaBio\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Flush with cash, Chinese biotechs are increasingly recruiting U.S. talent and setting up offices from Greater Boston to Silicon Valley. The first innovative Chinese drug -- a \uc2 BeiGene\uc2  cancer treatment -- could be approved in the U.S. as early as next year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Soriot said he wants \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  to be part of China's growth. The life-sciences fund -- a first for the company -- will invest in areas ranging from traditional drug development to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  in China.\par \par \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2  also is interested in partnerships with companies the fund invests in, Mr. Soriot said. \uc2 Eli Lilly & Co\uc2 ., Merck and J&J have struck multimillion-dollar deals to license experimental Chinese drugs in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Indianapolis-based \uc2 Lilly\uc2  carved out a venture-capital fund focused on investing in Asia in 2008. The majority of the fund's investments are in China, according to a Lilly Asia Ventures partner.\par \par \uc2 China has been a bright spot for \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2 , which returned to growth last year for the first time since 2014. While its overall sales rose 18% in the third quarter from a year earlier, its sales in China grew 40%.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Soriot expects \uc2 AstraZeneca\uc2 's China sales growth to soften in the fourth quarter, as hospitals switch to Chinese copies of old multinational drugs. Beijing has been raising standards for domestic drugmakers, closing the gap in quality with multinationals. Earlier this year, the government rolled out a policy aimed at getting large public hospitals to switch to Chinese generics over multinational drugs.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Soriot says he expects China to remain the company's second-largest market. "What the China team is wondering is, when can they be No. 1?" he said.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\jpegblip\picw531\pich480\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7965\pichgoal7200

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 . have teamed up to develop a public-cloud computing service for banks, which have been reluctant to store customers' financial data outside their in-house systems.\par \par \uc2 The tool, unveiled Wednesday, features measures designed to meet the banking sector's regulatory and compliance requirements, \uc2 IBM\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  officials said. They include automated security tools and top-level encryption\u8212\'20\'14a process of preventing unauthorized access by converting data into code.\par \par \uc2 "Even people at \uc2 IBM\uc2  with deep access to the cloud will not have access to the key" to unlock a bank's encrypted data, said \uc2 Arvind Krishna\uc2 , IBM's senior vice president for the cloud.\par \par \uc2 The two companies have been working on the project for more than a year.\par \par \uc2 With a public cloud, businesses rent computer capacity from third-party providers including \uc2 IBM\uc2 , \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and others. Unlike a company's own private cloud, a public cloud is shared by other businesses. Mr. Krishna says he hopes the move catches the attention of other banks in the months ahead.\par \par \uc2 An important benefit of public-cloud computing is cutting the cost of running on-premise data centers and servers, Mr. Krishna said. A public cloud also offers more storage and the flexibility to access a wider range of applications and emerging technologies, such as blockchain and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said AI could enable banks to speed up lending decisions, such as mortgage applications, by quickly parsing a range of applicants' financial data.\par \par \uc2 Most banks have been hesitant to shift payments and other back-end systems to public-cloud services, in part due to concerns over security and data privacy.\par \par \uc2 That is giving less-regulated financial-technology upstarts an edge over banks in online payments, digital lending and investing, and other fast-growing markets.\par \par \uc2 Venmo, a digital money-transfer service operated by \uc2 PayPal Holdings Inc\uc2 ., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmo-has-40-million-users-outnumbering-most-big-banks-11556142906"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reported more than 40 million active users}}}\uc2  for the first three months of 2019. Over the same period, \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  reported 37 million active digital users, while \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . counted 29.8 million. Among large U.S. banks, only \uc2 JPMorgan Chase & Co\uc2 . surpassed Venmo, reporting 51 million digital users for the first quarter.\par \par \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  said the move to a public cloud is part of a plan launched in 2012 aimed at paring down the use of its own data centers and servers.\par \par \uc2 As of October, the bank is running 80% of its IT workloads in its private cloud, cutting the number of on-premise servers to 70,000 from 200,000 seven years ago. It operates 23 data centers, down from 60 in 2012. The bank said it now spends $2.1 billion less per year on infrastructure than it did in 2012. It now plans to gradually shift many of these workloads into the public cloud.\par \par \uc2 Cathy Bessant\uc2 , the bank's chief operations and technology officer, said the move to \uc2 IBM\uc2 's public-cloud service is "one of the most important collaborations in the financial services industry cloud space," according to a statement.\par \par \uc2 Write to Angus Loten at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:angus.loten@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 angus.loten@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020191106efb6000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The company's software helps merchants secure their payment systems and guard against fraud in online commerce while improving customer experience and minimizing sales lost to payment failures.\par \par \uc2 Growth-equity investor Winslow Capital Management and mutual fund giant \uc2 Fidelity Management & Research Co\uc2 . also participated in the deal. In addition to the new investors, firms that previously backed \uc2 Riskified\uc2  also contributed to the Series E funding round, including Qumra Capital, Pitango Venture Capital and Entr\u233\'00\'E9e Capital, a spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 Riskified\uc2 , founded in Tel Aviv in 2013, has developed its products using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms based on analysis of millions of e-commerce transactions. The company says its products help prevent payment failures and make customer verification easier and less annoying to shoppers, while also helping weed out phony buyers.\par \par \uc2 While e-commerce fraud is expected to cost retailers $6.4 billion annually by 2021, false declines, where valid transactions are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent, are projected to cost retailers $443 billion in lost sales each year, according to recent research from Aite Group and Miami-based ClearSale LLC.\par \par \uc2 Fraudulent transactions cost online retailers $2.94 for each $1 in such sales, according to a LexisNexis study released last year. The study cited surging incidents involving fraud tied to alternative transaction methods and increased "botnet activity." Costs are even higher for digital products sold online, the study said.\par \par \uc2 As a percentage of revenue, fraud accounted for almost 2.4% of 2018 e-commerce sales, LexisNexis said, up from about 2.2% in 2017. For retailers, fraud accounted for 1.8% of overall sales last year, up from nearly 1.6% the year before.\par \par \uc2 The study also said a major source of transaction friction came from verifying customer identities, calling it a challenge for online retailers that sell digital goods such as media, games and digital images. Newer payment methods add to the difficulties, it said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ted Bunker at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ted.bunker@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ted.bunker@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20191105efb500001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

However, \uc2 Ted Chung\uc2 , chief executive of the credit card business and Hyundai Capital, the carmaker's automotive finance unit, told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  that his preference would be for the listing to be deferred until 2021 to reach a "more favourable IPO price".\par \par \uc2 Mr Chung would not be drawn on pricing other than to say the valuation "may be more" than the $2.1bn reported in October. "We will be IPOready before the end of 2020. However, it doesn't mean that we will do it before the end of 2020," he said.\par \par \uc2 Under Mr Chung the company has increased its share of the country's credit card market from 1.7 per cent to 14.3 per cent. But it has struggled at home and its operating profit last year shrank 22 per cent to Won202bn ($174m). As a result, Hyundai Card is seeking to expand offshore. Last week it sealed a deal to buy half of Vietnam's retail bank \uc2 Finance Company Limited\uc2  For Community for $41.9m. It is in talks about a venture in Thailand, and plans to push into Indonesia and Malaysia.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr Chung believes a bigger gain will come from the launch next year of a new AI-based "engine", developed in-house for $300m. From 2020, Hyundai will "drop the concept of market segmentation" and tailor offers for each customer using thousands of data points processed by the system, he said.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Depository Trust & Clearing Corp\uc2 ., one of the largest clearinghouses in the U.S., has named a new chief information officer as it works to modernize systems critical to the clearing and settlement of securities transactions.\par \par \uc2 Lynn Bishop, previously DTCC's chief development officer, took on the CIO role last week. She reports to Chief Executive Michael Bodson and manages a staff of 3,500.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Bishop, who joined the New York-based company in 2004, succeeds Robert Garrison, who has assumed the role of managing director of technology until he retires in February.\par \par \uc2 The new CIO said her priorities will include upgrading underlying systems to ensure that post-trade market infrastructure is functioning smoothly.\par \par \uc2 "We continue to explore how technologies like distributed ledger technology, robotics, cloud and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , along with enhanced processes, can enable us to deliver increased stability and resiliency to protect the marketplace and investors," she told CIO Journal in an email.\par \par \uc2 The company {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-backs-blockchain-for-savings-on-derivatives-1483979438"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 has been testing}}}\uc2  the use of distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchain, for its Trade Information Warehouse to increase efficiency of derivative trades and lower costs and risks for banks and other users of the system. DTCC is moving the system from a mainframe to a cloud-based distributed ledger network.\par \par \uc2 DTCC {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dtcc.com/dtcc-connection/articles/2018/july/26/dtccs-journey-of-cloud-enlightenment"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 has already moved}}}\uc2  some operations and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to cloud services including \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2 , highlighting a shift from a mainframe-oriented technology culture.\par \par \uc2 DTCC facilitates the exchange of securities such as equities and bonds. The company said that last year, it processed securities transactions valued at about $1.85 quadrillion. It also provides data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  services.\par \par \uc2 The CIO role at DTCC is important in maintaining the stability of the company's technology infrastructure, which is critical to the U.S. financial markets, said \uc2 Larry Tabb\uc2 , founder and research chairman of \uc2 Tabb Group\uc2 , a New York-based capital-markets research and advisory company.\par \par \uc2 For a company like DTCC, new initiatives typically require a lot of testing before being turned on, Mr. Tabb said. "It's the exact opposite" of Silicon Valley's mantra to move fast and break things, he added.\par \par \uc2 Another key initiative for Ms. Bishop is the creation of developer marketplaces for employees and clients.\par \par \uc2 The internal marketplace will provide a one-stop shop for DTCC developers to access reusable assets, applications, shared services and other content for their projects.\par \par \uc2 The external marketplace will give clients, such as dealers and brokers, access to a single, simplified portal to the company's data and services.\par \par \uc2 "It's taking the digital platform model of \uc2 Netflix\uc2  or \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and applying it to the processing of financial transactions," Ms. Bishop said.\par \par \uc2 As part of its technology-modernization effort, DTCC is building a strategy for application programming interfaces, or APIs, pieces of software that enable apps, platforms and systems to connect with each other and share data.\par \par \uc2 Write to Agam Shah at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:agam.shah@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 agam.shah@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020191105efb5005k1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Finance company Acima Credit LLC is using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  software from credit-ratings firm TransUnion to identify fraudulent applications, partly based on the device used.\par \par \uc2 The Salt Lake City-based lender extends financing to consumers with bad, little or no credit, allowing them to rent items such as furniture or appliances. Acima pays for the item, then leases it to the customer with an option to buy.\par \par \uc2 The company handles about 150,000 applications a month. Many of these are submitted at stores, while some relate to e-commerce purchases.\par \par \uc2 Before deploying the antifraud system, the company had few tools for catching fraudulent online applications early in the underwriting process, said Robert Christiansen, Acima's president and chief information officer.\par \par \uc2 The company typically offers financing ranging from $300 to $5,000 over 12-month terms, but a bad actor with multiple fabricated identities can cause significant damage. "So we're talking about relatively low [amounts] on our end, but with a high degree of velocity, we can experience pretty substantial losses quickly," Mr. Christiansen said.\par \par \uc2 Synthetic identity theft is one of the fastest-growing forms of fraud and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-id-theft-thousands-of-credit-applicants-who-dont-exist-1520350404"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 one of the hardest to combat }}}\uc2 . Fraudsters combine fake names with Social Security numbers that haven't been assigned yet\u8212\'20\'14or those tied to children who have no credit history\u8212\'20\'14to obtain credit cards or loans and build credit. Because the person borrowing the money isn't real, there are no consumer victims to alert lenders.\par \par \uc2 A TransUnion study last month found that U.S. synthetic-ID fraud totaled roughly $1.02 billion in the second quarter of 2019, up slightly from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 Julie Conroy\uc2 , a research director at consulting firm \uc2 Aite Group LLC\uc2 , said some lenders don't have a sense of how big the problem is, because it is tough to distinguish between legitimate loan losses and those associated with fake identities. "So they spend valuable collector time hunting down someone who doesn't exist," she said.\par \par \uc2 To combat the fraudsters, Acima in 2017 started using antifraud technology from iovation Inc. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transunion-to-acquire-anti-fraud-startup-iovation-1526680132"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 TransUnion acquired iovation }}}\uc2  last year for an undisclosed sum and embedded its technology into a platform now dubbed IDVision with iovation.\par \par \uc2 Businesses including financial firms use the platform to evaluate online transactions, such as credit or loan applications. The technology identifies the device behind the transaction without needing to know any personal information about the user, tapping \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms trained to analyze hundreds of attributes related to the hardware, software or network being used. It also uses algorithms to create risks scores for devices, based partly on whether that device has been previously used to commit fraud or whether its user has engaged in suspicious activity, such as accessing multiple accounts in a short period.\par \par \uc2 Iovation said it tracks approximately 6 billion devices globally, and its platform is connected to a consortium of more than 35,000 businesses that submit reports when they encounter bad actors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christiansen said some consumers who borrow from Acima don't have credit histories, so the company wanted a way to point out perpetrators, including those using fictitious identities.\par \par \uc2 "When we launched our e-commerce platform we knew that we had to go beyond the face-to-face applications that we had in place," he said, "and have something that offers more visibility into the device."\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, he said, the tool was able to help his team spot someone based in Arkansas who attempted to lease items, mostly laptop computers. He said that person had sent in about 100 applications using multiple fake identities and tried to make it seem as if the applications were coming from other states. The company hasn't taken steps to identify the fraudster, but it has denied that person's applications, he said.\par \par \uc2 "We know based on iovation that the applications he's sending in are originating from his [internet service provider] in this particular city," Mr. Christiansen said. "But we see [the device] within minutes jumping all the way across the country. So we'll see absolutely different applications appearing, but his device remains the same."\par \par \uc2 Overall, Mr. Christiansen said, the software is flagging about 10% of the roughly 70,000 applications that are screened monthly by iovation's technology. For those transactions that are flagged, Acima might ask additional verification questions, he added.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jared Council at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jared.council@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jared.council@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROAI20191104efb400001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The hybrid creations fill a space between traditional active management and broad index investing. Cost-conscious investors can choose between a huge variety of these strategies but a slowdown in fund launches last year hints that the market is becoming saturated.\par \par \uc2 Employing insights from active management, smart beta funds use rules-based methodologies alongside value, momentum, low volatility and quality. Investors increasingly seek out the latter criterion as concern grows over the economic outlook.\par \par \uc2 "Since the start of the year, there has been a strong preference for defensive and risk-mitigating factors," says Manuela Sperandeo, managing director at iShares, \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's exchange traded fund provider.\par \par \uc2 New systematic strategies typically include characteristics targeted at outperformance. IShares' Edge range of ETFs screens stocks using four factors in the index-creation process. 'Advancements in data allow a very granular picture of companies' and the ability to get deeper insights for index creation," says Ms Sperandeo. As with traditional indices, reweighting typically takes place at quarterly or semi-annual intervals, whichhelpskeepcostslow.\par \par \uc2 The slowdown in fund launches in 2018 was accompanied by a pause in "Thegrowth of US assets under management to slightly less than $900bn says \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 , the data provider.\par \par \uc2 New US and European fund launches slowed to 103, down from 184 in 2017. The trend looks to have continued in 2019, with only 54 funds launched to date. A shift into value and dividend funds this year has, however, helped to push smart beta assetsover the $1tnmark.\par \par \uc2 Active managers are also fighting to stem the flow of funds to lower-cost alternatives.\par \par \uc2 The approval by US regulators of the first "non-transparent" ETF is raising hopes that traditional active managers will be able to compete on a less uneven playing field. The design of the ActiveShares ETF by \uc2 Precidian Investments\uc2  allows for portfolio holdings to remain undisclosed for up to 90 days, the same as disclosure times for mutual funds combined with the lower costs of an ETF.\par \par \uc2 "One factor cited for holding back active equity managers from taking advantage of these structures is that they are worried about revealing their picks to the rest of the investment community," says Grant Engelbart, director of research at CLS Investment which oversees over $9bn of assets .\par \par \uc2 A major advantage ETFs have over mutual funds is lower tax liabilities. "ETFs have always been a more taxefficient way to package an investment strategy. Unlike traditional mutual funds structures, they can avoid capital gains taxes as the sale of instruments takes place outside the funditself," says Mr Engelbart.\par \par \uc2 The new ETF structure could present unique challenges for those who run markets. "Detailed knowledge of holdings will not be fully known to participants like market makers who would hold large amounts of such an ETF's shares. That makes risk management more difficult, and if non-transparent ETFs do become a 'go to' for active strategies, we could see wider spreads quoted to take account of this," adds Mr Engelbart.\par \par \uc2 The new ETF structure is expected to add pressure to smart beta fund flows but is likely to cannibalise flows into existing mutual funds too. Not everyone is convinced of the need.\par \par \uc2 "The hype around so-called nontransparent ETFs has been a little overblown. There is little sign that retail investors are calling for these products, although some portfolio managers are," says Kip Meadows, chief executive of US-based fund administrator Nottingham.\par \par \uc2 Other managers betting on a shift of active strategies into ETF wrappers include \uc2 Eaton Vance\uc2  and T Rowe Price. Both await approval from the US Securities and Exchanges Commission for their non-transparent ETF structures.\par \par \uc2 Traditional active managers are not the only ones hoping to capture a portion of the funds going into lowercost products. Advances in \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  could remove humans from stock selection altogether. Robert Tull, president of Procure Holdings, thinks data science can bring hedge fund-style returns to low- cost index products.\par \par \uc2 "Ensemble data techniques have been successfully used outside of finance over 40 years. Applying them to the mutual fund universe we can build a portfolio of high-conviction stock picks to generate outsized returns," says Mr Tull.\par \par \uc2 A fund using the techniques developed by Ensemble Asset Management and Turing Technologies is yet to come to market. An AI actively managed ETF portfolio was launched in 2017 by EquBot but returns have failed to keep up with the S&P500.\par \par \uc2 Doubts remain over whether AI funds will be a hit with investors. "An opaque machine that selects stocks on criteria derived from \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  makes traditional managers wary," says Mr Engelbart.\par \par \uc2 'Advancements in data allow a very granular picture of companies' Manuela Sperandeo, iShares\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020191104efb4000ay\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But it has been under pressure to improve its performance, cut costs and attract more business.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 In September,\u160\'00\'A0Mr Neal published what he calls a \u8220\'20\'1CBlueprint\u8221\'20\'1D detailing six ways he plans to turn Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s around. They include new platforms to arrange insurance for both\u160\'00\'A0complex and commoditised risks, and a more automated claims process. He hopes that, over time, these changes will help\u160\'00\'A0 double \u160\'00\'A0the amount of business done in the market from last year's \u163\'00\'A336bn.\par \par \uc2 Although much of the more complex business at Lloyd's will still be negotiated face to face, the new platforms should help to process the policies more efficiently, helping Mr Neal in his goal to sharply cut down the 40p cost of every \u163\'00\'A31 of premium sold at Lloyd's.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COverall, the (proposed) change is massive,\u8221\'20\'1D said Greg Brown, partner at consultancy Oxbow Partners. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd a lot of it is technology \u8212\'20\'14 only one of the six areas in the blueprint doesn\u8217\'20\'19t talk about building a platform for 2020. All of them are major large-scale platform builds or buys.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Neal says it\u8217\'20\'19s easier to implement such major changes now than it would have been three or four years ago. \u8220\'20\'1CThe advent of the cloud allows you to build in a step by step way with an open architecture,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, referencing technology that allows companies to access computing power on demand rather than relying on their own servers.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Mr Neal said\u160\'00\'A0that in a \u8220\'20\'1Cmodern world\u8221\'20\'1D there was no need to build everything from scratch, and companies can instead adapt what already exists.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 That is where the outside help comes in. As well as the giants of the tech world, Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s has been approached by exchanges such as \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  and \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 , and insurtech start-ups which all believe they can play a role in the marketplace's transformation.\par \par \uc2 Of the big tech companies, Mr Neal says: \u8220\'20\'1CThey are platform companies, and we are a platform business as well. How much of what they have fits in with an insurance platform remains to be seen.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Technology experts say work on building or adapting the core systems is likely to go to experienced companies rather than start-ups.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, Mr Neal says\u160\'00\'A0start-ups will have an important role to play in the future. He has been a strong supporter of\u160\'00\'A0Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s Lab, the incubator set up by his predecessor \uc2 Inga Beale\uc2 . Much of the work on the Blueprint was done by people based in the Lab on the fourth floor of the Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s building in the City of London.\par \par \uc2 He says that in future, companies in Lab should be \u8220\'20\'1Ccompletely aligned\u8221\'20\'1D with the changes that he has proposed in the Blueprint.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The brokers and underwriters at Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s are often perceived as\u160\'00\'A0resistant to change, so delivering all the reforms will be a big challenge.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COne of our questions is 'can the market deal with the change, do they have the resources for it?'\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Brown at Oxbow. \u8220\'20\'1CEveryone\u8217\'20\'19s worrying about it but nobody can do anything at the moment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Neal insists that there will be assistance available, especially for the multitude of smaller insurers and brokers which operate at Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ll help them both physically and financially,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is the only sensible way we can move at the speed we want to.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Quick Fire Q&A\par \par \uc2 Company name:\u160\'00\'A0Addepar\par \par \uc2 When founded:\u160\'00\'A02009\par \par \uc2 Where based: Headquarters in Mountain View, with offices in New York and Salt Lake City.\par \par \uc2 CEO:\u160\'00\'A0Eric Poirier, co-founded by \uc2 Joe Lonsdale\par \par \uc2 What do you sell, and who do you sell it to:\u160\'00\'A0Platform for data aggregation, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and portfolio reporting used by private wealth management institutions, registered investment advisers, and family offices.\par \par \uc2 How did you get started:\u160\'00\'A0Founded during the financial crisis to enable better investment decisions, today over $1.3tn in assets are managed on Addepar.\par \par \uc2 Amount of money raised so far:\u160\'00\'A0$240m\par \par \uc2 Valuation at latest fundraising:\u160\'00\'A0Not disclosed\par \par \uc2 Major shareholders:\u160\'00\'A0Founders & employees, 8VC, \uc2 Valor Equity Partners\par \par \uc2 There are lots of fintechs out there \u8212\'20\'14 what makes you so special:\u160\'00\'A0Our data model provides the ability to instantly see and report on complex ownership structures, multi-asset classes, and multicurrency scenarios.\par \par \uc2 Further fintech fascination\par \par \uc2 Follow the money:\u160\'00\'A0Apple Card isn't \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 ' only stake in the US credit card market.\u160\'00\'A0The Wall Street powerhouse has just\u160\'00\'A0led\u160\'00\'A0a $50m fundraising round in non traditional cards venture Deserve. Deserve uses technology to help partners like universities, associations and financial institutions to offer co-branded credit cards to younger clients.

Not content with delivering people and meals, the company now wants to deliver money and has set up a new unit, Uber Money, to do it.\u160\'00\'A0 According to the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 , the push is designed to help Uber\u8217\'20\'19s 4m drivers manage their money.\u160\'00\'A0Uber is familiar with irksome regulators thanks to its skirmishes with various agencies including \uc2 Transport for London\uc2 , but financial regulation, as \uc2 Facebook\uc2  recently discovered, is a whole other ball game\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\par \par \uc2 New frontiers (2):\u160\'00\'A0Financial information providers are on the hunt for new markets as investment banks \u8212\'20\'14 their traditional customers \u8212\'20\'14 cut back on the number of traders and analysts they employ,\u160\'00\'A0 reports the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 .

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Robin Wigglesworth applauds an account of one of the more enigmatic figures in financial markets\par \par \uc2 T he profound and the inane alike are debated on \uc2 Quora\uc2 , a website where the curious (or plain bored) can pose questions to the internet hive mind. \uc2 Renaissance Technologies\uc2 , a fabled yet secretive hedge fund, is one of the subjects that occasionally piques interest. Last year, a rival recounted how he had once nearly poached someone from Renaissance, only to be stymied at the last minute. "I read about him years later," the \uc2 Quora\uc2  contributor wrote. "He bought an Alp. As in ... an actual mountain in Austria."\par \par \uc2 The story has no doubt grown in the retelling. Nonetheless, it is a vivid example of the awestruck fascination that Renaissance commands in finance. Machines and algorithms have taken over swaths of markets, supplanting the grizzled traders of public perception, and no one has harnessed computer science and vast data sets to invest as successfully as Renaissance. "It's the gold standard of computer trading," one rival once ruefully admitted to me.\par \par \uc2 Despite its success, the hedge fund and its founder \uc2 Jim Simons\uc2  have largely remained an enigma. Even most people in finance would struggle to identify Simons out of a line-up of similarly disheveled octogenarians. Indeed, his chain-smoking, silver beard, wryness and reluctance to wear socks all make him seem more like a Coen Brothers character than a colossus of investing.\par \par \uc2 There has been the odd carefully chosen interview, but a quip to Seed Magazine in 2006 captured his views on fame.\par \par \uc2 Quoting Benjamin, Animal Farm's wise old donkey, Simons said: "'God gave me a tail to keep off the flies. But I'd rather have had no tail and no flies.' So, that's kind of the way I feel about publicity."\par \par \uc2 Yet in The Man Who Solved the Market, Gregory Zuckerman lifts the lid on the most fascinating man in financial markets: a liberal mathematician who once motorcycled from Boston to Bogot\u225\'00\'E1, was ejected from the Soviet code-cracking team at the Institute for Defense Analyses for opposing the Vietnam war, and then built the most relentless of moneymaking machines.\par \par \uc2 Zuckerman estimates Renaissance has generated over $100bn in trading profits since 1988 more than any other hedge fund in history making millionaires of many of its employees, and several billionaires. Forbes puts Simons' fortune at above $21bn, leaving other hedge fund magnates and financiers such as \uc2 Ray Dalio\uc2 , George Soros and Stephen Schwarzman trailing.\par \par \uc2 Quantitative finance as it is dubbed may seem a recondite subject to many people, but it is profoundly reshaping the investment industry, and thus capitalism itself. And Renaissance is the shining example of what can be achieved by applying modern technology, \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and lots of brainy people. More broadly, however, Renaissance is also emblematic of an era where technology helps money and power accrue to an increasingly small number of people. The choices that these people make can reverberate globally. While Simons has become one of the world's biggest backers of scientific research and philanthropy and a host of Democratic politicians his former colleague \uc2 Robert Mercer\uc2  has funnelled his billions into the far-right Breitbart News, the election of Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal journalist details many of the bumps, personal and professional, along the way. Renaissance's first years were spent in a poky office in a Long Island strip mall. Regu-lators once came calling after recommendations spat out by the early algorithms saw Renaissance nearly cornered the potato market.\par \par \uc2 Failure often loomed. When Renaissance's first foray into bond markets turned into big losses, Simons admitted to a colleague that "sometimes I look at this and feel I'm just some guy who doesn't really know what he's doing". Later, the increasing notoriety of Mercer caused consternation internally and externally. More tragically, two of Simons' sons died in accidents, leaving the hedge fund manager devastated.\par \par \uc2 Yet Renaissance has enjoyed a golden run the likes of which investing has never seen. When it notched up its first $1m one-day profit in 1990, Simons handed out champagne but $1m oneday gains quickly "became so frequent that the drinking got a bit out of hand", according to Zuckerman. Today, it wouldn't create a murmur at Renaissance's East Setauket headquarters, let alone the clink of champagne glasses.\par \par \uc2 For all Simons' undoubted brilliance, the book makes clear that his skill was not inventing complex trading models and algorithms himself. His talent was to spot, nurture and harness beautiful but often combustible minds such as James Ax, Lenny Baum, Elwyn Berlekamp, \uc2 Henry Laufer\uc2 , Peter Brown and Mercer. One person describes Renaissance's motley group of scientists and mathematicians as "a bunch of Sheldons", a reference to the socially inept but brainy star of The Big Bang Theory.\par \par \uc2 The book has some imperfections primarily that Zuckerman does not use his detailed reporting as a scaffolding to tell an even bigger story of how the business of investing has evolved over the past half-century.\par \par \uc2 While Simons was still toiling away as a codebreaker and frustrated academic, a bunch of brilliant financial economists were laying the groundwork for today's era of algorithmic markets. Simons may be the quant industry's paragon, but he is far from its only giant. Yet aside from a sprinkling of historical context, The Man Who Solved the Market is overwhelmingly focused on Simons, Renaissance and its eclectic eggheads. An occasional nod to the broader perspective would have enhanced a vivid tale of one of the biggest actors in one of the biggest stories of our time: how machines conquered financial markets. For years Simons has been the white whale of many financial reporters. In Zuckerman he has met his Ahab.\par \par \uc2 Robin Wigglesworth is the FT's global finance correspondent The Man Who Solved the Market: How \uc2 Jim Simons\uc2  Launched the Quant Revolution by Gregory Zuckerman Portfolio $30/\u163\'00\'A320, 384 pages\par \par \uc2 Renaissance shows what you can do by applying technology, \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and lots of brainy people\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020191102efb2000k7\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc49}{\*\bkmkend toc49}\b \uc2 U.S. News -- Analysis: \uc2 Health Plan\uc2  To Leave Mark On Economy\b0\par\par\uc2 By Richard Rubin \par \uc2 691 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 November 2019\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Sen. Elizabeth Warren's new Medicare for All plan would leave a sizable imprint on the U.S. economy, altering consumer spending and business investment while upending the health-care sector.\par \par \uc2 Nearly $20 trillion in new taxes over the next decade on corporations, investors and wealthy individuals would damp business profits. Households would see their costs reduced by $11 trillion, boosting their ability to spend on other goods and services. The plan also includes immigration-policy changes that would expand the labor force and consumer base.\par \par \uc2 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , who advised the Democratic presidential candidate's campaign on the plan, said he hadn't yet conducted a full analysis of Ms. Warren's proposals. "My sense is at the end of the day, from a macroeconomic perspective, it's probably going to be a wash, give or take," said Mr. Zandi, who wasn't paid and hasn't endorsed the Massachusetts senator. "By itself, the tax increases are a negative. But in the context of all the moving parts, it's not clear."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Warren detailed her Medicare for All plan on Friday. The health-care side had been mostly clear before. Private insurance and the associated premiums and out-of-pocket costs that consumers pay would vanish in the shift to asystem where health payments pass through the government.\par \par \uc2 The tax proposals to make that happen, however, had been unknown before Friday, their absence a source of controversy for the lawmaker, who has risen to the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates because of her "plan for everything" tagline.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Warren offered several tax proposals that would mark a major policy shift. Taken together, they would greatly enlarge the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Health-insurance premiums paid by employers would be converted into a new "employer Medicare contribution" to the government, starting at an amount just below what employers pay now and adjusting toward national averages over time. The smallest businesses would be exempt. Economists generally believe that workers bear the cost of such taxes, so the total economic burden of taxes on households would rise even if they have lower total costs for taxes and health care combined.\par \par \uc2 "This is a tax plan to build a better Denmark," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who has advised Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The plan relies on aggressive assumptions about savings on administrative costs in the health system that haven't yet been vetted by private-sector and government economists. And the net harm or benefit is likely to be the subject of interparty and partisan debate. But analysts said several features have generally clear economic implications.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Warren would raise the corporate tax rate to 35% from 21% and require U.S. companies to pay that amount on their world-wide profits, instead of much lower minimum taxes in place now. She would also lengthen depreciation schedules, reversing a core piece of the 2017 GOP tax law. That combination would reduce after-tax returns on investment and could make businesses less likely to invest in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 However, middling business investment since the 2017 tax cut complicates this argument. Democrats now have an easier time saying tax changes won't have major effects on business investment.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Warren now calls for a 6% annual wealth tax on billionaires, up from the 3% she had earlier proposed. She also would impose so-called mark-to-market taxation on capital gains, so that people would have to pay each year on their assets' increase in value even if they don't sell them.\par \par \uc2 Those changes could all damp investment by lowering after-tax returns. And they could make investors wary about the future path of corporate profits.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zandi, however, said the most important move Ms. Warren made was showing that her plan's revenue matches its costs.

Companies in Germany and France, the continent's economic powerhouses, and in other \uc2 European Union\uc2  countries are concerned about depending on technology providers that must comply with the U.S. Cloud Act, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-wants-homegrown-cloud-services-to-rival-amazon-microsoft-11571909400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro Cybersecurity reported in October }}}\uc2 . The 2018 law requires American firms to provide law enforcement with customers' personal data on request, even when the servers containing the information are abroad.\par \par \uc2 "There's no answer to the question of how secure our data really is," Frank Melzer, chief technology officer of \uc2 Festo AG\uc2 , a German company that makes robots and other industrial products, said this week at a German digital conference where Gaia-X was announced.\par \par \uc2 Cloud providers taking part in Gaia-X will be required to certify to their corporate customers that their information remains secure and provide guarantees about where it is stored and how it is processed. Participating in the project would require cloud providers to use the same standards, letting businesses easily move their data from one provider to another.\par \par \uc2 French and \uc2 German government\uc2  officials are set to meet this month with companies interested in participating and the plan is to create a governance structure for the initiative before the end of the year, the German Economy Ministry said. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate.\par \par \uc2 Some European companies that use large American cloud providers say those services are more competitively priced than cloud services in Europe, WSJ Pro previously reported. Gaia-X could lower transaction costs by standardizing contracts and processes between cloud providers and customers, the German Economy Ministry said. It didn't provide details about how much governments plan to invest in the project.\par \par \uc2 Gaia-X is an "important initiative" but details about performance, services and cost will determine whether European cloud providers can compete with non-European suppliers, a spokeswoman for German bank Commerzbank SA told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity in an email. \uc2 Commerzbank\uc2  uses cloud services from \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 ., she said.\par \par \uc2 Another goal of the infrastructure plan is to help European companies in industries such as manufacturing and health care in their efforts to develop algorithms and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  without relying on foreign technology providers, government officials said.\par \par \uc2 "We need something like an Airbus for \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said at this week's conference.\par \par \uc2 Roberto Viola, a \uc2 European Commission\uc2  official focused on communication and technology, also compared Gaia-X to \uc2 Airbus SE\uc2 , the European multinational plane maker that is the main competitor to U.S.-based \uc2 Boeing Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Europe remains open to the world, but with an ambition\u8230\'20\'26to have digital sovereignty," he said, speaking at the same conference.\par \par \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  and Amazon said they are able to host corporate data securely and criticized the German and French governments' approach.\par \par \uc2 A Microsoft spokesperson said digital sovereignty is a legitimate goal, adding, "in the cloud age, however, we think it is wrong to define sovereignty solely along territorial borders." Instead, sovereignty needs "the most powerful cloud solution."\par \par \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  is interested in participating in Gaia-X, the spokesperson said.\par \par \uc2 The German Economy Ministry said non-EU companies will be able to take part in the initiative if they "share our goals of data sovereignty and data availability." A ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on whether U.S.-based companies can meet those goals if they comply with the U.S. Cloud Act.\par \par \uc2 A spokesperson for Amazon's cloud provider \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2  said that Germany and France's plan "removes many of the fundamental benefits of cloud computing for customers\u8212\'20\'14it restricts freedom of choice, flexibility, and ability to scale globally, without increasing security."\par \par \uc2 Write to Catherine Stupp at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20191101efb100001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Business activity and confidence are declining at the macro level, but the venture and startup world has still been extremely active, according to a new report.\par \par \uc2 Venture funds of a billion dollars or more, so-called "megafunds," keep growing\u8212\'20\'14in size and number, per \uc2 Silicon Valley Bank\uc2 's fourth quarter report. There is $26.8 billion in dry powder waiting to be invested from megafunds raised in 2018 alone. That should help insulate some startups in a potential downturn, the report states. Now 33 venture firms have raised at least one megafund and 74 total megafunds have been raised.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, despite the warnings and fear of overvaluing startups from many investors, investors continue to put high prices on startups. There were more than 50 unicorns created in 2019. And there is still a backlog of unicorn companies that need to exit.\par \par \uc2 Even after Uber, Lyft and others going public this year, there is now a record total value of private unicorn companies still waiting to exit\u8212\'20\'14$385 billion worth, matching 2018's record level.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 New money. AI Capital, a new venture-capital firm targeting \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -based enterprise software startups, is raising a $100 million second fund which it expects to close next year, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports.\par \par \uc2 * The Boulder, Colo.-based firm has been investing out of a $10 million pilot fund launched in 2017.\par \par \uc2 * The firm has just led its first venture financing, a $7 million round made out of its pilot fund into startup Link3D Inc., which builds business software to streamline equipment manufacturers' production and supply-chain management.\par \par \uc2 Fixing SoftBank Vision Fund. Having put the SoftBank Vision Fund together, \uc2 Rajeev Misra\uc2  is now the man in charge of keeping it from falling apart. A finance whiz who cut his teeth on Wall Street, he pads around the Vision Fund's London headquarters barefoot, often chewing on betel nuts, a mild stimulant. He recently changed the layout of his office after consulting his astrologer. Inside the Vision Fund, investment decisions often are made in minutes, said people familiar with its operations. A consultant's report last year quoted employees describing a "chaotic" and "personality driven" firm with few controls, where people are "incentivized to gamble to look good" and build their own personal brands.\par \par \uc2 Immunotherapy funding. Tmunity Therapeutics Inc. has raised a $75 million Series B funding led by \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  to propel a series of cancer-fighting cellular therapies through clinical trials, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Philadelphia-based Tmunity and other companies are developing novel cell therapies that could potentially treat a range of solid-organ tumors in addition to blood cancers. Andreessen's funding stems from an investment thesis that it is becoming increasingly possible to engineer medicines for very specific purposes, general partner Jorge Conde said. Other cell-therapy startups raising recently include Arsenal Biosciences Inc., which in October disclosed an $85 million Series A raised from Westlake Village BioPartners and others. Westlake Village also invested in this round for Tmunity. In addition to \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  and Westlake Village, investors in the Tmunity financing include Be the Match BioTherapies, BrightEdge, \uc2 Gilead Sciences\uc2  and the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2 . Tmunity has raised a total of $231 million.\par \par \uc2 Write down. \uc2 Altria Group Inc\uc2 . wrote down its investment in \uc2 Juul Labs Inc\uc2 . by more than a third and now holds it at a price that values the e-cigarette maker at about $24 billion. The tobacco giant cited unexpected shifts in Juul's market, including proposed U.S. bans on e-cigarette flavors and regulatory crackdowns abroad, for its decision to book a write-down of $4.5 billion. \uc2 Altria\uc2  also disclosed Thursday that the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  is investigating the company's role in the resignation of Juul's former chief executive officer and his replacement by an \uc2 Altria\uc2  executive, along with other hires from the tobacco company.\par \par \uc2 VC Funds\par \par \uc2 Courtside Ventures, which makes early-stage investments in sports-related media and technology companies, seeks to raise $100 million for its second fund, according to a regulatory filing. The New York- and Los Angeles-based firm includes cycling computer maker Hammerhead, personal coaching app Freeletics and sports news provider The Athletic in its portfolio.\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 China is about to switch on 5G. It's behind the U.S., but not for long. Three state-owned wireless carriers are set to open China's 5G network for public use on Friday in about 50 cities.\par \par \uc2 Apple plays the underdog in streaming wars.

Some think a complex group of sugars is the crucial ingredient.\par \par \uc2 Nintendo Switch Lite's strong debut raises hopes for the holiday season. Japanese company sold 1.95 million of the new hand-held device in 10 days.\par \par \uc2 The super rich are buying $100 million homes. For some, one isn't enough. Since 2007, 20 homes have sold for once unthinkable nine-figure price tags, though many more have tried and failed.\par \par \uc2 Around the Web\par \par \uc2 50 years ago, the internet was born in Room 3420.

I actually made my pitch to him while he was on the treadmill for his workout session."\par \par \uc2 Point72 is leading a $34m funding round, which takes the amount Mirror has raised so far to $72m.\par \par \uc2 The company declined to comment on the valuation the new money puts on Mrs Putnam's company, but Delaware filings from April suggested Mirror aimed to sell shares valuing it at almost $300m.\par \par \uc2 The company did not say how much of the $34m came from Mr Cohen. In a statement on Wednesday, it said it would use the proceeds to "expand into new areas and content verticals".\par \par \uc2 Point72 Ventures, which invests money from Mr Cohen and employees of \uc2 Point72 Asset Management\uc2 , his $14.6bn hedge fund, has typically focused on fintech and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  start-ups. Its investments include Acorns, a personal finance app, and \uc2 Quantopian\uc2 , a crowdsourced algorithmic trading fund.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cohen opened \uc2 Point72 Asset Management\uc2  to outside capital last year after serving a two-year ban from managing money for investors, part of a settlement with the \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  over insider trading charges at his previous hedge fund.\par \par \uc2 He was never personally charged with improper trading.\par \par \uc2 Mirror is one of several start-ups aimed at the fitness industry. The company sells a $1,495 product, which appears to be a mirror when it is not streaming video fitness classes, with a celebrity following that includes Gwyneth Paltrow, the actor, and other clients of Tracy Anderson, the fitness trainer.\par \par \uc2 Peloton, one of the sector's leaders, raised $1.2bn during an initial public offering last month before dropping more than 11 per cent on its debut. The company's shares are trading about 20 per cent below the IPO price.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020191101efb1000j6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 China's blockchain frenzy, which sparked rallies in an array of companies, has catapulted one academic into the limelight.\par \par \uc2 Meet Chen Chun, a 63-year-old computer-science professor and an expert at a government-backed think tank. At a meeting last week, it was his job to brief Chinese President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  and other senior officials at the Communist Party's Politburo on the merits of blockchain\u8212\'20\'14the open-ledger technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Chen's briefing, Mr. Xi announced that China should {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-and-chinese-tech-stocks-surge-after-xi-jinping-touts-blockchain-11572259762"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 speed up research into blockchain}}}\uc2 , according to a report released late last week by the country's official \uc2 Xinhua News Agency\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While Beijing has previously been skeptical about cryptocurrencies, some investors and experts had expected cautious support for blockchain technology as part of a broader competition with the U.S. over financial firepower. \uc2 China's central bank\uc2  is also in the midst of developing its own digital currency. Yet the fact that such an endorsement for blockchain came from Mr. Xi himself took the market by surprise.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, stocks that had even a tangential connection to blockchain soared. The share prices of more than 150 blockchain-related listed companies were forced to suspend trading because they hit the upper 10% daily limit allowed in China's stock market, according to data provider Wind.\par \par \uc2 The price of bitcoin also jumped by about a third and briefly topped $10,000 after Mr. Xi's comments were publicized, before falling back in recent days. The world's most popular cryptocurrency recently traded around $9,100, according to research site CoinDesk.\par \par \uc2 For many of those companies, their rallies lost steam throughout the week. An index that tracks blockchain-linked stocks in mainland China rose just 3.1% for the week, after initially rising nearly 9% on Monday alone.\par \par \uc2 "This is classic speculation among retail investors," said Tony Gu, founding partner at NGC Ventures, a blockchain investment fund. "When you see rallies like this, the trend almost always dies off because there's no substance to it." He said the vast majority of companies claiming to have blockchain exposure don't actually make any money off the technology.\par \par \uc2 Among companies that maintained their share gains were some with ties to Mr. Chen or companies he has had stakes in.\par \par \uc2 One of them is \uc2 Insigma Technology Co\uc2 ., whose shares rose 26% over the past week. Mr. Chen co-founded the company in Hangzhou in eastern China decades ago; he left it in 2014. Insigma announced on Wednesday it holds a 2.8% stake in a private company Mr. Chen established two years later, Hangzhou Qulian Technology Co.; it didn't disclose whether Mr. Chen still holds stakes in Insigma.\par \par \uc2 Another winner in this week's rally is property developer Xinhu Zhongbao Co., which said in a Thursday filing with the \uc2 Shanghai Stock Exchange\uc2  that it owns nearly half of Qulian. It surged by the daily 10% limit all five days. Its market cap is currently $5.7 billion, according to FactSet, up from $3.4 billion a week ago.\par \par \uc2 There is no indication Mr. Chen directly profited from the market's sharp rally. He couldn't be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chen's connection with these companies is well-known in the industry, four blockchain and cryptocurrency investors told The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chen was listed in 2017 by \uc2 China's Ministry of Science and Technology\uc2  as a member of an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -strategy advisory committee, which was designated to support the country's megaplan for high-end manufacturing development, dubbed "Made in China 2025."\par \par \uc2 Investments are intricate in this knowledge-intensive industry, and often involve scholars and experts. According to public filings, Mr. Chen is a shareholder of at least four private companies and chairs the board of another two besides Qulian.\par \par \uc2 Qulian partnered with several state-owned enterprises including the \uc2 Shanghai Stock Exchange\uc2  and the power giant State Grid to develop blockchain platforms. It also runs research projects with \uc2 Zhejiang University\uc2 , where Mr. Chen directs a blockchain research center.\par \par \uc2 Chinese state media have warned about the risks of speculation in the blockchain business. Investors, meanwhile, worry that speculators might use the blockchain push to step up practices such as shadow lending or cross-border transfers that could eventually trigger a regulatory crackdown and hurt the industry as a whole.\par \par \uc2 The multiple stock-exchange filings this week by Insigma and Xinhu Zhongbao, in which they clarified their associations with Mr. Chen's company, were an indication of their desire to stay ahead of speculation around their dramatic market-cap gains.\par \par \uc2 Raffaele Huang contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Steven Russolillo at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:steven.russolillo@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 steven.russolillo@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020191101efb1002mh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Swollen inventories in India, where roughly 95% of the world's diamonds are processed and polished, have further depressed prices.\par \par \uc2 A price index based on a global aggregate of rough diamonds has declined 3.2% year-to-date and is down more than 12% over the past five years, according to Paul Zimnisky, the founder of research firm Diamond \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A multibillion-dollar bank fraud in India linked to a prominent diamantaire has also unsettled the industry, shrinking credit available to Indian diamond processors. The street protests rocking Hong Kong, home to Asia's largest diamond fair, have cooled one of the world's fastest-growing jewelry markets. Going forward, the rise of lab-grown diamonds and lower marriage rates among young adults worldwide pose additional threats, according to industry analysts.\par \par \uc2 The weakening market has taken a toll on smaller, independent mine operators. Montreal-based Stornoway Diamond, owner of the Renard Mine in Quebec, was forced to seek protection from creditors in September under Canada's equivalent of chapter 11 bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 In court papers, Stornoway's bankruptcy administrators said a "market price correction" last year crimped the company's cash flows and cited a weakening Indian rupee, a credit crunch among Indian diamantaires and an excess of polished inventory in the country.\par \par \uc2 Investors have also fled Jersey-based \uc2 Petra Diamonds Ltd\uc2 ., valuing its $650 million bond due in 2022 at 71 cents on the dollar Thursday morning, down from 94 cents in August, according to MarketAxess. A $550 million bond issued by Calgary-based Dominion Diamond Mines changed hands at 50 cents this week, down from 66.5 cents in August, according to MarketAxess.\par \par \uc2 Bonds issued by Toronto-based \uc2 Mountain Province Diamonds\uc2  are also trading below their par values. Earlier this month, the company said it sold rough diamonds in the third quarter at an average price of $52.5 per carat, down 27.6% from $72.5 per carat a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 The diamond industry is dominated by \uc2 Anglo American PLC\uc2 's \uc2 De Beers Group\uc2 , which represents 35% of global extraction, and \uc2 Alrosa Group\uc2 , which is part-owned by the Russian government and accounts for an estimated 29%, according to Diamond \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2 , \uc2 Dominion Diamond\uc2 , Petra and Mountain Province have less than 6% of global market share each. Other miners include the governments of Angola and Zimbabwe. Many of the smaller suppliers mine only diamonds and are highly vulnerable to pricing swings.\par \par \uc2 "At the current market prices some of these companies' assets are probably only marginally profitable," Mr. Zimnisky said. "When you model any asset that's in that situation, it's highly susceptible to price volatility."\par \par \uc2 Diamond mining requires high levels of capital expenditures, said Matthew Farwell, a managing director at Imperial Capital LLC who trades in commodity-backed debt securities. "To the extent that these companies need capital to operate, the pricing pressure has a large impact on cash flow."\par \par \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2  analysts earlier this month predicted diamond pricing would get worse before it gets better and said that lab-grown diamonds pose a real threat to the natural stone industry.\par \par \uc2 Last year's revelation of an alleged $2 billion bank fraud involving Nirav Modi, India's onetime jeweler to the stars, has made banks less willing to extend credit to Indian diamond processors, further pressuring demand for rough stones, Mr. Zimnisky said. After months as a fugitive, Mr. Modi was arrested in London in March and faces potential extradition to India on allegations he orchestrated a web of illegal loans guaranteed by India's state-owned \uc2 Punjab National Bank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A court-appointed examiner has linked the alleged fraud to Mr. Modi's U.S. businesses, which filed for bankruptcy after PNB uncovered it.\par \par \uc2 Write to Alexander Gladstone at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:alexander.gladstone@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 alexander.gladstone@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Bankruptcy also covers distressed companies. Inclusion of a company in this category is not intended to suggest that it will file for bankruptcy protection, default on its debt or suffer any other financial failure.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROBK20191031efav000b5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Venture capitalists are continuing to pay up for access to startups at most stages of their development, despite broader economic and political uncertainty.\par \par \uc2 Pre-money valuations in the third quarter rose for Series A, B and D and later rounds, while falling at the Series C and seed stages, according to a new report by law firm \uc2 Cooley LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While fears of trade wars and questions about initial public offerings persist, venture firms have large cash reserves and are putting their capital to work. Median Series A valuations rose to $30 million in the third quarter from $25 million in the prior quarter. Meanwhile, median seed valuations ticked down to $8 million from $9.5 million in the second quarter.\par \par \uc2 "Up" rounds made up 87% of the firm's 264 reported deals in the third quarter, little changed from the second quarter, Cooley said. Meanwhile, startups continue to have leverage with deal terms. Less than 7% of deals had full participating liquidation preferences, according to the report.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Stopping addiction. Startups are designing new tools and services that are intended to make access to addiction care easier, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. With millions of people battling substance abuse and not receiving treatment, venture-backed companies aim to lower those barriers by opening treatment centers and providing online services.\par \par \uc2 * They include CleanSlate Centers Inc., which operates outpatient treatment centers in 11 states, and startups that provide digital-treatment programs such as DynamiCare Health Inc.\par \par \uc2 * "There's no one magic answer," said \uc2 Garheng Kong\uc2 , managing partner of HealthQuest Capital, which has invested in the sector. "The demand is not anywhere near being fully met."\par \par \uc2 * Companies providing addiction care face regulatory hurdles in extending the reach of their services. And startups pursuing new, digital treatments have the challenge of building a body of research that persuades insurers, employers and consumers to use their products.\par \par \uc2 New firm alert. The public market stumbles of unprofitable, highly valued startups have prompted some investors to take a more hands-on approach toward early-stage businesses. Greatscale Ventures hopes to dispel the growth-at-all-costs ethos with its debut venture capital fund, which targets $60 million, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports exclusively. The newly launched firm intends to walk entrepreneurs through the entire process of company creation, hiring and go-to-market strategy. The firm's investment structure involves investing less capital than a typical venture firm, while essentially taking on a co-founder role in the companies. As a result, in a typical exit, Greatscale expects to have 40% equity in a company.\par \par \uc2 Fair CEO out. The founder and chief executive of troubled car-leasing startup Fair resigned Wednesday, following widespread layoffs as the company seeks a path to profitability and considers changes to its business model, the Journal's Heather Somerville reports. Scott Painter said in a memo to employees that he would step down as CEO and remain chairman of the board of directors. Adam Hieber of SoftBank, one of Fair's largest and most involved investors, will take over as interim CEO. Mr. Painter's resignation follows layoffs at Fair that eliminated about 40% of the Santa Monica, Calif-based company's workforce. In early 2018, Fair bought \uc2 Uber Technologies\uc2 's car-leasing program, known as Xchange Leasing. As part of that deal, Fair signed an exclusive agreement to lease cars to Uber drivers. SoftBank invested in Fair at the end of last year, leading the largest-ever equity financing round for the leasing company and pushing the startup's valuation to about $1.2 billion from about $450 million.\par \par \uc2 LA suspends Uber scooters. Los Angeles has temporarily suspended \uc2 Uber Technologies\uc2 's permit to offer dockless scooters for rent, amid a deepening disagreement over the city's data-collection efforts. The ride-hailing company, which offers scooters through its Jump business, was asked to show that it could comply with the requirements of the Mobility Data Specification, a platform city officials developed to track the number and movements of scooters around the city. Uber said that it wouldn't comply with the requirements, calling them invasive to customer privacy.\par \par \uc2 Exits\par \par \uc2 Customer experience technology company UserTesting acquired Truthlab, a provider of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 -based video analysis, for an undisclosed amount. San Francisco-based UserTesting is backed by Accel Partners and OpenView Venture Partners.\par \par \uc2 Workforce Logiq, a provider of workforce-management software and services to large companies, acquired predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  software provider Engage Talent for an undisclosed sum. Orlando, Fla.-based Workforce is backed by private-equity investor \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2 . Engage counted Revolution's Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Refinery Ventures and Grand Ventures among its investors.\par \par \uc2 ShareGrid Inc., a peer-to-peer marketplace for filmmakers and photographers, is expanding to the U.K. with the acquisition of London-based film and camera rental community BorrowFox. Terms weren't disclosed. Based in Seattle, ShareGrid is backed by MHS Capital and Archer Gray.\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to ban political ads.

It first grew the company before splitting it to sell it off in pieces.\par \par \uc2 Two out of three exits the lower-midmarket firm produced during the third quarter involved sales of companies that trace their roots to an original investment in Axiom in 2013. At that time, Carrick committed $36 million to the New York-based company, said \uc2 Jim Madden\uc2 , a Carrick co-founder and managing director.\par \par \uc2 Carrick first expanded Axiom by developing two additional businesses separate from its core lawyer-on-demand services and then spinning them off. One of the two, Axiom Managed Solutions, focuses on high volume, repetitive legal processes that companies can outsource, such as the elaboration of nondisclosure agreements. The other, Knowable Inc., uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other tools to extract data from contracts.\par \par \uc2 "We concluded last summer that the way to maximize value\u8230\'20\'26was probably separate [Axiom] into three pieces so investors can understand them differently," Mr. Madden said. "But there was a lot of planning and discussion before that."\par \par \uc2 The strategy is paying off for Carrick, which sold down 90% of its stake in Knowable when the company formed a joint venture, announced in July, with legal and regulatory information provider LexisNexis. Mr. Madden estimates the stake sale generated a roughly 35% net internal rate of return and a sixfold multiple of Carrick's investment.\par \par \uc2 More recently, the firm {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/axiom-global-to-get-investment-from-permira-drops-ipo-plans-11567708003?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=9"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  sold Axiom's core business  }}}\uc2 to fellow private-equity firm \uc2 Permira\uc2 , after dropping plans to take the company public. That sale, announced in September, produced a roughly 22% net IRR, Mr. Madden said. Carrick still owns Axiom Managed Solutions.\par \par \uc2 During the third quarter, Carrick exited at least one other portfolio company that didn't originate from the Axiom deal. In July, it sold InstaMed Holdings Inc., an operator of health-care payment networks the firm backed in 2016, to bank giant \uc2 JPMorgan Chase & Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Carrick scored a roughly 35% internal rate of return and a 2.7 multiple of invested capital with the sale of the Philadelphia-based company to \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , according to Mr. Madden.\par \par \uc2 "We're not done. We're working on more sales and more exits right now," he said.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2012, Carrick invests in companies that use technology to make business processes more efficient. The firm focuses on three areas: software as a service, business process outsourcing and transaction processing. The firm in 2017 was seeking $400 million for its latest fund, Carrick Capital Partners III LP, according to filings with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Write to Luis Garcia at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:luis.garcia@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 luis.garcia@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20191031efav0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp.'s \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  team has increased its ability to deploy \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  projects by collaborating more closely with other parts of the company.\par \par \uc2 The 50,000-employee bank has an AI center of excellence, which it opened in 2015, but the hub began operating with little involvement from other divisions. Business units essentially asked the center to solve specific problems and left it up to the AI team to develop a system.\par \par \uc2 The hub, dubbed the Center for \b \highlight22\uc2 Machine Learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , was essentially an outsourced AI service, said David Castillo, Capital One's managing vice president of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Virtually all the development work fell to the center, limiting the number of projects it could take on, said Mr. Castillo, who has been in his role since June 2018.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Mr. Castillo decided to change the model and have the business units take a bigger role in AI development. The switch multiplied by 10 the number of projects the hub can participate in, he said, declining to give specifics.\par \par \uc2 "We only had the capacity to absorb so many projects," he said about the old model. "And the way that we work now is collaboratively with all the teams, so our reach is much larger."\par \par \uc2 Few companies are realizing a return on their AI investments. While about nine of 10 corporate executives have made an investment in AI technology, fewer than two in five report any business gain from their AI efforts in the past three years, according to a recent study from MIT Sloan Management Review and \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2 . The report is based on a survey of more than 2,500 executives world-wide.\par \par \uc2 The use of centers of excellence that collaborate with business units under a "hub-and-spoke" model is an effective strategy for bringing AI projects to life, said Ritu Jyoti, IDC's program vice president of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  strategies, speaking at the AI World conference in Boston last week.\par \par \uc2 At Capital One, the center started off as a sort of think tank and prototyping hub, used by the bank's four main business units\u8212\'20\'14retail banking, commercial banking, credit card and auto finance.\par \par \uc2 For AI projects under the old model, the interaction with the business units mostly consisted of weekly update meetings and demos.\par \par \uc2 Today, the process is far more collaborative, with \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  experts and data engineers from Mr. Castillo's team working side-by-side with business-unit data scientists, subject matter experts and software engineers. The team members hold daily meetings lasting 10 to 20 minutes to deal with day-to-day issues. Product managers from both sides participate in weekly meetings for bigger-picture issues.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the typical development process for a system takes no longer than 12 weeks. The goal is to get to a "minimum viable product," or an AI application with the core features, which team members can start testing, Mr. Castillo said. At that point, the center begins to disengage from the project.\par \par \uc2 One of the first projects deployed under the new approach was a fraud-detection AI application for the credit-card unit, released earlier this year. Its \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms predict the likelihood that cardholders took out the credit card to scam the bank, and that they intend to run up bills and simply not pay them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Castillo declined to say what factors feed into that prediction beyond saying that the algorithms are trained on credit-card-fraud data. The application is designed to identify accounts where user fraud is likely, enabling bank employees to intervene by, for instance, scrutinizing transactions or lowering credit limits.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jared Council at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jared.council@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jared.council@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROAI20191030efau00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting 100,000 new jobs.\par \par \uc2 The service-producing sector drove the increase, accounting for 138,000 new jobs, while the good-producing sector lost 13,000 jobs.\par \par \uc2 "While job growth continues to soften, there are certain segments of the labor market that remain strong," Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in prepared remarks. "The goods producing sector showed weakness; however, the healthcare industry and midsized companies had solid gains," he said.\par \par \uc2 Large businesses, or those that have at least 500 employees, added 44,000 jobs. Midsize businesses created 64,000 new jobs and small businesses, or those with 49 employees or fewer, added 17,000 jobs.\par \par \uc2 Of the 138,000 jobs the service-producing sector added, the growth was across all industries. The education and health services industry added 41,000 jobs, while trade, transportation and utilities added 32,000 jobs.\par \par \uc2 Within the goods-producing sector, the construction industry lost 4,000 jobs and the natural resources and mining jobs also fell by 4,000.

Despite widespread talk of wanting to devote more capital to emerging startup hubs, venture capitalists are still overwhelmingly spending their money right where they always have: California, New York and Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 While we continue to see firms like Revolution\u8212\'20\'14which just closed $150 million for its second Rise of the Rest Seed Fund to back startups located outside of Silicon Valley\u8212\'20\'14and group efforts by local governments and the business communities of cities like Houston, Buffalo or Milwaukee to spark entrepreneurial activity, the data doesn't lie.\par \par \uc2 In fact, even though venture capitalists are investing more money than ever into startups, they are devoting an increasingly smaller percentage to the other 47 states, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. A decade ago, venture capitalists committed just over half of the roughly $34 billion total invested to those top three states. By 2018, when total venture funding into U.S. startups hit a record $135 billion, 78% of it was going to California, New York and Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 With a quarter left to go in 2019, that top-funded trio is on pace to eclipse everyone else even further.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Faire business: San Francisco startup Faire has made a billion-dollar business providing mom-and-pop stores with an Amazon-like marketplace for wholesale items at a time when many of the biggest retailers have been struggling, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports exclusively.\par \par \uc2 * Faire, officially known as Indigo Fair Inc., has raised $150 million at a $1 billion post-money valuation. Lightspeed Venture Partners and Founders Fund co-led the round. Existing investors \uc2 Forerunner Ventures\uc2 , \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  and \uc2 Khosla Ventures\uc2  also participated.\par \par \uc2 * The investment represents a bet that local shops will thrive and will be aided by e-commerce rather than thwarted by it.\par \par \uc2 * Faire said it processes more than $1 million in transactions a day at times.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc63}{\*\bkmkend toc63}\b \uc2 China Presses Ahead On Silicon Valley Deals\b0\par\par\uc2 By Heather Somerville \par \uc2 926 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2019\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Chinese investors are pressing ahead with investments into startups and venture-capital funds, emboldened in part by ambiguities in U.S. efforts to limit foreign access to technology deals.\par \par \uc2 Key rules for implementing a 2018 U.S. law intended to curb foreign access to sensitive technologies are yet to be defined, often leaving investors and entrepreneurs to determine which deals are permissible. For their part, U.S. tech entrepreneurs want to nurture connections to China.\par \par \uc2 Investment ties between the two countries thus remain tight despite political and trade tensions, say technology investors, entrepreneurs, attorneys, and current and former government officials.\par \par \uc2 The sources of Chinese-affiliated money vary widely, as do investors' motivations. Both can be hard to discern.\par \par \uc2 Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hone Capital was set up in 2015 with about $200 million from China Science and Merchants Investment Management Group, a Chinese private-equity firm known as CSC Group that nearly two years ago was delisted from a Chinese stock exchange, according to a person familiar with the matter and public documents.\par \par \uc2 Since the law was passed, Hone has continued to invest in the U.S., including in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  startups. Last year, Canadian private-equity firm Whitehorse Liquidity Partners gave Hone about $50 million to invest, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Hone hasn't received funding from China in more than two years, said founder Veronica Wu. Yet Hone employees still report to CSC Group, which recently emphasized that the long-term strategy is to bring U.S. technology companies to China, the person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Last month, more than 10,000 people flocked to a technology conference in Santa Clara, Calif., an annual gathering of mostly Chinese and U.S. tech workers and investors known as the Silicon Valley Innovation & Entrepreneurship Forum. Speakers included scientists affiliated with the \uc2 National Aeronautics and Space Administration\uc2  and U.S. national labs.\par \par \uc2 "Some people in Washington want to decouple the two economies. We disagree," Ren Faqiang, China's deputy consul general in San Francisco, told the audience.\par \par \uc2 The 2018 law expanded the power of the \uc2 Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S\uc2 ., or \uc2 Cfius\uc2 , to probe minority investments in critical tech companies through which foreign investors could influence a company's business decisions.\par \par \uc2 The law mandates that certain startups fundraising from foreign investors report their deals to \uc2 Cfius\uc2  for approval, and that \uc2 Cfius\uc2  do a better job sniffing out unreported foreign investments in sensitive technologies.\par \par \uc2 Cfius\uc2  has broad authority to unwind deals after they have closed if it determines the technology should be restricted, so not reporting a foreign investment can be risky, said William Newsom, an attorney with law firm \uc2 Cooley LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The law prompted an initial pullback. The amount of Chinese venture investment in the U.S. during the first half of 2019 declined about 27% in dollar terms from the second half of 2018, according to research firm Rhodium Group.\par \par \uc2 "We were seeing a very conservative approach from investors initially," said Larry Ward, a Cfius attorney with law firm \uc2 Dorsey & Whitney LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Cfius\uc2  appears ill-equipped to police the venture-capital industry, current and former government officials said.\par \par \uc2 The government also hasn't codified which technologies are off-limits to foreigners, so some startups and investors don't see the need to file with \uc2 Cfius\uc2 , Mr. Ward and other lawyers said.\par \par \uc2 Palo Alto, Calif.-based Amino Capital said it received funding from a local government in eastern China a couple of years ago. The firm, which also manages a venture fund in China, hasn't changed its U.S. investment strategy in response to the \uc2 Cfius\uc2  law, said co-founder Jun Wu, who left the firm in August. He said the government phased out its support for Amino, but the firm is still mostly backed by Chinese investors. About 80% of the funding now comes from executives and owners of Chinese businesses seeking to move their money outside China, Mr. Wu said.\par \par \uc2 Amino managing partner Larry Li said the firm's partners are U.S. citizens and none of its backers have access to private information about startups, nor can they make investment decisions on behalf of the firm.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Amino incubated and funded DataBeyond, a Palo Alto company that provides data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  on fashion trends. One of Amino's partners briefly served as its chief executive. The startup's new CEO, Xiaoxi Zhang, and its top technology officer, Adrian Wang, said the relationship provided Amino with more access and influence over the company's business strategy and growth plans than an average investor. They said their lawyer told them they didn't have to alert \uc2 Cfius\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some Chinese investors are choosing different tactics, including taking pains to conceal their identity, U.S. defense officials and venture capitalists said. Other Chinese investors have been content to make only passive investments.\par \par \uc2 "Investment that is purely passive is inherently low-risk from a national security standpoint and in most cases should be welcomed," said David Hanke, a partner at law firm Arent Fox who was the lead staff architect of the \uc2 Cfius\uc2  legislation while working for its sponsor, \uc2 Sen. John Cornyn\uc2  (R., Texas). "We didn't want to shut off the flow of truly benign investment."\par \par \uc2 "The policies we have put in place have not been all that effective in limiting China's technology ambitions," said Nicholas Eftimiades, a retired senior U.S. intelligence officer whose work has focused on China.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20191029000076"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020191029efat0000l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Technology investor Insight Partners announced leading an $11 million Series A round for Fairmarkit, a Boston startup selling software to procurement departments. It's one of at least seven Series A rounds led by Insight this year.\par \par \uc2 After raising a $6.3 billion growth fund last year, why is the New York-based firm taking a lead on Series A rounds?\par \par \uc2 "The reality is enterprise-software companies, which Insight focuses on, are raising larger funds later and require a lot of capital as they scale," an Insight spokeswoman said. Venture deals represent about 15% of the firm's portfolio.\par \par \uc2 Insight isn't alone. Numerous firms that manage large multi-stage funds are continuing or even increasing their activity in early stages, including Series A and seed rounds. This offers investors a chance to get into companies early and avoid being priced out of later stage rounds.\par \par \uc2 Separately, Insight Partners, which has backed companies such as \uc2 Twitter Inc\uc2 . and e-commerce platform \uc2 Shopify Inc\uc2 ., has set up its first overseas office in Tel Aviv.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Focus on Governance: After suffering billions of dollars of losses on its investment in WeWork, \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 .'s Vision Fund is scaling back its high-risk investing strategy and focusing more on improving corporate governance of portfolio companies.\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , SoftBank's chairman and CEO who also runs the Vision Fund, has told staffers at the fund to push the companies in which it owns stakes to generate cash, people familiar with the matter said. A drastic shift from his earlier demands that they spend aggressively to drive sales growth.\par \par \uc2 * Roughly a dozen of the fund's investment staff have left on their own since spring, many unhappy about what they see as a toxic culture with competing teams, inexperienced investment executives, and poor communication, people familiar with the structure said.\par \par \uc2 Public debut: Fertility-benefits company \uc2 Progyny Inc\uc2 . began trading on the Nasdaq, marking a first for the industry. The startup, which already is profitable, is looking to raise its profile by going public, said Chief Executive David Schlanger. The company began trading under the ticker symbol PGNY on Friday at an opening share price of $13. It closed at $15.94, up 23%.\par \par \uc2 Pioneer investor: Don Valentine, a pioneer among venture capitalists who struck it rich with investments in companies including \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Cisco Systems Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Oracle Corp\uc2 . and Atari, died on Friday. He founded Sequoia Capital, and stepped away from its leadership in 1996. Yet the firm still operates in his image: that of a tough-guy investor who instills fear in boardrooms and walks with a swagger.\par \par \uc2 China's has more unicorns: The number of private startups valued at more than $1 billion in China has just edged ahead of the U.S., according to a report published by Deloitte and research firm China Venture. But that doesn't mean it is easy going for horned horses in the Middle Kingdom\u8212\'20\'14funding has been drying up, and exit opportunities are disappearing. Even big corporate investors like Tencent and Alibaba, which have invested in a lot of late-stage startups, have turned more cautious. That means startups have to start figuring out sustainable business models sooner.\par \par \uc2 Exits\par \par \uc2 Social-media management platform \uc2 Sprout Social Inc\uc2 . publicly disclosed its filing for going public. The S-1 filing revealed that \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  owns a 35.5% stake, \uc2 New Enterprise Associates\uc2  owns 30.9% and Lightbank holds 21%. WSJ Pro Venture Capital reported last month that the Chicago-based company had submitted a confidential filing for its IPO.\par \par \uc2 Cabaletta Bio Inc\uc2 ., which is developing a treatment for pemphigus vulgaris, priced its initial public offering of 6.8 million shares of common stock at $11 a share, below the initial price range of $14 to $16 a share. Prior to the offering, \uc2 5AM Ventures\uc2 , \uc2 Adage Capital Partners\uc2  and Baker Bros. Advisors each held a 19% stake in Cabaletta, and Boxer Capital and Deerfield Management held 5.5% stakes. The company will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol CABA.\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 Time for a tech reboot.

It has the backing of industry heavyweights like investment banks \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2 , as well as \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest asset manager and one of the biggest ETF providers.\par \par \uc2 The hub offers a platform to help create and redeem baskets of bonds in ETFs, as well as assemble baskets of fixed income ETFs, a fast-growing sector that has spurred some modernisation of the underlying market. It has already gone live with equity-focused ETFs.\par \par \uc2 Over the past 25 years, the ETF market has mushroomed to 2,000 US funds with $3.9tn in total net assets at the end of August, according to ICI, an investment trade body, with investors lured in by the ease of trading what were previously complex baskets of securities.\par \par \uc2 Most ETFs are based in equities, which accounts for about 9 per cent of the US equities market, according to \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 . But the investment house also said it believes bond ETF assets will double over the next five years from the current level of about $1tn.\par \par \uc2 That is a tricky task; governments and companies all have multiple outstanding bonds at various different maturities and backed by diverse sets of rules and regulations. Up to now, bundling them together into tradable units has been a cumbersome process involving manual construction of baskets of bonds.\par \par \uc2 Portfolio trading in fixed-income ETFs has emerged as way to move large, multibillion dollar blocks of debt quickly between investment banks and asset managers. There were $43bn worth of portfolio trades in 2018 compared to a negligible amount in 2017, \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  found.\par \par \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s new platform is aimed at institutional investors and at brokers creating and redeeming the shares. It will streamline the portfolio trading process further and remove the need to package the underlying securities together manually.\par \par \uc2 ICE\uc2  faces competition from some of the industry\u8217\'20\'19s biggest providers, such as Bloomberg, MarketAxess and \uc2 Tradeweb\uc2 , which has facilitated corporate bond deals worth $21bn in the nine months to September.\par \par \uc2 Ben Jackson\uc2 , \uc2 ICE\uc2  president, said it had developed its hub following industry pressure for a venue that could standardise the industry\u8217\'20\'19s disparate data, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and execution protocols. He described the fixed income ETF market, which has had a compound annual growth rate of 30 per cent over the past 10 years, as \u8220\'20\'1Cred hot\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat this initiative is all about is how can we create some innovation in that primary trading space to help enable and help support the further growth that we\u8217\'20\'19ve seen in the passive investing space,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 The industry is also hoping to benefit from a ruling last month by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , the US markets regulator, that will allow more ETF providers to come to market, and far quicker. In the past asset managers had to apply for so-called \u8220\'20\'1Cexemptive relief\u8221\'20\'1D from existing US mutual fund rules, a cumbersome process that took several months.\par \par \uc2 The first trades on \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s new platform were in equities. Fixed income is expected to be online before the end of the year. In August, \uc2 ICE\uc2  agreed to buy \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s MOVE benchmark indices, which track volatility in fixed income markets.\par \par \uc2 This article has been amended to clarify that the platform creates and redeems ETFs\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191028efas004ed\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Third-quarter adjusted profit before tax was 6 per cent below consensus expectations at $5.35bn as worse than expected revenues and credit losses were only partly offset by better costs.\par \par \uc2 A deteriorating environment for revenue meant \uc2 HSBC\uc2  scrapped a target of delivering at least an 11 per cent return on tangible equity, though consensus forecast had already anticipated the miss.\par \par \uc2 Management also announced a strategic review due by the time of full-year results, saying parts of the group such as in continental Europe and its UK non-ringfenced bank were not generating returns worth the capital they consumed. The review \u8220\'20\'1Ccould result in significant [goodwill] impairment and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and beyond\u8221\'20\'1D, said \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Cairn Energy\uc2  slipped on news that a tribunal investigating its long-running dispute with the Indian government over a $1.4bn tax refund was not expected to conclude until summer 2020, between six and nine months later than previously hoped. The oil explorer also announced its first well offshore Mexico was dry.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  called the tax case \u8220\'20\'1Ca wild card for Cairn\u8217\'20\'19s net asset\u8221\'20\'1D with a value of between 0p and 200p a share. On the failure in Mexico, RBC said the prospect \u8220\'20\'1Cwas a key well in an important new basin for Cairn that could have added around 30p per share to our valuation\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Sellside stories\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 HSBC\uc2  upgraded Drax, the power station owner, from \u8220\'20\'1Chold\u8221\'20\'1D to \u8220\'20\'1Cbuy\u8221\'20\'1D with a 360p target price.\par \par \uc2 The upgrade came after the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  last week confirmed that a UK power capacity market scheme complied with \uc2 EU\uc2  state rules. The \uc2 European Court of Justice\uc2  had ordered the suspension of the capacity market in mid November to review its legality. Companies that missed out on historical payments would be refunded, the \uc2 UK government\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a significant reduction in 2019 earnings uncertainty for Drax,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 HSBC\uc2 . The \u163\'00\'A375m of 2019 capacity payments due to the company compared with an operating earnings target of about \u163\'00\'A3410m, the broker said. The return of the capacity market would also clear the fog around Drax\u8217\'20\'19s expansion plans, in particular whether a new fleet of gas-fired turbines would be economic, it added.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2  downgraded \uc2 Aston Martin\uc2  from \u8220\'20\'1Cneutral\u8221\'20\'1D to \u8220\'20\'1Cunderperform\u8221\'20\'1D with a 400p target price. It said to expect a warning from the automaker at third-quarter results, saw longer-term guidance as unachievable and noted that a rights issue was looking inevitable.\par \par \uc2 Weak near-term demand has hit \uc2 Aston Martin\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s profitability and another cut to margin guidance \u8220\'20\'1Clooks very likely\u8221\'20\'1D, said Merrill. As well as a tough macroeconomic environment, Merrill cited competition from \uc2 Porsche\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s recently relaunched 911 and argued that \uc2 Aston Martin\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s DB11 and Vantage cars were \u8220\'20\'1Calready showing a mid-cycle ageing\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 It forecast \uc2 Aston Martin\uc2  to deliver a 4.3 per cent earnings before interest and tax margin this year, compared with the company\u8217\'20\'19s own guidance of 8 per cent and a consensus expectation of 6.2 per cent. That meant, ahead of \uc2 Aston Martin\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s third-quarter results, the broker cut 2020 and 2021 earnings forecasts by up to 50 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Aston Martin\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s recent debt sale revealed \u8220\'20\'1Csignificant liquidity issues\u8221\'20\'1D with the automaker agreeing an interest rate of about 15 per cent, Merrill said. Another $100m drawdown contingent on securing 1,400 orders for its soon-to-launch DBX model, \u8220\'20\'1Cis only a temporary fix\u8221\'20\'1D, added the broker. \u8220\'20\'1CAston may need to raise more equity in 2021.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Further cash burn expected in the coming years meant \uc2 Aston Martin\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s net debt should rise to \u163\'00\'A31.1bn in 2021, or 3.5 times adjusted trading profit, Merrill said, adding: \u8220\'20\'1CWith significantly increased leverage, we think the company would not be well positioned for any external shock with close to no more borrowing capacity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Trading at an enterprise value of 1.6 times 2020 sales and 15.4 times adjusted earnings, \uc2 Aston Martin\uc2  might look cheap versus sector peers such as Ferrari but \u8220\'20\'1Cmuch weaker financials and execution\u8221\'20\'1D made the comparison wrong, said Merrill. \u8220\'20\'1C[With] another tough set of results, significantly higher cash burn and likely very low guidance, when 2020 guidance is first set, the name will see further downgrades,\u8221\'20\'1D it said.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  downgraded \uc2 Informa\uc2 , the publishing and events group, from \u8220\'20\'1Cneutral\u8221\'20\'1D to \u8220\'20\'1Csell\u8221\'20\'1D with a 723p price target.\par \par \uc2 Businesses across industries \u8220\'20\'1Care facing an inflection point in the mainstream adoption of data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools\u8221\'20\'1D, said Goldman. \uc2 Informa\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s current suite of intelligence and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  products are \u8220\'20\'1Cstill at an early stage and skewed towards end-markets that are facing their own structural challenges.\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 Informa\uc2  therefore requires another investment cycle that will temper margin expansion in the medium term, particularly as the benefit of synergies from its 2018 merger with UBM reduce, Goldman said.\par \par \uc2 Softer macro conditions and trade tensions also made Goldman \u8220\'20\'1Cincrementally more negative\u8221\'20\'1D on growth from exhibitions, which provided 39 per cent of \uc2 Informa\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s total revenue last year. The broker also argued that \uc2 Informa\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s high level of debt would hinder its ability to make acquisitions, particularly as it would be competing with private equity players for data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  companies.\par \par \uc2 Daily newsletter\par \par \uc2 Are you interested in the latest company news?

The price at which units in a unit trust are bought by investors. Includes manager's initial charge. Selling price: Also called bid price. The price at which units in a unit trust are sold by investors.\par \par \uc2 Single price: Based on a mid-market valuation of the underlying investments. The buying and selling price for shares of an OEIC and units of a single priced unit trust are the same. Exit Charges: The letter E denotes that an exit charge may be made when you sell units, contact the manager/operator for full details. Time: The time shown alongside the fund manager's/operator's name is the time of the unit trust's/OEIC's valuation point unless another time is indicated by the symbol alongside the individual unit trust/OEIC name. The symbols are as follows: ? 0001 to 1100 hours; ? 1101 to 1400 hours; ?1401 to 1700 hours; # 1701 to midnight. Daily dealing prices are set on the basis of the valuation point, a short period of time may elapse before prices become available.\par \par \uc2 Yield: Funds comprising mainly of bonds normally quote a gross redemption yield after all charges but before tax has been deducted. Funds mainly made up of equities normally quote a yield representing the estimated annual payout net of tax for basic rate taxpayer. For further information contact the management company.\par \par \uc2 Historic pricing: The letter H denotes that the managers/operators will normally deal on the price set at the most recent valuation. The prices shown are the latest available before publication and may not be the current dealing levels because of an intervening portfolio revaluation or a switch to a forward pricing basis. The managers/operators must deal at a forward price on request, and may move to forward pricing at any time. Forward pricing: The letter F denotes that that managers/operators deal at the price to be set at the next valuation. Investors can be given no definite price in advance of the purchase or sale being carried out. The prices appearing in the newspaper are the most recent provided by the managers/operators.

It has the backing of industry heavyweights like investment banks \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2 , as well as \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest asset manager and one of the biggest ETF providers.\par \par \uc2 The hub offers a platform to help create and redeem baskets of bonds in ETFs, as well as assemble baskets of fixed income ETFs, a fast-growing sector that has spurred some modernisation of the underlying market. It has already gone live with equity-focused ETFs.\par \par \uc2 Over the past 25 years, the ETF market has mushroomed to 2,000 US funds with $3.9tn in total net assets at the end of August, according to ICI, an investment trade body, with investors lured in by the ease of trading what were previously complex baskets of securities.\par \par \uc2 Most ETFs are based in equities, which accounts for about 9 per cent of the US equities market, according to \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 . But the investment house also said it believes bond ETF assets will double over the next five years from the current level of about $1tn.\par \par \uc2 That is a tricky task; governments and companies all have multiple outstanding bonds at various different maturities and backed by diverse sets of rules and regulations. Up to now, bundling them together into tradable units has been a cumbersome process involving manual construction of baskets of bonds.\par \par \uc2 Portfolio trading in fixed-income ETFs has emerged as way to move large, multibillion dollar blocks of debt quickly between investment banks and asset managers. There were $43bn worth of portfolio trades in 2018 compared to a negligible amount in 2017, \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  found.\par \par \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s new platform is aimed at institutional investors and at brokers creating and redeeming the shares. It will streamline the portfolio trading process further and remove the need to package the underlying securities together manually.\par \par \uc2 ICE\uc2  faces competition from some of the industry\u8217\'20\'19s biggest providers, such as Bloomberg, MarketAxess and \uc2 Tradeweb\uc2 , which has facilitated corporate bond deals worth $21bn in the nine months to September.\par \par \uc2 Ben Jackson\uc2 , \uc2 ICE\uc2  president, said it had developed its hub following industry pressure for a venue that could standardise the industry\u8217\'20\'19s disparate data, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and execution protocols. He described the fixed income ETF market, which has had a compound annual growth rate of 30 per cent over the past 10 years, as \u8220\'20\'1Cred hot\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat this initiative is all about is how can we create some innovation in that primary trading space to help enable and help support the further growth that we\u8217\'20\'19ve seen in the passive investing space,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 The industry is also hoping to benefit from a ruling last month by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , the US markets regulator, that will allow more ETF providers to come to market, and far quicker. In the past asset managers had to apply for so-called \u8220\'20\'1Cexemptive relief\u8221\'20\'1D from existing US mutual fund rules, a cumbersome process that took several months.\par \par \uc2 The first trades on \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s new platform were in equities. Fixed income is expected to be online before the end of the year. In August, \uc2 ICE\uc2  agreed to buy \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s MOVE benchmark indices, which track volatility in fixed income markets.\par \par \uc2 This article has been amended to clarify that the platform creates and redeems ETFs\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020191028efas0048t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ga. -- Warren Atchley spent more than 30 years working with mainframe databases, technology that many in his field call "the dinosaur." Then, about three years ago, he found out his job risked extinction.\par \par \uc2 His employer, TSYS, one of the world's biggest processors of credit-card and other cashless payments, was future-proofing its business with a shift away from mainframes to the cloud -- and asked its aging workforce to do the same. Mr. Atchley considers himself an avid learner but was still wary.\par \par \uc2 As a veteran of the old mainframe team, the 59-year-old Alabama native often gave advice to his manager. Yet in his side role on an early cloud-computing team, he was stumped about how to best connect to \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2  to do his cloud work. "I had to go to someone who is younger than all of my children and say, 'Can you help me get this done?' " Mr. Atchley said.\par \par \uc2 From banking to manufacturing, industries are embarking on a digital transformation akin to the Industrial Revolution, but at a much faster speed. Getting the kind of workforce needed to survive in a more automated world will require companies to retrain or replace tens of millions of midcareer workers, labor economists say. People in all sorts of jobs will have to learn new skill sets or risk obsolescence.\par \par \uc2 "Most of us are going to have to face this rebuilding, revamping, reinventing question -- and at frequent intervals in our careers," said \uc2 William Kerr\uc2 , a Harvard Business School professor and co-director of the school's Managing the Future of Work project.\par \par \uc2 Many companies opt to replace people rather than invest in retraining. Two-thirds of U.S. executives recently surveyed by \uc2 McKinsey & Co\uc2 . said they anticipated new technologies would upend the jobs of 25% of their workers over the next several years. More than a third said they would mostly hire new workers with the skills they need.\par \par \uc2 The trouble is, "you just won't find enough of them," Mr. Kerr said, especially in a labor market already in short supply of emerging high-tech skills such as cloud computing and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That was a problem for TSYS, based in a former textile-mill hub 100 miles southwest of Atlanta. The company's geography, and its lack of a tech brand like an \uc2 Amazon\uc2  or \uc2 Google\uc2 , made it challenging to recruit the thousands of cloud-skilled workers it would need. So TSYS turned itself into a laboratory for reskilling a workforce en masse.\par \par \uc2 To retrain its more than 4,500-strong tech staff, or 35% of employees, TSYS had many of them take dozens of hours of online courses. Many also have gone through an immersive two-week digital boot camp, where they use the online training to create a new product or feature.\par \par \uc2 For nearly a year, Mr. Atchley often arrived at work at 6 a.m. and left around 9 p.m.\par \par \uc2 He would come home, say a quick hello to his wife, Elaine, who is also a TSYS employee who has retrained, and then sign onto one of the many online courses he was required to take.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Atchley spent much of a family road trip to New Mexico in the passenger seat, doing coursework on his laptop or his phone while Ms. Atchley drove. His coffee intake, around six cups a day, doubled to 12 on many days in the office. "This is what I need to do to stay in the game," he told his spouse.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Atchley now works full time in the cloud, helping more recently retrained colleagues learn the ropes. He has since received his certification as an \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2  solutions architect-associate, which required even more hours of studying.\par \par \uc2 "I like being out there, learning something someone else might not feel bold enough to try," Mr. Atchley said.\par \par \uc2 Early on in the process, though, enthusiasm for training wasn't as easy to muster with some of his cohorts. TSYS leaders said they expected hundreds of workers to sign up for one of the first digital boot camps. Fewer than 50 applied. Many veteran employees feared that if they struggled with the training, they would end up with no job, or a pay cut if they were moved into an entry-level cloud-computing position, company officials said.\par \par \uc2 Some new-product launches for clients were delayed as the first team of retrained engineers had to do their new jobs while also helping retrain the second and third waves of co-workers behind them. Having employees pull double duty, though, meant TSYS spent just $1.5 million a year to reskill.\par \par \uc2 "This is not easy, going away from what many people here have done for 20-something years," said Patricia Watson, who as TSYS chief information officer spearheaded the retraining effort. "But we knew what we had to do, and it was important that we take our people with us on this journey."\par \par \uc2 The message she delivered to staff boiled down to this: We're facing the biggest technological shift in our history. We will give you the tools to retrain, but it's up to you to decide and put in the time.\par \par \uc2 "We've been very transparent, that 'If you still want to do what you're doing, that's OK,' " she said. "Just know that in about five, six years, we plan to be doing something completely different, and there are certain jobs that will go away."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Watson is leaving the company at the end of October. Last month, more than two years into the retraining, a rival payment-technology provider, \uc2 Global Payments Inc\uc2 ., bought TSYS for $21.5 billion in an all-stock deal.\par \par \uc2 The combined company, with dual headquarters in Atlanta and Columbus, aims to cut $300 million in annual costs by 2022. Executives say there is little overlap with the part of the TSYS business that supports card issuers, where much of the retrained technology staff works, and the reskilling will continue.\par \par \uc2 Darrel Schumm, 63, is among the 9% of the original TSYS tech staff who chose not to retrain. Now a few years away from retiring, he hopes his mainframe job exists until then. He figures that he can add more value keeping the old technology humming while younger colleagues transition to the new.\par \par \uc2 "I can concentrate on what I'm doing, make sure there are no slip-ups," he said. "The others can progress."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20191028000048"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020191028efas0005t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

This month the UK fund industry was rocked by the implosion of \uc2 Neil Woodford\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s eponymous investment business. At the same time, investors on the other side of the Atlantic began draining billions of dollars from \uc2 Fisher Investments\uc2  in response to controversial remarks made by its billionaire founder, \uc2 Ken Fisher\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Woodford, who shot to fame for being able to transform \u163\'00\'A31,000 of investor money into \u163\'00\'A325,000 over 25 years, met his demise after bad bets and heavy exposure to risky hard-to-sell stocks devastated his performance and sent investors fleeing.\par \par \uc2 Mr Fisher, who has been the face of \uc2 Fisher Investments\uc2  since he founded it in 1979, lost the trust of clients for very different reasons. At a conference in San Francisco this month, the veteran investor was reported as making offensive remarks about women. He compared winning over clients to \u8220\'20\'1Ctrying to get into a girl\u8217\'20\'19s pants\u8221\'20\'1D, according to attendees.\par \par \uc2 Mr Fisher subsequently apologised, saying that the comments he made were\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Cclearly wrong\u8221\'20\'1D and that\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Cthis\u160\'00\'A0kind of language has no place in our company or industry\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 But this did not stop large investors redeeming money from \uc2 Fisher Investments\uc2 . At the time of reporting, the company has bled more than $2.5bn, losing mandates from clients including \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2  and several US state pension schemes. A spokeswoman for Iowa\u8217\'20\'19s state pension system said Mr Fisher\u8217\'20\'19s comments had \u8220\'20\'1Cdamaged the credibility of the firm and its leadership\u8221\'20\'1D and may lead to staff turnover, which could have a big impact on investment performance.\par \par \uc2 The controversy has hit Mr Fisher\u8217\'20\'19s reputation and that of the company with which he is synonymous. A regular commentator for the financial press, Mr Fisher was dropped as a contributor by the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  following his remarks.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the crisis affecting \uc2 Woodford Investment Management\uc2 , the incident has not led to \uc2 Fisher Investments\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 demise. The sums pulled from \uc2 Fisher Investments\uc2  so far represent just a fraction of the $112bn the company managed at the end of June, but are a sizeable chunk of the $10.9bn in assets the company manages for \uc2 US government\uc2  clients.\par \par \uc2 But the events at both companies underline how asset managers can be undone by slip-ups made by key individuals with outsize influence over the company.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CKey person risk\u8221\'20\'1D is prevalent in an industry that has long been in thrall to the cult of the star manager. \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 Neil Woodford\uc2  and \uc2 Ken Fisher\uc2  come from a long line of managers who have gone from hero to zero,\u8221\'20\'1D said Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research.\par \par \uc2 Asset management\u8217\'20\'19s past fallen stars include \uc2 Legg Mason\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Bill Miller, Fidelity\u8217\'20\'19s Anthony Bolton and Pimco\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Bill Gross\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In these situations, former star managers and their organisations often see client assets stream out the door as quickly as they flowed in, while previously gleaming reputations can evaporate. When Mr Gross left Pimco in 2014, his flagship Total Return fund \u8212\'20\'14 once the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest bond fund \u8212\'20\'14 haemorrhaged nearly 25 per cent of its assets due to outflows over the subsequent five years, according to data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group Flowspring.\par \par \uc2 Mr Rajan noted that many of the companies hit by a shock linked to a key individual later managed to reverse the trend of negative flows. \u8220\'20\'1CBut in each case, key person risk took its toll on the corporate brand and the bottom line alike,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Some asset managers have learnt lessons from earthquakes such as Mr Gross\u8217\'20\'19s exit from Pimco, choosing to move away from promoting individual stars and focusing on developing a more team-focused culture.\par \par \uc2 But star culture has not been consigned to history yet, said Mr Rajan. \u8220\'20\'1CRetail investors in particular [still] like big names to manage their money.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As the examples of Mr Woodford and Mr Fisher show, companies whose star manager is also their owner or founder can pose a particular problem.\u160\'00\'A0In such cases, the dominance and status of this individual can make them \u8220\'20\'1Cuntouchable\u8221\'20\'1D, preventing colleagues or stakeholders from challenging their behaviour.\par \par \uc2 Jim McCaughan\uc2 , former chief executive of Principal Global Investors, the US asset manager, said such companies sometimes have\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Ca looser approach to compliance and risk controls, together with adverse traits in culture\u8221\'20\'1D. He added that investors\u160\'00\'A0who entrust their cash to these companies need to apply greater scrutiny to prevent the emergence of excesses.\par \par \uc2 Other founder-led investment houses whose flaws have recently been exposed are Carmignac and H2O Asset Management. Investors have fled \uc2 Edouard Carmignac\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s eponymous company en masse in recent years after several of the former star\u8217\'20\'19s high-conviction bets fell short. \uc2 Bruno Crastes\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s H2O, meanwhile, has suffered outflows in response to concerns about its exposure to risky, hard-to-sell assets.\par \par \uc2 Businesses that revolve around their founder are not inherently dangerous.\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Warren Buffett\u8217\'20\'19s Berkshire Hathaway\uc2  is often hailed as a positive example of a company centred on its founder. Even in cases where this individual continues to serve as the symbol of the company, key person risk can be mitigated if the founder delegates authority and puts in place a succession plan for when they step down, said Mr Rajan.\par \par \uc2 For example, \uc2 Jeffrey Gundlach\uc2 ,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 DoubleLine Capital\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s founder,\u160\'00\'A0 has sought in recent years to prove his outfit is more than a one-man show by entrusting his key lieutenants with more power, while remaining the company\u8217\'20\'19s public face.\par \par \uc2 However, it is impossible to eliminate the threat of a key individual crossing the line completely. As with Mr Gross before him, Mr Fisher became well-known because of his outspoken and eccentric personality. But this personality trait later became a liability for both investors.\par \par \uc2 In a recent \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  post, \uc2 Ken Fisher\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s son excused his father\u8217\'20\'19s comments, saying that his \u8220\'20\'1Cbrain is wired differently from most people\u8217\'20\'19s and that is part of why he\u8217\'20\'19s been successful at what he does\u8221\'20\'1D. The executive \u8220\'20\'1Crelates to people differently and doesn't always interpret social cues in conventional ways\u8221\'20\'1D, said Nathan Fisher.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPart of the reason that founder-led companies succeed in the first place is because of the strong personality of the founder,\u8221\'20\'1D said Tim Wright, partner at PwC.\par \par \uc2 Mr McCaughan agreed:\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CConfidence is the good side of the coin, arrogance is the bad side.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For Mr Rajan, this is another sign that the cult of personality in asset management is on its last legs. \u8220\'20\'1CThe spectacular falls of \uc2 Neil Woodford\uc2  and \uc2 Ken Fisher\uc2  have shown once again that all that glitters is not gold,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are witnessing the last gasp of star culture.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191027efar000me\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 JetBlue Airways Corp\uc2 . has gotten into a business that is far removed from flying planes: venture capital.\par \par \uc2 In 2016, \uc2 JetBlue\uc2  took an unusual step for an airline: establishing a hub in Silicon Valley to invest in startups that bring fresh ideas to air travel. JetBlue Technology Ventures is working with the startups on technologies for better customer service, a smoother overall travel experience and timely plane maintenance. Since its launch, the venture operation has scanned around 3,000 companies and invested in 28.\par \par \uc2 The airline sees technology as a way to attract and retain passengers in a market driven by pricing. For instance, the airline is testing a better way of predicting airport weather to help redirect flights and notify customers of possible delays, and personalizing travel by remembering where passengers left off in a movie or show between flights. Another focus is on automating check-in, bag drop and boarding via biometrics, such as facial recognition.\par \par \uc2 Eash Sundaram, chief technology officer of JetBlue and investment-committee member for the venture operation, spoke to The Wall Street Journal about \uc2 JetBlue\uc2 's presence in Silicon Valley and how it fits into the airline's future. Here are edited excerpts.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Why does an airline need a presence in Silicon Valley?\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: The speed to market at which new-generation companies are coming in travel, hospitality and tech spaces is super amazing. When you think about the last five to seven years, companies like \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  and Uber, even the supercharged growth of \uc2 Expedia\uc2 , is happening through the tech space in the valley. We want to have a seat at the table and be the disrupter into the future.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Why is JetBlue Technology Ventures a good way to invest in technology as opposed to having your own tech team?\par \par \uc2 CIO Journal\par \par \uc2 Read more of our premium in-depth coverage designed to help industry professionals monitor and act on decisions that influence policy.\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-claims-breakthrough-in-quantum-computing-11571843751"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Google Claims Breakthrough in Quantum Computing}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/owner-of-coach-brand-fashions-an-it-makeover-11571925601"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Owner of Coach Brand Fashions an IT Makeover}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/colin-powell-reminisces-about-it-overhaul-at-the-state-department-11571779489"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Colin Powell Reminisces About IT Overhaul at the State Department}}}\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: When you think about future-proofing \uc2 JetBlue\uc2 , you have your own challenges running a large $8 billion company in terms of the operational and commercial complexity. Innovation has been in our DNA, but the pace at which the innovation is happening today, it makes it incredibly difficult for the mother ship to just put a process in place to evaluate these startups and make sure there are focused teams around ingesting these startups within the company. This venture-capital unit is driving the innovation within \uc2 JetBlue\uc2  by bringing products in our portfolio that do not exist now.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Are certain innovations crucial to you?\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: One is the way we manage customer experience. It's also very critical for \uc2 JetBlue\uc2  to preserve our cost base and manage it better. Maintenance planning not only drives significant cost but also is key to the safety and security of the airline. A lot of advancements in AI and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  are changing the way these planes are maintained, how these planes are scheduled.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: What kind of startups are helping improve the customer experience?\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: Gladly [a customer-service messaging startup in San Francisco] provides a 360-degree view of customer interaction via multiple channels such as voice, chat or text. When a customer contacts us via phone or email or text during the course of booking through the day of travel, the tool consolidates all these communications into one integrated story line. Customers used to call us or chat or send a message\u8212\'20\'14it never synchronized together in one single view.\par \par \uc2 So our customer-support response time to solve a problem is much shorter compared to the past\u8212\'20\'14I would say 30% to 40% faster in minutes to close that problem. The savings across tens of thousands of interactions a day is a big deal for us in terms of how efficient that contact center could be. We started rolling this out to customer-support crew members in Salt Lake City about three years ago. Now we're looking at an enterprisewide rollout in the next year or so.\par \par \uc2 Making the call\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Are there any interesting ideas you didn't fund?\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: We have said more no than yes. There's a lot more, "It's not the right thing for us, it's not ready for us" than "We made the investment." There are technologies that have come to us that go deeper into customer data. We typically stay away from those kinds of companies. Most companies leverage customer data extensively, and our legal teams are very cautious in terms of how we approach these companies.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: What's the role of your team in the selection process of the startups and technologies?\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: \uc2 Shape Security\uc2  is one of our first unicorns, an investment that we made about two years ago. It's a Silicon Valley-based internet security software company. Security is huge for \uc2 JetBlue\uc2 , whether it's physical security or digital security, so we chose to make this investment in this company. My team was involved in early stages investigation of the company, the investment process, but now my team completely manages that relationship along with my presence on the board, as a board observer. And the product has grown dramatically in the last two years into a much larger portfolio of products that we have worked with Shape to co-develop some of the platforms. Being forefront in this development process gives us a significant strategic advantage for us to competitively work with these companies in the future.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Can you give an example of addressing plane maintenance with respect to JTV?\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: If you think about the new-generation planes that are coming out, they have an enormous amount of data in their engines and in the cockpit that doesn't come back to the base real time. Think about the diagnostics that you can run while the plane is flying, so that when the plane arrives at the airport, you are ready for any type of fixes that need to be put in place.\par \par \uc2 We're thinking about companies like Lumo [a JTV investment], where maintenance planning could be better, which can significantly increase [the time that we utilize planes]. Lumo looks at aircraft maintenance systems within \uc2 JetBlue\uc2 , and it also takes information from the aircraft and gives us long-range predictive planning scenarios for us as to what we need to look for.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Could you talk about new technologies JTV plans to bring to the airline?\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: We have a company called ClimaCell. ClimaCell predicts weather by a few hundred feet. Think about a thunderstorm coming into JFK. ClimaCell uses cell towers to track the transmission from one cell tower to another to monitor precipitation and predict weather to that precise location. It's being tested in a few airports, in parallel to our current systems.\par \par \uc2 If you can predict weather at an airport to the level of the 15- to 30-minute range, multiple diversions can be prevented, our gates can be much more ready. There's a huge impact to our operations in terms of keeping people safe and secure, but also keeping our customers informed on what's going to happen and how to avoid certain diversions and things like that. It's currently in testing phase. We're working with the \uc2 FAA\uc2  on a certification path. These kind of technologies you wouldn't know if you weren't in the valley.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Do you make technologies from startups available to other companies? When do you actually take them in?\par \par \uc2 MR. SUNDARAM: JetBlue Technology Ventures has something called the partnership program. \uc2 Air New Zealand\uc2  partners with us where they get access to our entire ecosystem. When it comes to \uc2 JetBlue\uc2  making an investment, we promote to our partners to try this out. It gives us a wide range of geographic regions and business models to try their product out versus just having access to \uc2 JetBlue\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shah is a reporter for CIO Journal in New York.

Then, about three years ago, he found out his job risked extinction.\par \par \uc2 His employer, TSYS, one of the world's biggest processors of credit-card and other cashless payments, was future-proofing its business with a shift away from mainframes to the cloud\u8212\'20\'14and asked its aging workforce to do the same. Mr. Atchley considers himself an avid learner but was still wary.\par \par \uc2 SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\par \par \uc2 Do you feel pressure to upgrade your skills to be relevant in tomorrow's workforce? How is your company helping you retrain? Join the conversation below.\par \par \uc2 The Alabama native attended a town hall meeting in 2017 with nearly 400 co-workers, many over 45, and asked executives whether he would ever get to use the intense retraining his bosses wanted him to take on.\par \par \uc2 "Or am I the old sheep dog you're going to take out back and shoot in the head once you've got some young puppies ready?" he said. \par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\jpegblip\picw426\pich640\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal6390\pichgoal9600

PHOTO: Dustin Chambers for The Wall Street Journal\par \par \uc2 From banking to manufacturing, entire industries are embarking on a digital transformation akin to the industrial revolution of the 19th and early 20th centuries, but at a much faster speed. Getting the kind of workforce needed to survive in a more automated world will require companies to retrain\u8212\'20\'14or replace\u8212\'20\'14tens of millions of midcareer workers, labor economists say. People in all sorts of jobs will have to learn entirely new skill sets or risk obsolescence, even in the autumn of their careers.\par \par \uc2 "Most of us are going to have to face this rebuilding, revamping, reinventing question\u8212\'20\'14and at frequent intervals in our careers," said \uc2 William Kerr\uc2 , a Harvard Business School professor and co-director of the school's Managing the Future of Work project.\par \par \uc2 Many companies opt to replace people rather than invest in retraining. Two-thirds of U.S. executives recently surveyed by \uc2 McKinsey & Co\uc2 . said they anticipated new technologies would upend the jobs of 25% of their workers over the next several years. More than a third said they would mostly hire new workers with the skills they need.\par \par \uc2 The trouble is, "you just won't find enough of them," Mr. Kerr said, especially in a labor market already in short supply of emerging high-tech skills such as cloud-computing and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That was a problem for TSYS, based in a former textile-mill hub 100 miles southwest of Atlanta. The company's geography, and its lack of a tech brand like an \uc2 Amazon\uc2  or \uc2 Google\uc2 , made it challenging to recruit the thousands of cloud-skilled workers it would need. So TSYS turned itself into a laboratory for reskilling a workforce en masse. \par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\jpegblip\picw640\pich426\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal9600\pichgoal6390

\par \par \uc2 Elaine Atchley, a TSYS software engineer lead, showed an example of the online training the company opted to offer thousands of its engineers. PHOTO: Dustin Chambers for The Wall Street Journal\par \par \uc2 To retrain its more than 4,500-strong tech staff, or 35% of employees, TSYS had many of them take dozens of hours of online courses. Many also have gone through an immersive two-week digital boot camp, where they use the online training to create a new product or feature.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Atchley took an even more intense route. Months after putting his bosses on the spot at the town hall, he was toggling between two jobs, his old one as a senior mainframe expert and a side role on an early cloud-computing team.\par \par \uc2 For nearly a year, Mr. Atchley often arrived at work at 6 a.m. and left around 9 p.m. After putting in 12- to 15-hour days, he'd come home, say a quick hello to his wife, Elaine, who is also a TSYS employee who has retrained, and then sign onto one of the many online courses he was required to take.\par \par \uc2 He spent much of a family road trip to New Mexico in the passenger seat, doing coursework on his laptop or his phone while Ms. Atchley drove. His coffee intake, around six cups a day, doubled to 12 on many days in the office.\par \par \uc2 "This is what I need to do to stay in the game," Mr. Atchley told his spouse. \par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\jpegblip\picw640\pich426\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal9600\pichgoal6390

PHOTO: Dustin Chambers for The Wall Street Journal\par \par \uc2 As a veteran of the old mainframe team, he often gave advice to his manager. Yet in his side gig, he was stumped about how to best connect to \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2  to do his cloud work. "I had to go to someone who is younger than all of my children and say, 'Can you help me get this done?' " Mr. Atchley said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Atchley, an early adapter, made the transition and now works full time in the cloud, helping more recently retrained colleagues learn the ropes. He has since received his certification as an \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2  solutions architect-associate, which required even more hours of studying.\par \par \uc2 "I like being out there, learning something someone else might not feel bold enough to try," he said.\par \par \uc2 Early on in the process, though, enthusiasm for training wasn't as easy to muster with some of his cohorts. TSYS leaders said they expected hundreds of workers to sign up for one of the first digital boot camps; fewer than 50 applied. Many veteran employees feared that if they struggled with the training, they'd end up with no job, or a pay cut if they were moved into an entry-level cloud-computing position, company officials said.\par \par \uc2 Some new-product launches for clients were delayed as the first team of retrained engineers had to do their new jobs while also helping retrain the second and third waves of co-workers behind them. Having employees pull double duty, though, meant TSYS spent just $1.5 million a year to reskill. \par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\jpegblip\picw426\pich640\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal6390\pichgoal9600

\par \par \uc2 Patricia Watson\uc2 , TSYS chief information officer, who spearheaded workforce retraining for the shift to the cloud. 'It was important that we take our people with us on this journey.' PHOTO: Dustin Chambers for The Wall Street Journal\par \par \uc2 "This is not easy, going away from what many people here have done for 20-something years," said \uc2 Patricia Watson\uc2 , who as TSYS chief information officer spearheaded the retraining effort. "But we knew what we had to do, and it was important that we take our people with us on this journey."\par \par \uc2 The message she delivered to staff boiled down to this: We're facing the biggest technological shift in our history. We will give you the tools to retrain, but it's up to you to decide and put in the time.\par \par \uc2 "We've been very transparent, that 'If you still want to do what you're doing, that's okay,' " she said. "Just know that in about five, six years, we plan to be doing something completely different, and there are certain jobs that will go away."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Watson is leaving the company at the end of October. Last month, more than two years into the retraining, a rival payment-technology provider, \uc2 Global Payments Inc\uc2 ., bought TSYS for $21.5 billion in an all-stock deal.\par \par \uc2 The combined company, with dual headquarters in Atlanta and Columbus, aims to cut $300 million in annual costs by 2022. Executives say there's little overlap with the part of the TSYS business that supports card issuers, where much of the retrained technology staff works, and the reskilling will continue.\par \par \uc2 Darrel Schumm, 63, is among the 9% of the original TSYS tech staff who chose not to retrain. Now a few years away from retiring, he hopes his mainframe job exists until then. He figures that he can add more value keeping the old technology humming while younger colleagues transition to the new.\par \par \uc2 "I can concentrate on what I'm doing, make sure there are no slip-ups," he said. "The others can progress."\par \par \uc2 Write to Vanessa Fuhrmans at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:vanessa.fuhrmans@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 vanessa.fuhrmans@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020191027efar001b9\par }{\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

These were some of the surest signs that the opening of the American Dream Meadowlands megamall was finally at hand some 16 years after the starcrossed project was initiated on the New Jersey marshlands, just across the river from Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 We have been here before. "It's been a very difficult process but we're reaching the culmination of all our hard work and efforts," said Don Ghermezian, president of \uc2 Triple Five Group\uc2 , the family-owned development company overseeing the project. That was seven years and nearly $3bn ago.\par \par \uc2 Assuming there are no hitches, the first phase of the American Dream was due to come to life yesterday with a grand ceremony to kick off the opening of its theme park. That will be followed with the christening of North America's largest indoor water park, the ski slopes, and hundreds of shops and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 Much has changed since the project, originally known as Xanadu, was born in 2003. New Jersey has seen five governors since then. The pastel tiles that prompted one of them, \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , to call it "the ugliest damn building in New Jersey" have been replaced.\par \par \uc2 The original developer, Mills Corp, dropped out long ago after running into financial trouble. So did its successor, Colony Capital. \uc2 Triple Five\uc2  agreed to take control of the project in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Above all, the shopping mall, once the mainstay of US retail commerce, is under pressure as never before thanks to the rise of ecommerce. Vacancies in shopping malls hit an eight-year high in the third quarter, according to Reis, a division of Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , with vacancies at their worst level since the financial crisis. As consumers shop online and department stores buckle, many malls are grappling with a glut of space. It would not appear to be the best of times to open a 3m sq ft jumbo mall.\par \par \uc2 "This was conceived 20 years ago, and the world has changed a lot for retail since then," said a well-respected real estate investor. Another questioned whether any department stores, the traditional anchor tenant for shopping malls, would even exist in 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Nor do the mall's trio of helipads overcome the challenge of luring shoppers from Manhattan to a traffic-clogged corner of New Jersey. "How do you get a large number of people from Manhattan to this property in an efficient way?" asked Vince Tibone, a retail specialist at \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 , a property research group.\par \par \uc2 Still, the Ghermezians have not lost their faith in American Dream. They pledged as collateral 49 per cent of the two other megamalls they own the West Edmonton Mall in Canada and the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota to secure a $1.67bn construction loan from \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  to realise their vision.\par \par \uc2 Their conviction is that so many superlative attractions will make American Dream a destination in its own right. Among them: the world's largest indoor wave pool, with a 1.5m gallon water park and beach heated to 31C, a Nickelodeon theme park featuring the world's steepest rollercoaster, a Lego Discovery centre, a Sea Life aquarium, two miniature golf courses, a kosher food hall, an aviary featuring local birds, a KidZania children's village, a regulation \uc2 National Hockey League\uc2  skating rink, and the aforementioned Big Snow indoor ski hill, with two slopes, a chairlift and an Alpine village.\par \par \uc2 Soon to come is a London Eye-style Ferris wheel with a view of Manhattan and perhaps a luxury hotel. On their way to those activities, guests will be funnelled past luxury shops, including a two-storey Herm\u232\'00\'E8s. "It is obviously a very unique retail property, to say the least," Mr Tibone said.\par \par \uc2 The Ghermezians, a family of Iranian Jews, have a history of defying expectations. The family relocated to Montreal in the 1950s and entered the rug trade. They expanded their business until, eventually, they were holding auctions all around the US and Canada, including well-attended sessions at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 Drawn by an oil and gas surge in western Canada, the family ploughed their money into thousands of acres of Alberta prairie, opening a mall in 1981 that featured submarine rides and a man-made lagoon. Five years later, after a visit to Minnesota, they set about repeating the trick on an even bigger scale. These days, the Mall of America pulls in more than 40m visitors a year.\par \par \uc2 "People didn't understand [the concept] and thought it would fail," Mr Ghermezian told Women's Wear Daily in 2012.\par \par \uc2 American Dream will feature the best of those projects, as well as new baubles for an "interactive" generation. One of the reasons construction was so costly is because the Ghermezians ripped out virtually everything from the nearly finished Xanadu when they took over. But this time the Ghermezians are not building in "middle-of-nowhere Canada", as one observer put it. Rather, they will be competing for visitors in one of the busiest urban areas in the world.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, New Yorkers and affluent tourists seeking a luxury mall have a brand new palace at the Related Companies' $25bn Hudson Yards on the west side of Manhattan. It had its own grand opening in March.\par \par \uc2 As if all that were not enough, American Dream is in New Jersey's Bergen County, where trading regulations do not permit Sunday shopping.\par \par \uc2 "It's so big and there's just no infrastructure to make it work," one rival developer said of American Dream's prospects.

A {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/winning-with-ai/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 study released this month }}}\uc2  by MIT Sloan Management Review and \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2  showed that nine of 10 executives said they have made some investment in the technology, yet fewer than two of five reported any business gain from their AI efforts in the past three years. The report is based on a survey of more than 2,500 executives.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Elkan, who headed \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .'s \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  team from 2014 to 2018 before joining Goldman, leads the bank's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/large-companies-centralize-ai-resources-11549620001"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 AI center of expertise }}}\uc2 , established in March 2018. This year, Goldman launched {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-rolls-out-new-etfs-focused-on-artificial-intelligence-11551978432"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 five exchange-traded funds }}}\uc2  that rely on indexes built with \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At the Boston event, Mr. Elkan offered the audience a number of insights from AI projects he worked on at Amazon and Goldman.\par \par \uc2 Here are edited excerpts of his remarks.\par \par \uc2 On the big picture: "You want to start with a big opportunity. Our biggest win [at Amazon] was several billion dollars in revenue, which translates to maybe $100 million in profit because the retail business is actually a relatively low-margin business. How do we get a win of several billion dollars in revenue? We improve a business that already has several tens of billions of dollars in revenue. There's no secret there: Start with something big and then, if you can improve it, you get a big improvement."\par \par \uc2 On project managers: "What I've learned is that you really need a project manager. And if there's a small project, maybe you don't need somebody who's designated as a project manager, you just need somebody who acts as a product manager. So when I interview someone for my team, I'm always trying to figure out: Is this somebody who can be their own product manager?\par \par \uc2 A product manager is the voice of the user when talking to the developers and the voice of the developer when talking to the users. You need to be realistic when talking to users or customers, and you need to be imaginative also. \u8216\'20\'18Here's this technology, we can do something cool with it. Would that be useful to you?' The developers should always be thinking about the customer, asking: \u8216\'20\'18What we're building, is it useful to the customer?'"\par \par \uc2 On metrics: "[One] of the things that a product manager does is quantify the size of the business opportunity. When developing \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  applications, figure out exactly what metrics should be maximized.\par \par \uc2 Just as an example, something my team worked on at Amazon was video recommendations. Product recommendations are a pretty mature field at Amazon, but video recommendations are more open-ended.\par \par \uc2 So what do we try and optimize when we do video recommendations? One idea was, we wanted to maximize the number of minutes that people watch movies and TV shows. But, actually, that's really not a good objective\u8212\'20\'14if you already have someone who's watching 200 minutes a day, then it's probably not beneficial for anyone to drive them from 200 minutes to 300 minutes per day.\par \par \uc2 What we really wanted is customers who weren't watching videos to start watching videos. So we actually spent a long time going back and forth trying to figure out the right metric for that. We ended up on something like the number of weekly active users. So if someone is watching video at least once a week, they're a good customer. And if they're not watching video at least once a week, then they're a less good customer.\par \par \uc2 The number of weekly active users is much closer to the metric that we wanted to maximize than the number of minutes watched. A product manager needs to take the lead in figuring out what you are actually trying to achieve."\par \par \uc2 Write to Jared Council at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jared.council@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jared.council@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROAI20191025efap00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It's the most wonderful time of the year here in the land of Salem witches and Edgar Allen Poe. In other words, Halloween week is coming! This year, I'm thinking of getting a fake lobster claw and hot gluing it to the back of a T-shirt so I could go as a "clawback." But I fear, only you, dear readers, could appreciate that one.\par \par \uc2 This morning's top news is less scary than it is disturbing. As Simon Clark and Will Louch report for The Wall Street Journal, federal prosecutors are investigating whether \uc2 Arif Naqvi\uc2 , the founder of bankrupt private-equity firm \uc2 Abraaj Group\uc2 , bribed senior politicians in Pakistan. Mr. Naqvi, who was arrested in London after U.S. prosecuters indicted him on fraud charges, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Stay tuned for more of this unfolding saga.\par \par \uc2 In other news, \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2  has collected billions of euros for its latest European fund, and bankrupt retailer Barneys New York is moving closer to selling its assets and brands to private equity-backed \uc2 Authentic Brands Group\uc2  and investment firm B.

Prosecutors later added racketeering charges against Mr. Naqvi, who has repeatedly denied the allegations. The prosecutors in New York also added accusations of paying bribes to Pakistani politicians. Part of their current investigation focuses on an alleged bribe they suspect may have been paid via an intermediary to former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shehbaz in 2016, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Carlyle Raises \u8364\'20\'AC6.4 Billion for Latest European Buyout Fund\par \par \uc2 Carlyle Group LP\uc2  collected \u8364\'20\'AC6.4 billion ($7.1 billion) for its fifth Europe-focused buyout fund, which closed almost \u8364\'20\'AC1 billion above its target, the private-equity firm said Thursday. Carlyle Europe Partners V LP brought in commitments from more than 300 investors in 37 countries, the firm said. The new vehicle is roughly 70% larger than the firm's previous Europe-focused fund, which closed in 2015 at its \u8364\'20\'AC3.75 billion hard cap with 140 investors. A person familiar with the firm's plans said in 2017 that its fifth Europe-focused fund would target \u8364\'20\'AC5 billion.\par \par \uc2 Barneys Moves Forward on Sale to \uc2 Authentic Brands Group\par \par \uc2 Barneys New York Inc. is moving forward with the sale of its brand and assets to a licensing company, but the bankrupt retailer hasn't completely shut the door on a rival bidder that would keep its stores open. A lawyer for the luxury retailer, which filed for chapter 11 protection in August, said Barneys will cancel an auction next Monday after no other qualified bidders emerged to challenge a $271 million offer from \uc2 Authentic Brands Group LLC\uc2  and investment firm \uc2 B.

In a news release, \uc2 Virgin Australia\uc2  said it plans to raise more cash with an Australian dollar-denominated offering. The company also said it had obtained a necessary approval for the transaction from the country's \uc2 Foreign Investment Review Board\uc2 . The airline sold the minority share to Affinity in 2014 for about 335 Australian dollars ($228 million), Reuters reported last month, when it said the carrier was expected to pay A$700 million to buy it back.\par \par \uc2 BC Partners\uc2 -backed waste-management company \uc2 GFL Environmental Inc\uc2 . has filed for an initial public offering of shares, saying it could raise as much as $2.11 billion at the $22 a share midpoint of the offering price range. \uc2 BC Partners\uc2  controls about 52% of the Vaughan, Ont.-based company's equity, alongside the \uc2 Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan\uc2  and Singapore's GIC sovereign-wealth fund.

The investment at $6.27 a share is expected to help the company's efforts to construct its Rio Grande liquefied natural gas shipping terminal to export output from Permian Basin wells in Texas and New Mexico. The LNG facility under development is in Brownsville, Texas.

Participants in the Series B financing round also included previous investors Accel, Vulcan Capital and Founders Co-op.

The startup, launched last year, said it had received $8 million through a Series A fundraising in July.\par \par \uc2 Funds\par \par \uc2 BC Partners\uc2  has paid out $2.5 billion to investors from its ninth flagship fund after making its biggest exit with the \u8364\'20\'AC3.25 billion ($3.61 billion) sale of Antelliq, Barrons reported, citing a person close to the situation. The U.S.-European buyout firm led by Chairman \uc2 Raymond Svider\uc2  returned the cash from its BC European Fund IX, which closed in 2016, raising \u8364\'20\'AC7 billion. BC declined to comment. Europe-focused private-equity funds distributed $43 billion to investors in this year's first quarter, according to data from Preqin Ltd. That compares with $152 billion distributed in all of last year.\par \par \uc2 Private-equity firm \uc2 Oak Hill Capital Partners\uc2  is forming a minority equity partnership with Stonyrock Partners, a new private-investment firm backed by \uc2 Jefferies Financial Group Inc\uc2 . Stonyrock, led by veterans of buyout firms \uc2 Blackstone Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Carlyle Group LP\uc2 , targets investments in midsize alternative-asset managers. Craig Schortzmann, previously a managing director with \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 's Strategic Capital Holdings Fund, and Sean Gallary, formerly a Carlyle managing director and head of partnership strategy, set up Stonyrock earlier this year in partnership with Leucadia Asset Management, a unit of Jefferies.\par \par \uc2 People\par \par \uc2 Halifax Group\uc2  has hired Doug Hill as a partner, helping to lead sourcing, evaluation and execution of investments.

The company oversees investments of the school's $40.9 billion endowment. Private equity returned 16% for the year, compared with 9.3% for real estate, 5.9% for public equity and 5.5% for hedge funds. While bonds fared better than hedge funds, returning 5.9%, natural resources and other real assets fell 12.4% and 8.3%, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Noting the substantial outperformance of private-equity investments, which included the endowment's commitments to venture-capital funds, Harvard Management Chief Executive N.P. "Narv" Narvekar said the endowment's venture investments are "notably small" compared with peers. Greater exposure to the sector "would have resulted in a significantly higher return" this year, he added. "Our central concern is that HMC's allocation to buyouts, growth, and venture capital continues to be low relative to what likely makes sense for Harvard," he said. The endowment's target allocation to private equity is 20%.\par \par \uc2 Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc\uc2 . won court approval Thursday for a bankruptcy plan that ousts owner \uc2 Ronald Perelman\uc2  and puts senior lenders in control of the video services company. With the decision, the implementation of the plan will install Sound Point Capital Management, CION Investments, CIFC Asset Management and Invesco Ltd. as the Los Angeles-based company's major owners.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street Democrats are fretting among themselves at work meetings, cocktail gatherings and industry events about the success of Elizabeth Warren, the 2020 presidential candidate who has spent her long academic and more recent political career calling for tighter financial regulation. Interviews with dozens of Democrat-supporting bankers, lawyers and others in New York's finance sector revealed growing anxiety and a sense of powerlessness about the Massachusetts senator, who is now one of the front-runners in national and early state polls. Some may hop on the anybody-but-Warren train, while others may simply abstain from voting if she becomes her party's candidate next year.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal digs into the fall of WeWork and its quixotic founder Adam Neumann, a cliff dive that has little precedent, even in the boom-and-bust world of venture capital.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20191025efap00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It now works with more than 30 insurance carriers, including long-established providers such as Progressive and newer digital carriers like Lemonade and Hippo.\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2 -backed Gradient Ventures led the Series A round. But, initially, finding investors wasn't easy despite the company's fast business growth, co-founder and co-Chief Executive Officer David Stasie said. Many venture firms had already invested in other insurance-technology startups and didn't want to take on another bet in the space, he said.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, venture capital in insurtech is gravitating to late-stage rounds. More than $1 billion was allocated to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-insurance-raises-250-million-from-munich-re-11570442400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 late-stage U.S. insurance startups }}}\uc2  through the third quarter, representing 81% of the total invested in the sector in that period, up from 44% in all of 2018, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro publisher Dow Jones & Co.\par \par \uc2 The number of late-stage insurance deals is likewise growing, representing 40% of the sector's 30 deals done through Sept. 30, the data show. That is compared with about 26% of the 34 deals done in all of 2018.\par \par \uc2 Zach Bratun-Glennon, who led the Young Alfred deal as a partner for Gradient, said it was his third early-stage deal in the insurtech sector in recent months. He acknowledged that "we are not at the beginning of the wave" of insurtech startups raising capital, but said there are many opportunities to invest early.\par \par \uc2 "It's a pretty rich space for applied \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," Mr. Bratun-Glennon said. "With data you can augment and improve multiple aspects of the insurance business," such as underwriting, risk management, the claims process and customer acquisition.\par \par \uc2 The new financing will help Young Alfred form partnerships with online home-buying companies, mortgage providers and other real-estate players who are eager to add insurance-shopping as a service, said Jason Christiansen, the startup's other co-founder and co-CEO.\par \par \uc2 Messrs. Stasie and Christiansen met as students at the \uc2 Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\uc2 , where their pitch for Young Alfred failed at every school startup competition in which they participated. Despite the rocky start, they founded the startup in 2016 and raised $2.35 million in seed funding.\par \par \uc2 Young Alfred now has sent more than 50,000 quotes to potential customers and sold more than 7,000 policies, according to its founders. The company is selling $10 million in premiums annually, they said.\par \par \uc2 Shopping for insurance is often a bad experience for customers, the co-founders said. Unlike some other players, Young Alfred doesn't resell customer information and is able to keep transactions entirely digital by providing binding offers. Insurers pay the company a commission for each policy it sells.\par \par \uc2 Existing investors Pear Ventures, \uc2 Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator\uc2  and Newfund Capital returned for the company's new round.\par \par \uc2 Write to Yuliya Chernova at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:yuliya.chernova@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 yuliya.chernova@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20191025efap00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Insurance technology has become a hot area for venture investors. That is particularly true at the later stages, where more than $1 billion has been invested this year in insurtech. But \uc2 Google\uc2 -backed Gradient Ventures is still interested in backing early-stage startups in the sector. Much more below.\par \par \uc2 Plus, read on for another jaw-dropping yarn from The Wall Street Journal on the company formerly known as WeWork. It involves surfing in the Maldives, the heads of Nasdaq and NYSE putting in their best offer for We's IPO business, John Legend and even a dispute over the type of recycled paper the S-1 would be printed on.\par \par \uc2 And now on to the news...\par \par \uc2 In the News\par \par \uc2 Young Alfred Inc., a New York startup that helps consumers shop for insurance, has raised $10 million in early-stage funding, at a time when the majority of venture investment in insurance startups is going to more mature businesses, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports exclusively.\par \par \uc2 * Young Alfred is an insurance agency with a website where consumers can shop for homeowners' and other types of insurance. It now works with more than 30 insurance carriers, including long-established providers such as Progressive and newer digital carriers like Lemonade and Hippo.\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 Google\uc2 -backed Gradient Ventures led the Series A round. But, initially, finding investors wasn't easy despite the company's fast business growth, co-founder and co-Chief Executive Officer David Stasie said. Many venture firms already had invested in other insurance-technology startups and didn't want to take on another bet in the space, he said.\par \par \uc2 * Indeed, venture capital in insurtech is gravitating to late-stage rounds. More than $1 billion was allocated to late-stage U.S. insurance startups through the third quarter, representing 81% of the total invested in the sector in that period, up from 44% in all of 2018, according to VentureSource.\par \par \uc2 We story. The story of how $40 billion was lost, as WeWork's valuation plunged from $47 billion in January to less than $8 billion this week. The cliff dive by WeWork and its quixotic founder has little precedent, even in the boom-and-bust world of startups. It's especially stark given Mr. Neumann's boundless ambitions: He said WeWork's mission was to "elevate the world's consciousness" and he told people he hoped to be its first trillionaire. Little had changed in WeWork's business between the Hamptons audition and the company's bailout by \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . But by filing to go public, WeWork put its inner workings on display.\par \par \uc2 Layoffs in store. Fair, the online car-leasing startup, is the latest company backed by \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . to announce sweeping layoffs as it struggles to find a path to profitability, the Journal's Heather Somerville reports. The Santa Monica, Calif., business will shed about 40% of its workforce, a company spokeswoman said Thursday. The cuts are equal to close to 300 people, said a person with knowledge of the matter.\par \par \uc2 Gallant, which provides a stem-cell bank for dogs, acquired the veterinary division of Cook-Regentec for an undisclosed amount. Los Angeles-based Gallant has raised a total of $11 million in funding from investors including Maveron, Bold Capital Partners, Bling Capital and Science Inc.\par \par \uc2 Publicly traded Cision said that Falcon.io, its social-media management division, acquired social media marketing insights provider \uc2 Unmetric Inc\uc2 . for an undisclosed sum. The New York-based company was backed by investors including Jafco Asia and \uc2 Nexus Venture Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Educational software provider \uc2 PowerSchool\uc2 , which is backed by private-equity firm \uc2 Onex Corp\uc2 ., agreed to purchase Schoology Inc. for an undisclosed amount. The New York-based company offers a K-12 learning management system, and counts JMI Equity, FirstMark Capital and Intel Capital as backers.\par \par \uc2 Tech News\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2  claims breakthrough in quantum computing. Others, including \uc2 IBM\uc2 , dispute the science behind \uc2 Google\uc2 's experiment.\par \par \uc2 China has \u8216\'20\'18concerning' leads over U.S. in tech, Defense Department official says. \uc2 Michael Brown\uc2  sees lack of government investment, as well as tensions between Washington and Silicon Valley, as part of the problem.\par \par \uc2 Technology companies target the cord cutters. \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , tech startups try to connect more customers to the internet.\par \par \uc2 Federal agencies found to be lax in halting fake comments on proposed rules. Online rule-making comment systems are "being abused," a Senate report says; federal agencies have taken little action, even with comments from dead people.\par \par \uc2 Facial-recognition software was able to identify patients from MRI scans. Study calls attention to a privacy threat that is set to grow as technology improves and medical-imaging data increases.\par \par \uc2 Streaming services compete for tech workers. The industry is booming, and that's good news for people with a range of tech skills.\par \par \uc2 EU wants homegrown cloud Services to rival Amazon, \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 . Legal, security concerns make European companies wary of U.S. cloud providers, which control much of the market.\par \par \uc2 The 5-hour workday gets put to the test.

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 The retail landscape has darkened but will consumers come along for the rides?\par \par \uc2 The man-made snow was piling up on the 16-storey indoor ski slope and workers were testing whizzing rides at the theme park.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 These were some of the surest signs that the opening of the American Dream Meadowlands megamall was finally at hand some 16 years after the star-crossed project was initiated on the New Jersey marshlands, just across the river from Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 We have been here before. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s been a very difficult process but we\u8217\'20\'19re reaching the culmination of all our hard work and efforts,\u8221\'20\'1D Don Ghermezian, the president of \uc2 Triple Five Group\uc2 , the family-owned development company overseeing the project, told a reporter.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 That was seven years and nearly $3bn ago.\par \par \uc2 Assuming there are no last-minute hitches, the first phase of the American Dream will come to life this Friday with a grand ceremony to kick off the opening of its theme park. That will be followed in the months to come with the christening of North America\u8217\'20\'19s largest indoor water park, the ski slopes and then hundreds of shops and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 Much has changed since the project, originally known as Xanadu, was born in 2003. New Jersey has seen five governors since then. The pastel tiles that prompted one of them, \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , to call it \u8220\'20\'1Cthe ugliest damn building in New Jersey\u8221\'20\'1D have been replaced. The original developer, Mills Corp, dropped out long ago after running into financial trouble. So did its successor, Colony Capital. \uc2 Triple Five\uc2  agreed to take control of the project in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Above all, the shopping mall, once the mainstay of American retail commerce, is under pressure as never before thanks to the rise of ecommerce. Vacancies in US shopping malls hit an eight-year high in the third quarter, according to Reis, a division of Moody\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , with vacancies at their worst level since the financial crisis. As consumers shop online and department stores buckle, many malls are grappling with a glut of space. It would not appear to be the best of times to open a 3m-square-foot jumbo mall.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis was conceived 20 years ago, and the world has changed a lot for retail since then,\u8221\'20\'1D said a well-respected real estate investor. Another questioned whether any department stores, the traditional anchor tenant for shopping malls, would even exist in 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Nor do the mall\u8217\'20\'19s trio of helipads overcome the challenge of luring shoppers from Manhattan to a traffic-clogged corner of New Jersey. \u8220\'20\'1CHow do you get a large number of people from Manhattan to this property in an efficient way?\u8221\'20\'1D asked Vince Tibone, a retail specialist at \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 , a property research group.\par \par \uc2 Still, the Ghermezians have not lost their faith in American Dream. They pledged as collateral 49 per cent of the two other megamalls they own \u8212\'20\'14 the West Edmonton Mall in Canada and the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota \u8212\'20\'14 to secure a $1.67bn construction loan from \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  to realise their vision.\par \par \uc2 Their conviction is that so many superlative attractions will make American Dream a destination in its own right. Among them: the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest indoor wave pool, with a 1.5m gallon water park and beach heated year-round to 87-degrees Fahrenheit, a Nickelodeon theme park featuring the world\u8217\'20\'19s steepest rollercoaster, a Lego Discovery centre, a Sea Life aquarium, two 18-hole miniature golf courses, a kosher food hall, an aviary featuring local birds, a KidZania children\u8217\'20\'19s village, a regulation \uc2 National Hockey League\uc2  skating rink, and the aforementioned Big Snow indoor ski hill, with two slopes, a chairlift and an Alpine village serving hot chocolate.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re thinking a lot of people will do ski vacation prep there,\u8221\'20\'1D a guide explained during a recent tour.\par \par \uc2 Soon to come is a London Eye-style Ferris wheel with a view of Manhattan and perhaps a luxury hotel. On their way to those activities, guests will be funnelled past luxury shops, including a two-storey Hermes.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is obviously a very unique retail property, to say the least,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Tibone observed.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The Ghermezians, a family of Iranian Jews, have a history of defying expectations. The family relocated to Montreal in the late 1950s and entered the rug trade. They quickly expanded their business until, eventually, they were holding auctions all around the US and Canada, including well-attended sessions at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan. (A New York\u160\'00\'A0Times reporter who observed one in 1976 described Mr Ghermezian\u8217\'20\'19s uncle, Nader, as \u8220\'20\'1Cmesmerising audiences of up to 800 with his glib chatter and entertaining chant\u8221\'20\'1D.)\par \par \uc2 Drawn by an oil and gas surge in western Canada, the family ploughed their money into thousands of acres of Alberta prairie, eventually opening a mall in 1981 that featured submarine rides and a man-made lagoon. Five years later, after a visit to Minnesota, they set about repeating the trick on an even bigger scale. These days, the Mall of America pulls in more than 40m visitors a year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople didn\u8217\'20\'19t understand [the concept] and thought it would fail,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Ghermezian told Women\u8217\'20\'19s Wear Daily in 2012.\par \par \uc2 American Dream will feature the best of those projects, as well as new baubles for an \u8220\'20\'1Cinteractive\u8221\'20\'1D generation. One of the reasons construction was so costly is because the Ghermezians ripped out virtually everything from the nearly finished Xanadu when they took over.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 But this time the Ghermezians are not building in \u8220\'20\'1Cmiddle-of-nowhere Canada\u8221\'20\'1D, as one observer put it. Rather, they will be competing for visitors in one of the busiest urban areas in the world.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, New Yorkers and affluent tourists seeking a luxury mall have a brand new palace at the Related Companies\u8217\'20\'19 $25bn Hudson Yards on the west side of Manhattan. It had its own grand opening in March.\par \par \uc2 As if all that were not enough, American Dream is in New Jersey\u8217\'20\'19s Bergen County, where trading regulations \u8212\'20\'14 known as \u8220\'20\'1Cblue laws\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 do not permit Sunday shopping.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s so big and there\u8217\'20\'19s just no infrastructure to make it work,\u8221\'20\'1D one rival developer said of American Dream\u8217\'20\'19s prospects. But, knowing the Ghermezians, he could not bring himself to bet against them: \u8220\'20\'1CThey have a tremendous will not to fail.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020191025efap002s4\par }{\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Black patients were less likely than white patients to get extra medical help, despite being sicker, when an algorithm used by a large hospital chose who got the additional attention, according to a new study underscoring the risks as technology gains a foothold in medicine.\par \par \uc2 Hospitals use the algorithm\u8212\'20\'14from Optum, \uc2 UnitedHealth Group Inc\uc2 .'s health-services arm\u8212\'20\'14to find patients with diabetes, heart disease and other chronic ailments who could benefit from having health-care workers monitor their overall health, manage their prescriptions and juggle doctor visits, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Science.\par \par \uc2 Yet the algorithm gave healthier white patients the same ranking as black patients who had one more chronic illness as well as poorer laboratory results and vital signs.\par \par \uc2 The reason? The algorithm used cost to rank patients, and researchers found health-care spending for black patients was less than for white patients with similar medical conditions.\par \par \uc2 "What the algorithm is doing is letting healthier white patients cut in line ahead of sicker black patients," said Dr. Ziad Obermeyer, the study's lead author and an acting associate professor of health policy at the University of California, Berkeley.\par \par \uc2 Optum advises its customers that its predictive algorithms shouldn't replace physician judgment, a company spokesman said. Efforts to use \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  in health care have only scratched the surface of their potential and should be continually reviewed and refined, he said.\par \par \uc2 Optum's algorithm is used by more than 50 organizations, according the company's website. Partners Healthcare in Boston is among those to have used it, according to published research. A Partners spokesman said the hospital system is vigilant about how well its algorithms perform. He added a Partners researcher co-authored the paper, which "is an important step in rooting out some of the flaws that exist."\par \par \uc2 The Washington Post and Science News earlier reported Optum is the algorithm's developer.\par \par \uc2 Algorithms, developed by computers crunching vast data sets, are increasingly shaping choices in medicine, from interpreting medical scans to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2018/12/13/cignas-algorithms-aim-to-predict-opioid-abuse/?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 predicting who might become addicted to opioids}}}\uc2 , suffer a dangerous fall or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-algorithm-aims-to-identify-at-risk-kidney-injury-patients-11564592448"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 end up in the hospital}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Related Reading\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-starts-selling-software-to-mine-patient-health-records-1543352136?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Big Tech Expands Footprint in Health}}}\uc2  (Nov. 27, 2018)\par \par \uc2 The technology can speed up and improve some decisions, leading to better treatment for patients, supporters say. But doctors who get suggestions to tweak their patients' care based on the findings of algorithms often don't know the details of the technology that led to the recommendation.\par \par \uc2 Poorly designed algorithms risk reinforcing racial and gender biases, technology experts caution, as studies of algorithms in nonmedical settings like credit scoring, hiring and policing have found.\par \par \uc2 Algorithms "can give the gloss of being very data-driven, when in fact there are a lot of subjective decisions that go into setting up the problem in the first place," said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor at Cornell University who is also a principal researcher at Microsoft Research.\par \par \uc2 Researchers behind the study said well-designed algorithms could help reduce bias that leads to wide disparities in health-care outcomes and access to care. They created an alternative algorithm that increased the percentage of those identified for extra help who were black to about 47%, up from 18%.\par \par \uc2 "It's a tool that can do a great deal of good and a great deal of bad, it merely depends on how we use the tool," said Sendhil Mullainathan, a University of Chicago computational science professor who was an author of the study.\par \par \uc2 Hospitals and health insurers across the U.S. use the Optum algorithm to spot patients who could benefit from extra help from nurses, pharmacists and case workers, the authors of the study said.\par \par \uc2 To identify those with the biggest medical needs, the algorithm looks at patients' medical histories and how much was spent treating them, and then predicts who is likely to have the highest costs in the future.\par \par \uc2 For the study, data-science researchers looked at the assessments made by one hospital's use of the algorithm. The study didn't name the hospital. The researchers focused on the algorithm's rankings of 6,079 patients who identified themselves as black in the hospital's records, and 43,539 who identified as white and didn't identify themselves as any other race or ethnicity.\par \par \uc2 Then the researchers assessed the health needs of the same set of patients using their medical records, laboratory results and vital signs, and developed a different algorithm.\par \par \uc2 Using that data, the researchers found that black patients were sicker than white patients who had a similar predicted cost. Among those rated the highest priority by the hospital's algorithm, black patients had 4.8 chronic diseases compared with 3.8 of the conditions among white patients.\par \par \uc2 The researchers found the number of black patients eligible for fast-track enrollment in the program more than doubled by prioritizing patients based on their number of chronic conditions, rather than ranking them based on cost.\par \par \uc2 The findings show "how a seemingly benign choice of label (that is, health cost) initiates a process with potentially life-threatening results," Ruha Benjamin, author of "Race After Technology" and an associate African-American studies professor at Princeton University, said in an accompanying commentary in Science.\par \par \uc2 Algorithms are playing an increasing role in medicine, though largely invisible to patients.\par \par \uc2 Doctors are using algorithms to read scans for lung cancer, for instance. Hospitals are deploying the technology to spot which critically ill patients are likely to worsen dramatically. Meantime, health insurers are using algorithms for reasons including to detect patients who are at risk of opioid addiction or who appear headed toward costly lower-back surgery.\par \par \uc2 Alan Muney, a former executive at health insurer Cigna Corp., said it is common for insurers to use the projected cost of care as a focus in selecting who might get extra outreach or support.\par \par \uc2 "It's troubling there was such a big difference" in the effects for black and white patients based on an algorithm focused on cost, he said.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are developing algorithms that include variables beyond medical costs, including issues that might signal barriers to accessing care, such as financial stress and food insecurity, he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Melanie Evans at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Melanie.Evans@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Melanie.Evans@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Anna Wilde Mathews at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:anna.mathews@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 anna.mathews@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020191024efao006el\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc80}{\*\bkmkend toc80}{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw16\pich17\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal240\pichgoal255
