That represents more than half of the 1 trillion yuan total that the \uc2 National Development and Reform Commission\uc2  says lenders and borrowers have signed so far.\par \par \uc2 The agreements allow indebted companies to receive debt forgiveness. In exchange, lenders get equity in those businesses. Other state lenders are dabbling in debt-for-equity swaps, but CCB's participation dwarfs those efforts.\par \par \uc2 The challenge the bank is taking on is huge. Its success will depend in large part on its ability to attract capital from outside investors to help buy loans or invest in converted equity. Analysts expect that in some cases, the bank will contribute only some funds toward the deals, while other parties contribute the majority.\par \par \uc2 Few outside investors have shown interest in contributing capital so far. \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  estimates that CCB has raised funding for only about 10% of the deals it has announced. "Banks' capital constraints will become the main limit on the scale of the scheme, if these entities now start to fund most debt-for-equity deals in this way," the ratings firm said in an analyst report.\par \par \uc2 If CCB's gamble goes wrong, it could be saddled with near-worthless equity. The bank has set up a new subsidiary to execute the swaps and hold the equity, distancing itself from risks, although it is likely that investors will assume an implicit guarantee from the parent company.\par \par \uc2 Analysts also say banks are venturing outside their field of expertise by getting further involved in indebted businesses that need complicated restructuring help. CCB has poured 12 billion yuan into its subsidiary. Whether this subsidiary will have the know-how and resources to take on complicated projects has yet to be seen.\par \par \uc2 For now, the upside for CCB is more political.\par \par \uc2 More than pursuing a solid business opportunity, analysts say CCB is likely trying to align itself with what Beijing wants. The majority of signed agreements so far are in coal and steel, meaning the debt-for-equity program is helping to keep alive businesses that are strategically important to the government.\par \par \uc2 According to people familiar with the matter, Beijing hopes that CCB can set up a model other banks can follow. The bank has a lot of state-owned clients, making it an obvious candidate to give the program some momentum.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Hurricane Harvey Leaves Congress With a Pair of Financial Challenges\par \par \uc2 By Andrew Ackerman, Kristina Peterson and Rachel Witkowski\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Tropical Storm Harvey leaves Congress with a pair of unexpected financial challenges: further shoring up a heavily indebted federal flood insurance program and providing emergency funding for uncovered damage.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers will be under pressure when they return to Washington next week to extend the National Flood Insurance Program after the flooding disaster crippled coastal Texas and Louisiana.\par \par \uc2 The insurance program, created about 50 years ago because private insurers were unwilling to risk catastrophic flood losses, is scheduled to expire Sept. 30. It has a mere $1.7 billion to pay claims and $5.8 billion left that it can borrow from the Treasury, according to the \uc2 Federal Emergency Management Agency\uc2 , which manages the program.\par \par \uc2 Congress likely will have to raise the program's borrowing authority should claims exceed its current cap, these people said.\par \par \uc2 The contentious flood program went through 17 temporary extensions and four lapses during legislative disputes from 2008 to 2012.\par \par \uc2 Another issue lawmakers face is emergency aid to address damage that isn't insured, a process that has been controversial on Capitol Hill in recent years. Many conservative Republicans opposed federal aid after superstorm Sandy slammed the East Coast in 2012.\par \par \uc2 In January 2013, Congress approved a $50.5 billion package to help states rebuild after Sandy, as well as a $9.7 billion increase in the borrowing authority of the flood insurance program.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump said Monday he expects Congress will quickly approve funds to help Texas recover. "As you know, it's going to be a very expensive situation," he told reporters in the Oval Office.\par \par \uc2 Aides from both parties said it was too early to know how much federal assistance would be needed for Harvey recovery. But already, tension among Republicans was apparent, as GOP lawmakers who fought for aid after Sandy noted that many Texas Republicans had opposed it.\par \par \uc2 Among those opposing Sandy relief were then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.), now Mr. Trump's budget director, who said the funds should have been offset by budget trims elsewhere. Only nine Republicans voted for the main Sandy aid in the Senate. Its opponents included both GOP senators from Texas: John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.\par \par \uc2 GOP Rep. Peter King of New York said Saturday on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : "Ted Cruz & Texas cohorts voted vs NY/NJ aid after Sandy but I'll vote 4 Harvey aid. NY wont abandon Texas. 1 bad turn doesnt deserve another." Mr. King added: "As lifelong NYer w/ NY values I will vote for emergency Harvey $ for Ted Cruz's constituents."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz said Monday on CNBC that he opposed the Sandy aid bill because he thought it included spending not tied closely enough to relief.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't think it was appropriate to engage in pork-barrel spending where two-thirds of that bill was unrelated spending that had nothing to do with Sandy," Mr. Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cornyn objected to the final bill for similar reasons, his spokesman said Monday, noting he has backed other relief after natural disasters.\par \par \uc2 AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), said Congress "will help those affected by this terrible disaster," adding that the first step is a formal request for resources from the Trump administration.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have traditionally supported emergency funding without cutting the budget by comparable amounts elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 "Republicans must be ready to join Democrats in passing a timely relief bill that makes all necessary resources available through emergency spending," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said in a statement Monday.\par \par \uc2 "With the National Flood Insurance Program expiring at the end of September, House Republicans must also move swiftly to ensure that affordable flood insurance continues to be available," she said.\par \par \uc2 What makes the debate over the insurance program challenging is that the program already has a debt of roughly $25 billion from earlier weather disasters. Much of that stems from Sandy and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Sandy alone cost $8.4 billion initially, according to FEMA.\par \par \uc2 Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, who heads the powerful \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2 , said the "urgency of the situation" in his home state should put pressure on lawmakers to make sweeping reforms to the flood program.\par \par \uc2 "A long-term reauthorization is within our means and capacity," he said in an interview Monday. "We have an opportunity to open up this marketplace to competition and to make it more affordable."\par \par \uc2 Yet lawmakers from both chambers will only be in session at the same time for 12 days in September and already face a host of thorny fiscal deadlines. Congress must act to keep the government running after its funding expires Oct. 1, raise the government's borrowing limit and authorize new funding for children's health insurance, all at a time of flaring tensions between President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The limited time frame is expected to complicate lawmakers' ability to find consensus on broad changes to the flood program, congressional aides said.\par \par \uc2 While lawmakers agree the program's ills need to be addressed, they have been at odds over how to stabilize it.\par \par \uc2 Protracted fights in the past led to the temporary lapses in the program, causing thousands of home sales to stall, amid disagreements over whether to change how the program works, such as shifting more of the risk to the private sector from taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Regulators, Auto Lenders Dig Into Customer-Refunds Process\par \par \uc2 By Emily Glazer and AnnaMaria Andriotis\par \par \uc2 Regulators are reviewing some auto-lending procedures, including those related to borrower refunds, at several banks and other financing businesses in the wake of problems at \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  and the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  are examining guaranteed asset protection products and the refund processes associated with them at these firms, the people said.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB is focusing on the refunding process, these people added. It isn't clear whether the regulatory reviews will lead to any action.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  previously had disclosed that during an internal review it discovered issues relating to the administration of so-called GAP products, particularly customer refunds.\par \par \uc2 The regulatory reviews are happening as many lenders themselves also check up on their internal controls around the GAP products and related refunds.\par \par \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp\uc2 . , \uc2 Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc\uc2 ., and \uc2 U.S. Bancorp\uc2  are among banks that are reviewing their GAP product refund policies given the situation at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , according to people familiar with the matter. While reviews occur on an ongoing basis, the banks are taking a closer look at procedures meant to ensure borrowers who are entitled to refunds are receiving them, the people said.\par \par \uc2 GM Financial, \uc2 Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp\uc2 ., Infiniti Financial Services and \uc2 Ford Motor Credit Co\uc2 . are among so-called captive-finance companies checking their internal controls and refunding processes as well, people familiar with the firms said. It isn't clear whether the firms will make changes or what those will be.\par \par \uc2 GAP coverage is typically sold to consumers through car dealerships. The products offer consumers additional protection beyond standard auto insurance policies and are often financed as part of the customer's loan.\par \par \uc2 For instance, if a customer has an accident and the vehicle is totaled, so-called GAP waivers could help pay off the loan balance that isn't covered by the customer's primary insurance.\par \par \uc2 Laws in nine states require that customers receive refunds for unused coverage periods and the holder of the contract\u8212\'20\'14the lender\u8212\'20\'14often ensures this is done properly.\par \par \uc2 Some lenders use a third-party provider to oversee the refunding process. Some of those providers, including \uc2 World Omni Financial Corp\uc2 ., have received questions from lenders following news of \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 's problems, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Kenneth Rojc, a lawyer at Chicago-based Nisen & Elliott LLC who manages the law firm's automotive-finance group, said some of his clients are examining whether they have the right procedures in place to implement GAP refunds. That could include how the process works, who provides the refund and whether that firm is doing so in a timely manner, he added.\par \par \uc2 "Every single one of our auto-finance managers here are saying \u8216\'20\'18What are we doing? Is this something we should be concerned about?'" Mr. Rojc said.\par \par \uc2 Auto lenders have reason to be cautious. After \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  cited the problems in a recent quarterly securities filing, The Wall Street Journal and other media reported the San Francisco Federal Reserve made an inquiry about control breakdowns related to GAP refunds. The OCC is also probing \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 's practices.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said in a statement at the time: "During an internal review, we discovered issues related to a lack of oversight and controls surrounding the administration of guaranteed asset protection\u8230\'20\'26products." Ms. Pulley added the bank is working to make the customer refund process "more consistent for customers."\par \par \uc2 Australia's Biggest Bank Faces Ethics Check\par \par \uc2 By Robb M. Stewart\par \par \uc2 MELBOURNE, Australia\u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd\uc2 . faces a broad ethics health check by regulators, as the fallout over alleged money-laundering compliance breaches expanded.\par \par \uc2 In an unusual step, the \uc2 Australian Prudential Regulation Authority\uc2  on Monday said that it would establish an independent inquiry into the nation's biggest bank, focusing on governance, culture and accountability. The move follows a civil suit brought against the bank by the country's financial-intelligence agency and a review by the securities regulator into compliance by the board and senior executives.\par \par \uc2 Following a string of scandals, \uc2 Commonwealth Bank\uc2  has been a focal point for calls by opposition politicians for a judicial review of the banking industry, a move Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's government has deflected with annual parliamentary quizzing of bank executives and plans for a new consumer complaints authority and an accountability regimen for executives.\par \par \uc2 Commonwealth Bank\uc2  was among several financial institutions in the country to have faced claims of offering poor financial advice in recent years and has also been accused of failing to honor insurance claims. This month, the \uc2 Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre\uc2  filed a federal court suit alleging the bank contravened the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act more than 53,700 times, each carrying a maximum penalty of 18 million Australian dollars (US$14.3 million).\par \par \uc2 The goal of the inquiry is to identify possible organizational and cultural shortcomings that may have led to scandals that have shaken public confidence, said Wayne Byres, chairman of the prudential regulator.\par \par \uc2 "The Australian community's trust in the banking system has been damaged in recent years, and CBA in particular has been negatively impacted by a number of issues that have affected the reputation of the bank," he said. "Given its position in the Australian financial system, it is critical that community trust is strengthened."\par \par \uc2 The inquiry has \uc2 Commonwealth Bank\uc2 's full support, Chief Executive \uc2 Ian Narev\uc2  said. "Over the last few years there have [been] a number of highly publicized issues that have hurt public perception. We've been in the news for all the wrong reasons," he said.\par \par \uc2 The inquiry panel will take about six months to produce a report that will be made public, the regulator said. Members of the panel have yet to be finalized, but the cost of the review will fall on the bank.\par \par \uc2 The inquiry wouldn't specifically address matters that overlap with legal proceedings or reviews by other regulators.\par \par \uc2 "Australia's banks are well-capitalized, well-regulated and financially sound. However, there have been too many cases and events that have damaged their reputation and standing in the eyes of many Australians that warrants our regulators taking action now," Australia Treasurer Scott Morrison said. Mr. Morrison recently met with Commonwealth Bank Chairman \uc2 Catherine Livingstone\uc2  in the wake of accusations made by the \uc2 Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre\uc2 , or \uc2 Austrac\uc2 , and made it clear the government would be considering all options to address the matter.\par \par \uc2 Days after \uc2 Austrac\uc2 's case was filed, Mr. Narev said he would step down by mid-2018. The CEO and senior bank executives lost out on short-term bonuses for the last year through June in the wake of the allegations.\par \par \uc2 Austrac\uc2 's allegations center on the use of the bank's "intelligent deposit machines," which allow anonymous deposits of up to A$20,000 in cash at a time to be automatically credited to accounts. \uc2 Austrac\uc2 's allegations largely relate to a failure to provide timely reports on transactions above a A$10,000 threshold for over three years from 2012, as well as accusations it failed to report suspicious transactions on time or at all, and of not monitoring customers even after it became aware of suspected money laundering.\par \par \uc2 The bank has yet to file a response in court but has said a coding error introduced with a software upgrade accounted for the vast majority of reporting failures alleged by the agency.\par \par \uc2 With the lawsuit, the \uc2 Australian Securities and Investments Commission\uc2  has begun its own inquiries to determine whether the bank's directors and executives complied with their duties and if the bank had met licensing and disclosure obligations.\par \par \uc2 Critics of Troubled Insurer Dogged by Mysterious Approaches\par \par \uc2 By Mark Maremont\par \par \uc2 Critics of \uc2 AmTrust Financial Services Inc\uc2 ., which is being probed by a regulator and pressured by investors, say they have been approached by a series of purported overseas consultants dangling enticing offers. Afterwards, the critics discover these people aren't who they say they are.\par \par \uc2 Chris Irons, an analyst at research firm GeoInvesting LLC, which has published several reports critical of AmTrust's accounting practices, said he was contacted in July by a woman who identified herself as a London-based consultant to a European software multimillionaire seeking contributors to a new investment website. He agreed to meet at a Philadelphia-area restaurant.\par \par \uc2 At the dinner, Mr. Irons said, the woman, whom he described as gorgeous, plied him with drinks and slipped in several questions about critiques of AmTrust and its accounting methods. "It was the second or third follow-up question on AmTrust that gave me a lot of pause," he said, adding that she "laughed at many things I said that probably weren't that funny."\par \par \uc2 But the name the woman gave\u8212\'20\'14 Diana Ilic \u8212\'20\'14appears to be a pseudonym. The email address she used with Mr. Irons links to a domain name established a few days before the meeting. The London address for her consulting firm turns out to be a mailbox drop.\par \par \uc2 A woman who made initial contact on social media on behalf of the purported Ms. Ilic doesn't appear to be who she said she was either. The social-media pages under her name used photos of another woman, a French retail marketer. The purported Ms. Ilic didn't return phone calls or emails to the contacts provided to Mr. Irons.\par \par \uc2 AmTrust, a fast-growing, New York-based insurance company with $5.5 billion in 2016 revenue, in recent years has attracted skepticism about its results from investors betting against its stock, which has nearly halved this year. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported this year that the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  was investigating AmTrust's accounting practices.\par \par \uc2 Other AmTrust critics described similar odd approaches to The Wall Street Journal, including an investor who is betting against AmTrust's stock; a journalist who has published articles critical of AmTrust's founders; and Mr. Irons' boss, who said he'd met two months earlier with a different "consultant" dangling a lucrative offer, who then brought up AmTrust.\par \par \uc2 That consultant, the GeoInvesting team later found, used the same London mail-box drop as Ms. Ilic.\par \par \uc2 Battles between companies and short sellers sometimes turn nasty and both sides in such disputes occasionally have used private investigators to dig up information, usually in a legitimate fashion. The investigators often are hired through law firms and the information sometimes is used in litigation.\par \par \uc2 An AmTrust spokeswoman said the company didn't employ investigators to probe its critics. It declined to say whether its lawyers or others in its service had done so. The company has declined to comment on the SEC probe.\par \par \uc2 AmTrust this year restated some results with relatively minor changes after switching outside auditors.\par \par \uc2 Investigators using fake identities and misrepresentations could run afoul of several state and federal laws, said Gavin P. Lentz, a Philadelphia attorney and former prosecutor, who isn't involved in the matter. A company that hires such investigators potentially could be held civilly liable, Mr. Lentz said, because these are agents acting on their behalf.\par \par \uc2 "Generally speaking, as a private investigator you can't misrepresent yourself" in the U.S., said James Cesarano, vice president of ethics and compliance at \uc2 Kroll Associates Inc\uc2 ., a corporate investigations firm.\par \par \uc2 In 2016, AmTrust said it hired private Israeli investigators claiming to be consultants to secretly tape a former Italian business partner in Italy, according to a lawsuit AmTrust filed last year against the former partner.\par \par \uc2 The parties settled after the tape allegedly revealed the former partner had offered a bribe to an arbitrator. Both parties said the settlement was confidential and the former business partner said in a text message that he didn't "corrupt anyone."\par \par \uc2 AmTrust has been in a long-running battle with short sellers\u8212\'20\'14investors who bet against its stock\u8212\'20\'14and other critics, who have claimed the insurer burnishes its financials partly by underestimating future claims and through reinsurance transactions with overseas affiliates that had the effect of hiding losses.\par \par \uc2 AmTrust, which denies such allegations, several years ago filed a legal notice threatening to sue GeoInvesting and a vocal short seller, Casey Nelson. AmTrust also has attacked short sellers several times on investor conference calls. On a May call, CEO \uc2 Barry Zyskind\uc2  called short seller claims "false" and "baseless."\par \par \uc2 The ostensible consultants contacting AmTrust critics have legitimate-seeming websites and social-media identities. They also leave little apparent trace of their whereabouts. The woman who called herself Ms. Ilic, for example, arrived and left in an ordinary taxi and paid for the meal with cash, Mr. Irons said.\par \par \uc2 Roddy Boyd, who has written articles for his Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation that raised questions about charitable foundations run by AmTrust's founders, said he received two unusual approaches.\par \par \uc2 A few months ago, he said, a man claiming to be calling from London offered to donate money to his journalistic foundation, in return for answering questions about AmTrust. Mr. Boyd said he provided a few generalities about the company and told the man not to donate.\par \par \uc2 In mid-2016, Mr. Boyd said, he traveled to London to meet a man identifying himself as a Hong Kong-based adviser to a wealthy family interested in starting an Asian journalism venture. The consultant, he recalls, asked detailed questions about his articles on AmTrust founders.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Boyd said he later discovered the consultant's background had holes; his Hong Kong phone number has since been disconnected. "Something was very wrong," Mr. Boyd said. He said the consultant was armed with a printout of an AmTrust critique by Mr. Nelson, the short seller.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Nelson, of Dallas-based \uc2 Alistair Capital Management LLC\uc2 , said he was contacted around the same time by a London-based consultant, purporting to represent a Middle Eastern investor looking to hire Mr. Nelson's firm to manage at least $50 million.\par \par \uc2 He said the man offered to fly him to London to discuss the offer. Mr. Nelson said he was suspicious and declined the offer. The consultant's email address is no longer active; his website domain was registered to a mailbox drop address.\par \par \uc2 The Israeli firm employed by AmTrust in the Italian matter, Black Cube, has an office in London. Black Cube declined to comment, saying it can't discuss clients "or the work we have done for them, if any." The firm said its work always complies with local laws.\par \par \uc2 GeoInvesting co-founder Dan David \u8212\'20\'14Mr. Irons's boss\u8212\'20\'14this month filed a civil suit in a Pennsylvania state court against the woman who identified herself as Ms. Ilic and a second purported consultant who contacted Mr. David in May, also asking questions about AmTrust. AmTrust wasn't named in the suit.\par \par \uc2 Though this second consultant said he was French, Mr. David\u8212\'20\'14whose wife is French\u8212\'20\'14believed the man spoke English with an Israeli accent. The consultant didn't return calls or emails sent to the contact information he gave Mr. David. The legal action allowed Mr. David to get subpoenas for security-camera footage of the meetings with the consultants, in the hope of identifying them.\par \par \uc2 Pakistani Bank to Shut N.Y.

The bank said the closure wouldn't have a material effect on its business outside the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The NYDFS alleged in its statement of hearing that Habib Bank struggled to comply with New York banking laws since 2006, and that it has been plagued by "repeated breakdowns" in its sanctions and money laundering compliance programs, with violations occurring every year since that time other than in 2009.\par \par \uc2 Habib Bank was also subject to an exam in March 2016 cited in the NYDFS statement that had found "significant weaknesses" in the New York branch's risk management capabilities, and that, despite repeated criticism from the NYDFS, "management had yet to implement effective controls" to mitigate and manage its money laundering and sanctions risks.\par \par \uc2 The NYDFS also said, in separate orders dated Aug. 24, that its probe of Habib Bank's compliance programs would continue after the New York branch's closure, and that it would expand the window of transactions it seeks to review for potential sanctions-compliance violations.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Trading Spikes in Gasoline ETF\par \par \uc2 Trading in the United States Gasoline Fund (UGA) soars to the highest in almost six years after Hurricane Harvey knocks out refining operations in Texas.

Investor advocates might sue the administration if it attempts to water down the rule, but that could lead to further delays, according to the editorial.\par \par \uc2 Fed Officials Should Steer Clear of Politics\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's defense of postcrisis financial regulations last week, coupled with earlier comments in the same vein from Fed No. 2 Stanley Fischer, show that "Fed officials are launching a political campaign to retain their vast discretionary control over the American financial system," writes {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/our-political-central-bankers-1503961596"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Wall Street Journal's editorial board}}}\uc2 . Banks are safer now than before the crisis, the editorial says, but that makes sense after years of economic placidity. A better approach is "a financial regime with high levels of capital to defend against potential losses but with less regulatory micro-managing," the board writes.\par \par \uc2 The House Ethics Committee said it is investigating Rep. Chris Collins (R., N.Y.) after an advocacy group requested a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/APc33d5b4cd9694926be7d56661ed0f5e8"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 probe into possible insider trading}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The stock market is having a good year. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/08/28/bitcoin-valued-like-a-blue-chip-trading-like-a-small-cap/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bitcoin is having a better one.}}}\uc2  At the end of last week, the digital currency was up 352% year to date.\par \par \uc2 The Hong Kong stock exchange's 31-year-old trading hall is set to close this fall, but not without some {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-brokers-make-final-stand-against-trading-floors-demise-1503921255"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pushback from its remaining tenants}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Confidence in Qatar's creditworthiness took another hit, as \uc2 Fitch Ratings{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-is-downgraded-by-fitch-as-blockade-takes-a-toll-1503923664"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 downgraded the country's debt}}}\uc2 , citing concerns that the economic blockade imposed by Arab neighbors was unlikely to be lifted soon.\par \par \uc2 Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.

In recent interviews with other publications they alleged Amazon took advantage of their partnership to raid Nucleus's ideas and development process.\par \par \uc2 Alexa Fund\par \par \uc2 The Firm\par \par \uc2 Amazon unveiled the Alexa Fund in 2015 with $100 million.\par \par \uc2 The Team\par \par \uc2 The fund operates out of Amazon's corporate development team, led by Director of Worldwide Corporate Development Paul Bernard.\par \par \uc2 The Strategy\par \par \uc2 Amazon's fund backs startups working on voice technologies, including those developing new capabilities for the Alexa Skills Kit or the Alexa Voice Service.\par \par \uc2 Recent Deals\par \par \uc2 The Alexa Fund recently invested in a $300 million round for smartphone maker Essential Products Inc. and a $50 million Series B round for tracking device maker TrackR Inc.\par \par \uc2 "We've been working on Echo Show and Alexa calling and messaging for a long time," said an Amazon spokeswoman. "Work on both was already well underway before we had our first discussion with Nucleus and was not influenced by those discussions."\par \par \uc2 Nucleus, whose legal name is CloudTalk Inc., is among the more than 20 startups Amazon has backed from its $100 million Alexa Fund. The fund represents one of several efforts by Amazon to cultivate a developer ecosystem around its voice-controlled \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  assistant, which Amazon hopes will become the hub of the American "smart home." Amazon's backing comes with risks and rewards, said entrepreneurs and investors racing to fill the "smart home" with voice-controlled, internet-connected products.\par \par \uc2 Amazon declined to make the fund's investing team available for comment.\par \par \uc2 Startups backed by Alexa Fund get special access to the Amazon mothership. Such companies receive some early peeks at the road map for Alexa, as well as inside help in designing and implementing Alexa-integrated features, said both the Amazon spokeswoman and chief executive officers of portfolio companies. For example, the companies had early notice that Amazon would introduce programming tools to connect a camera, said Jamie Siminoff, CEO of \uc2 Bot Home Automation Inc\uc2 ., the maker of a connected video doorbell that does business as Ring. "You get access to a person who can help you navigate Amazon," said Chris Herbert, CEO of tracking device maker TrackR Inc. He said his company worked with Amazon staff to develop TrackR's user experience and beta test its Alexa skills.\par \par \uc2 Even with those rewards on the table, some venture capitalists said they would advise companies to be wary about accepting Amazon's investment, because of the risk of Amazon copying ideas.\par \par \uc2 It isn't new for corporate venture-capital programs to get ideas from the startups they back, and even imitate them. With Amazon, a company that has designs on just about every industry, the concerns are bigger, said investors who watch the market for home Internet-of-Things products. A central concern is that information shared with the Alexa Fund team may make its way to Amazon's first-party product team, these investors said.\par \par \uc2 But the Alexa Fund has "measures in place" to ensure portfolio companies' confidential information is treated appropriately, the Amazon spokeswoman said. Still, the fund does introduce portfolio companies to other Amazon departments\u8212\'20\'14including the Alexa product team\u8212\'20\'14often at the companies' request, she said.\par \par \uc2 "We do not incorporate any Alexa Fund portfolio companies' confidential information into Amazon products\u8212\'20\'14we independently design and build our own devices and work with select Alexa Fund portfolio companies around licensed integrations of their technology," said the Amazon spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 Venrock Partner David Pakman said, "As a venture investor and former startup CEO, you have to be paranoid." Mr. Pakman said he has invested in several startups that have had conversations with the Alexa Fund. Many investors who back smart home devices urged caution, but said they wouldn't tell companies to rule out accepting Amazon's backing.\par \par \uc2 "You always have to be careful with Amazon. Anybody that big and that aggressive, you don't want to underestimate," said David Wu, a general partner at venture firm Maveron.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hurricane Harvey will take a financial toll on the nation's economy, but how much of one depends on the extent of flooding in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 Even after the immediate threat from Hurricane Harvey has passed and the floodwaters receded, the Texas Gulf Coast faces tens of billions of dollars in property damage, bottlenecks at some of the nation's largest oil refineries, and work disruptions possibly for millions of workers.\par \par \uc2 "The damage will likely be much higher than most recent hurricanes have been," said Adam Kamins, senior economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . There are "very high levels of housing density where some of the most severe flooding is taking place. Because of that you have very high expected property and vehicle damage."\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the storm could affect the economy nationwide due to the large oil refining presence in the Gulf Coast. Refiners in Corpus Christi, Lake Charles and Houston have about 30% of the nation's oil refining capacity.\par \par \uc2 Gasoline futures rose 7 cents to $1.74 a gallon on the \uc2 New York Mercantile Exchange\uc2  on Monday. That is likely to be temporary.\par \par \uc2 Gasoline prices have typically peaked within two weeks of major storms, rising by 20 to 80 cents a gallon, said Rick Joswick, managing director of global oil for PIRA Energy, an \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  unit of S&P Global Platts. Prices typically return to their prestorm levels, or somewhat lower, within two to four weeks.\par \par \uc2 The "outlook is for gasoline prices to spike by a similar degree for the next week or so," Mr. Joswick said.\par \par \uc2 The biggest hit from any storm is to insurers and property owners. \uc2 Moody's\uc2  preliminary estimate is that the storm will cause between $30 billion and $40 billion of property damage. Mr. Kamins cautions these are initial estimates and could change significantly depending on how the storm evolves.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, the \uc2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\uc2  estimates that Hurricane Ike, which hit Texas and Louisiana in 2008, caused about $29 billion of damage, while Hurricane Rita in 2005 cost about $12 billion. If the \uc2 Moody's\uc2  estimate proves correct, it would be considerably less damage than 2005's Hurricane Katrina, which caused over $100 billion in damage. Superstorm Sandy of 2012 is estimated to have caused $71 billion in damage.\par \par \uc2 Most of Hurricane Harvey's economic impact will be concentrated. The Houston area is the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan economy, with about 3.1 million workers who generate over $500 billion of economic activity a year.\par \par \uc2 It remains unclear how long Houstonians and other Texans will be dealing with closed stores or idled and unreachable workplaces, but \uc2 Moody's\uc2  estimates thus far that there will be $6 billion to $8 billion in lost output in the weeks ahead. That is barely perceptible in a U.S. economy that produces more than $19 trillion worth of goods and services annually.\par \par \uc2 Even the largest storms have typically not permanently damaged the U.S. economy. This is in part because storm often spark construction booms that employ tens of thousands of people to clean up and rebuild.\par \par \uc2 Gross domestic product doesn't account for property damage but it does account for rebuilding, so the measure can climb after storms due to activity involved in rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 Other economic measures could be skewed in the weeks ahead. The initial weeks after similarly large storms have sometimes produced rising claims by waylaid workers for unemployment insurance. After Hurricane Katrina, jobless claims climbed by over 100,000 a week.\par \par \uc2 Michael Feroli and Daniel Silver, economists at \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., said in a note that other signs of the storm's impact could be seen in industrial production data, which will show the effect of power outages on utilities, and in personal spending data.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170829000048"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170829ed8t0001b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The 21st Century Cures Act was hailed as the biggest health-care reform since ObamaCare. It's easy to see why: The law, which passed both houses of Congress by unanimous consent last December, increased the budget of the \uc2 National Institutes of Health\uc2 , designated nearly $2 billion for cancer research, and set aside $500 million in 2017 alone to address the opioid crisis.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, the legislation also weakened patients' privacy rights. Americans were already vulnerable under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. That law allowed government-funded researchers to collect and even share patients' medical and genetic information without their consent. But the 21st Century Cures Act goes further. In an effort to promote medical breakthroughs, the law tries to create an "information commons": a government-regulated pool of data accessible to all health researchers, regardless of background, training or motive.\par \par \uc2 Although speeding research is a noble goal, there's little evidence that patients are willing to sacrifice their privacy the way that the 21st Century Cures Act requires. A 2007 survey by the \uc2 Institute of Medicine\uc2  found that only 1% of Americans were willing to have their health information shared for research without their consent. Yet the new law doesn't give patients in government-funded research any method to opt out of data sharing. It prohibits "information blocking" by health-care providers, essentially mandating that doctors and hospitals share data with government researchers. It encourages the creation of a "global pediatric clinical study network" to pool data on children world-wide.\par \par \uc2 Federal courts have upheld forced data sharing because patients "voluntarily" give personal health information to their doctors. Some jurists and legal scholars, however, argue that today's laws don't adequately protect privacy. Consider the Supreme Court's unanimous 2012 decision in U.S. v. Jones. "It may be necessary," Justice \uc2 Sonia Sotomayor\uc2  wrote in a concurring opinion, "to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties." Although that case was about law-enforcement surveillance, Justice Sotomayor's warning that the current privacy laws are "ill suited to the digital age" applies equally to medical research.\par \par \uc2 In theory, the data shared under the 21st Century Cures Act can't be traced back to individual people. It's stripped of direct identifiers like names, street addresses and Social Security numbers. But with \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  virtually everything is traceable. A few years ago Harvard researchers examined about 600 anonymized profiles from a genome-research project. Participants had provided a few small pieces of information: birth date, sex and ZIP Code. By comparing that against public records and voter data, researchers were able to identify nearly half of these people by name. The same approach could work on medical records containing sensitive information about alcoholism, illegal drug use or sexual abuse.\par \par \uc2 Even if researchers stopped asking for birth date, sex and ZIP Code, anyone with an internet connection and a decent understanding of biology could link genetic data to individual patients. In 2013 a group of researchers led by MIT's Yaniv Erlich took anonymous genetic information and cross-referenced it against a public database genealogists use to match small differences in Y chromosomes with certain family trees. That helped establish the anonymous donors' surnames, which were then cross-referenced with other public records, like voter and tax rolls. In this way the researchers were able to identify dozens of completely "anonymous" people.\par \par \uc2 The 21st Century Cures Act isn't the only federal legislation that threatens patient privacy. A bill introduced in March by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R., N.C.), the Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act, would give companies leverage to push genetic tests on their workers. Those who opt out could have their insurance premiums raised by up to 50%.\par \par \uc2 This genetic-testing requirement could quickly lead to discrimination, since companies would have an enormous incentive to avoid hiring people at high risk of serious illness. Although managers might never admit to firing people with risky genetic profiles, they could give these workers bad reviews or deny raises to force them to quit.\par \par \uc2 When the Founding Fathers wrote the Fourth Amendment, which protects against "unreasonable searches and seizures," they were thinking of abusive government agents kicking down doors. But with modern technology, state officials and big companies don't need to resort to brute force. In the internet age, they can get sensitive information from the comfort of their offices -- and the law allows them to do just that.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Ms. Brase, a registered nurse, is president of the Citizens' Council for Health Freedom.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170829000020"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170829ed8t0000j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 More bad news for Houston: Many of the homes and businesses that have been inundated by Hurricane Harvey aren't insured for flooding.\par \par \uc2 Data provider \uc2 CoreLogic\uc2  says 52% of the residential and commercial properties in Houston that are at high or moderate risk of flooding due to Hurricane Harvey aren't in federally designated flood zones.\par \par \uc2 Most residential flood insurance is provided by the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program, which also insures some businesses.\par \par \uc2 Federal flood maps are generally used to determine which property owners need to buy flood insurance. Homeowners in flood zones, for example, are required to maintain the coverage by their mortgage companies.\par \par \uc2 Those outside federally designated flood zones aren't required to buy the expensive protection, and often forgo it. Standard homeowners policies don't cover flood damage.\par \par \uc2 The storm also poses new hazards to the federal flood insurance program, a giant insurer that is already facing mounting debt and a reauthorization fight in Congress.\par \par \uc2 The program, created about 50 years ago because private insurers were unwilling to risk catastrophic flood losses, could be inundated with billions of dollars in new claims following Harvey's initial Category 4 winds and colossal rainfall.\par \par \uc2 Yet it is scheduled to expire on Sept. 30 and has just $5.8 billion left it can borrow from the Treasury to meet new claims, according to January figures reported to Congress. Many people buy the government policies through private-sector insurers, which are compensated for that service.\par \par \uc2 Members of Congress are discussing a number of options, ranging from a temporary renewal of the program to a more-comprehensive fix designed to return the program to solvency. Congress returns from recess on Sept. 5.\par \par \uc2 "From a public-policy perspective, Hurricane Harvey reinforces the narrative of why the national flood-insurance program is so important," said Christopher Gillott, legislative director for \uc2 Sen. Bill Cassidy\uc2  (R., La.).\par \par \uc2 What makes the debate in Washington so challenging is that the program already has a debt of roughly $25 billion from earlier weather disasters.Much of that is from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and superstorm Sandy in 2012. Sandy alone cost $8.4 billion initially, according to the \uc2 Federal Emergency Management Agency\uc2 , which manages the program.\par \par \uc2 The program had to borrow another $1.6 billion from the Treasury in January just to pay interest on its debt and storm claims, according to FEMA.\par \par \uc2 It will take days, if not weeks or longer, for claims to emerge from Harvey. More than 200,000 homes along the Texas coast could be at risk, according to information and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 CoreLogic\uc2 . In 30 Texas counties labeled disaster areas by the state's governor there are nearly 450,000 NFIP policies covering $125.7 billion in insured value, according to the program's website. More than half of that value is in Harris County, which includes Houston.\par \par \uc2 Sticking points in Congress over the program include whether lawmakers will address its finances in part by increasing rates gradually for homeowners who pay well below the actuarial risk of flooding.\par \par \uc2 Critics have said many policyholders are getting bargain rates compared with what private-sector insurers would require and that taxpayers in drier areas are subsidizing those in flood-prone states.\par \par \uc2 Roughly a dozen senators are proposing legislation that would adjust homeowners' rates to be more in line with a property's risk, and create incentives for private insurers to take on more policies. But that package, led by \uc2 Sen. Bob Menendez\uc2  (D., N.J.), is unlikely to pass next month since Congress would have only a few weeks to address it, according to Senate staff members.\par \par \uc2 The two top leaders of the Senate Banking Committee recently introduced a separate, simpler bill: It would renew the program for six years without getting into the more controversial financial woes. Lawmakers are also discussing a shorter renewal to extend the program to December, said Senate staff members.\par \par \uc2 "A short-term extension will at least give us an opportunity to address the program sooner rather than doing a longer-term extension that would kick the can down the road," said Jason Tuber, senior adviser to Mr. Menendez.\par \par \uc2 More-traditional home insurers are increasingly willing to take on flood exposure instead of leaving that risk to the federal government -- thanks to improved flood models and other tools.\par \par \uc2 "We developed a comfort level in underwriting it," said Matthew Power, a senior executive at American International Group Inc., among the private-sector carriers with an alternative to the federal policies.\par \par \uc2 But the private-sector market isn't big enough to fill the gap if the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  were to let the federal program lapse. \uc2 AIG\uc2  for now has about 20,000 flood-insurance policyholders nationwide. The U.S. program, by comparison, has roughly 5 million policyholders.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170829000052"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170829ed8t0001f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 COMMENT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}\b \uc2 China's tech giants are building too much power; Opinion\b0\par\par\uc2 By Henny Sender \par \uc2 673 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 August 2017\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFTA\par \uc2 USA Ed1\par 09\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 When scientist \uc2 Wang Jun\uc2  left BGI, among the largest genomics organisations in the world, to establish iCarbonX, his latest medtech venture, in Shenzhen well over a year ago, many early local investors vied to offer him capital.\par \par \uc2 They were led by \uc2 Neil Shen\uc2  of \uc2 Sequoia Capital\uc2  China, arguably the most impressive venture investor in China . But ultimately Mr Wang decided to take money from the social media and gaming company \uc2 Tencent Holdings\uc2 . He says he decided to take Tencent's money in part because the $200m he received came with a valuation for the new company of $1bn, and in part because of the power of Tencent's \uc2 WeChat\uc2  platform, which makes every one of its 900m users a potential client or source of data .\par \par \uc2 Not long ago, "princelings" such as former president Jiang Zemin's grandson Alvin and premier \uc2 Wen Jiabao\uc2 's son Winston, and other private equity investors, were the dominant players in China's financial landscape. They had access to the best deals and garnered the highest returns. Then it was the turn of venture capital firms to accrue the big gains. But today they too are being eclipsed; nobody can compete against Tencent and its counterpart, Alibaba.\par \par \uc2 How good, though, is that duopoly for either the country or the business landscape in the long run? As the two evolve from being ecommerce and mobile app companies to massive investment firms whose capital is cheaper than anyone else's, they are able to use their monopoly positions as both carrots and sticks.\par \par \uc2 "Tencent and Ali used to be the face of innovation in China," says one venture investor who took stakes in \uc2 JD.com\uc2  and Tencent relatively early in their lives. "Now they have become an obstacle to innovation."\par \par \uc2 Even Silicon Valley doesn't have a comparable concentration. To many Chinese the situation is more akin to the market power exercised by \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  in the 1990s, and then only remotely so. The Fangs (\uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Amazon, Netflix Google) certainly dominate the tech landscape in Silicon Valley. But the culture of investing in, copying or killing your rival (or doing all three) is largely absent there.\par \par \uc2 At the heart of the market power of the two Chinese internet giants is the cheap capital they can access given their respective market caps - now about $400bn each. That clout enables them to take stakes in virtually every start-up on the mainland, even if the entrepreneur involved is reluctant to take their money and sell either (or both) a stake. Thanks to the dominance of Ali and Tencent, young firms will either be squeezed out or bought out.\par \par \uc2 Today, the two companies alternately clash and collaborate across a range of spheres including entertainment, logistics, payments, \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and increasingly healthcare.\par \par \uc2 "Three years from now," predicts one prominent venture capitalist, "90 per cent of Chinese people will use either \uc2 WePay\uc2  [now Tenpay] or Alipay, they will sign up for Tencent or Alibaba Cloud, they will get their news from either \uc2 WeChat\uc2  or Weibo [now in effect controlled by Ali] and if they need funding they will take it from Ali or Tencent."\par \par \uc2 To be sure, there is an anti-monopoly law in China but "so far it has been directed more against foreign companies when they try to buy Chinese firms than against domestic firms like these two companies," says Chen Zhiwu, a professor at Yale University's school of economics and finance. "The regulators are not doing a good job; they don't use their muscle."\par \par \uc2 In the US, there are limits to the power of even the wealthiest tech companies, partly because of the protection of intellectual property and antitrust regulations embodied in rules such as the Clayton act. There is no such tempering influence in China to constrain Alibaba and Tencent.\par \par \uc2 China's winner takes all culture is great for these two. But it is far less great for China as a whole.\par \par \uc2 henny.sender@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020170829ed8t0001l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc9}{\*\bkmkend toc9}\b \uc2 Hedge funds see a gold rush in data mining\b0\par\par\uc2 Lindsay Fortado, Robin Wigglesworth and Kara Scannell \par \uc2 2,037 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 August 2017\par 18:40\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Under Armour\uc2 , the sportswear maker brought to prominence in Oliver Stone\u8217\'20\'19s American football epic Any Given Sunday, reported its latest earnings in early August, it was an unpleasant surprise for many investors.\par \par \uc2 The company reported a second straight quarter of losses, cut its sales outlook for the rest of the year and announced a large restructuring programme that it warned would halve its operating profits in 2017. The shares tumbled almost 9 per cent on the day and have kept sagging since.\par \par \uc2 But for some hedge funds that were sold bespoke data on the company, the dismal results might not have been such a surprise. In recent years there has been a proliferation of new \u8220\'20\'1Calternative data vendors\u8221\'20\'1D that trawl through vast pools of digital information and sell it to investment groups desperate for an edge in markets.\par \par \uc2 These vendors often scoop up the digital \u8220\'20\'1Cexhaust\u8221\'20\'1D that people, companies and countries throw out through the normal course of their business and turn it into valuable intelligence.\par \par \uc2 For example, hints of \uc2 Under Armour\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s downturn could have been detected in a decline in job listings on its website, the internal rating of its chief executive by employees on Glassdoor, the recruitment site, or a dip in the average price of clothes on its website. But this is just the tip of the alternative data iceberg, and investors are waking up to the fact.\par \par \uc2 Types of alternative data: 1. Website scraping\par \par \uc2 Many data vendors scrape public websites for information that might be valuable, ranging from downloads of apps and user reviews to what airlines and hotels are receiving bookings through \uc2 Expedia\uc2  and Priceline, for instance. Social media sites can also be scraped for hints on consumer views and trends.\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn order to generate sustained [returns] investors must embrace the task of acquiring, analysing and understanding the ever-growing data universe,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  said in a recent paper. \u8220\'20\'1CThose that fail to do so run the risk of falling behind in a rapidly changing investment landscape.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Many of our online activities leave a digital fingerprint. Our mobile phones can be tracked, our emails scanned and our online purchases monitored. Companies release vast amounts of data on their websites and even local and national governments are digitising many aspects of their operations.\par \par \uc2 The vendors scrape this \u8220\'20\'1C\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 for everything from geolocation details to consumer trends and sentiment analysis \u8212\'20\'14 and turn it into tradable signals. Investment groups have often looked outside traditional information sources such as economic data releases or earnings reports. Some now think this digital treasure trove can underpin the future of the money management industry.\par \par \uc2 However, there is disquiet over the unregulated nature of the industry, which \uc2 Tabb Group\uc2  estimates will double in size in the next five years to $400m in annual sales. Some fear information that may appear public may in fact be legally protected, while others worry that hedge funds signing deals for exclusive access to certain valuable data sets will open themselves up to close scrutiny in what is a legally grey area.\par \par \uc2 2. Credit card tracking\par \par \uc2 The most valuable seam of data for hedge funds is information that shows directly what consumers are spending money on, and credit card companies are the main gold mine. Although it only offers a partial view of sales trends, combined with other data sets it can offer vital insights.\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a brave new world,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jonathan Streeter, a former federal prosecutor who led the insider trading case against \uc2 Raj Rajaratnam\uc2 , co-founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund. Mr Streeter is now a partner in New York at Dechert, a law firm with a large hedge fund client base, where he advises on what data sets are legal to purchase and use.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t know of a case that\u8217\'20\'19s been brought, but everyone anticipates that there will be one soon and [prosecutors] would like to bring one,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Streeter says. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a hot topic. I get a lot of calls from clients.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 This year, a senior executive from the family investment office of \uc2 Steve Cohen\uc2 , the billionaire whose \uc2 SAC Capital Advisors\uc2  hedge fund was shut down by federal authorities in 2013 over insider trading, was praising \u8220\'20\'1C\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D as its new edge over the market.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at a conference on alternative investments at the \uc2 London School of Economics\uc2 , Matthew Granade, Point72\u8217\'20\'19s chief market intelligence officer, bragged that they scrutinise 80m credit card transactions every day. Coupled with satellite images that can scan car parks and geolocation data from mobile phones to show how many people are visiting various stores, the investment group can get a real-time idea of how companies are doing, long before their results are released.\par \par \uc2 One \uc2 LSE\uc2  student asked how all this data could help Point72 if everyone had access to the same information. The answer was exclusivity agreements, Mr Granade said: \u8220\'20\'1CThe great thing about this area is you can arrange deals where you are the only ones who get it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 3. Geolocation\par \par \uc2 Smartphones are equipped with location services that allow us to use map or weather functions, but also let mobile carriers know where we are at any time. That data can be valuable to see what shops, hotels or restaurants we are visiting, a gold mine for hedge funds looking for clues on consumer trends.\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds have always sought an advantage, whether by taking executives out for lavish dinners to glean a sense of how their business was doing, or hiring pollsters to conduct their own surveys ahead of elections or referendums. Increased regulation and a crackdown on insider trading have reduced some of those avenues, but alternative data can offer different routes.\par \par \uc2 The biggest challenge for investors is the sheer extent of how much digital information is generated every day. There are more than 1bn websites with more than 10tn individual web pages, with 500 exabytes (or 500bn gigabytes) of data, according to \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 . And more than 100m websites are added to the internet every year.\par \par \uc2 To help navigate through the morass, an expanding range of companies offer to scrape, clean and sell this data to the investment community. They sit between the generators of information \u8212\'20\'14 such as app stores, telephone and credit card companies or social media sites \u8212\'20\'14 and the buyers of the data.\par \par \uc2 Alternative Data Insider, an information provider backed by YipitData, one of the vendors, has counted more than 100 companies in the field, with money pouring in. SpaceKnow, a satellite imaging company that looks for clues on economic activity in China and Africa, raised $4m this year, while Prattle, a sentiment analysis company that uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to turn material such as central bank speeches into tradable intelligence, raised $3.3m.\par \par \uc2 4. Satellite imagery\par \par \uc2 In previous decades an investor might send a junior trainee to a local shopping mall to count how many visitors it gets, or to local farms to check on the health of the latest barley crop. Such information gathering can now be done more comprehensively and automatically by accessing the data of satellite \u8220\'20\'1Ceyes in the sky\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAlternative data will only be alternative for so long, eventually becoming a core part of any portfolio manager\u8217\'20\'19s toolkit,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 Greenwich Associates\uc2 , a market consultancy, wrote in a recent industry report.\par \par \uc2 There is no suggestion that any hedge fund or alternative data vendor are doing anything illegal by using these new digital data sets. But lawyers urge caution, arguing that some aspects of the business, such as how providers collect the information they sell to hedge funds, and whether it is legal for funds to enter into \u8220\'20\'1Cexclusivity\u8221\'20\'1D agreements with providers, are attracting the interest of regulators and prosecutors concerned that hedge funds are getting an unfair market advantage. The laissez-faire attitude of some of their colleagues and parts of the data vendor community is also under scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds also worry that some vendors do not do a good enough job of scrubbing personally identifiable data from their troves of information. Many therefore have dedicated internal teams that clean the data before it is involved in the investment process. Indeed, some hedge fund managers say they would welcome federal regulators such as the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  taking a closer look at alternative data.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s like the Wild West and ultimately it will come under the purview of the regulators,\u8221\'20\'1D says one fund manager, who says legal opinions on the subject vary. \u8220\'20\'1CI have yet to see a clean legal opinion on all this. And we\u8217\'20\'19ve looked for one.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds have good reason to be wary. After a series of arrests from 2010, the industry was upended when dozens of traders, portfolio managers and analysts were prosecuted for using information they gleaned from so-called \u8220\'20\'1Cexpert-network\u8221\'20\'1D companies which, like data vendors, tried to match investors with information.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street traders used company insiders, doctors and others to expand their knowledge of industry trends or companies. The authorities cracked down when traders got their hands on confidential information, such as unpublished drug trial results.\par \par \uc2 To break insider trading rules an individual needs to act on \u8220\'20\'1Cmaterial, non-public information\u8221\'20\'1D received in violation of a duty to keep it confidential. While lawyers say the data sets sold must be material by definition because an investor is willing to pay for them, the vendors typically have permission to sell the aggregate data once a user clicks the box agreeing to terms and conditions. But with few legal precedents and different standards between countries or even states in the US there is little clarity.\par \par \uc2 Mr Streeter of Dechert believes it will probably be a high bar for prosecutors to bring insider trading charges against funds that have used data not deemed to be public. For instance, mobile geolocation data, which can show how many people visit \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , \uc2 Sears\uc2  or Ralph Lauren over a given period, could well be viewed as material information, and if 50 hedge funds pay say $100,000 for exclusive use of the data, it would be hard to argue that it is public. The crux is whether the owners of the information, such as \uc2 AT&T\uc2  or \uc2 Verizon\uc2 , have received consent from their customers to sell it on to third parties, he says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou look in the small print and there\u8217\'20\'19s probably somewhere in there that says \uc2 Verizon\uc2  can sell that data. \uc2 Verizon\uc2  would then sign an agreement with a data provider. So under US law [there would be] no breach of duty, no insider trading,\u8221\'20\'1D the former prosecutor says.\par \par \uc2 Many more vendors scrape information from websites, and even if it is in the public domain lawyers say they may not always have the legal right to sell it on to third parties.\par \par \uc2 Rado Lipus, head of Neudata, which vets data sets on behalf of investment groups, says \u8220\'20\'1Cexclusive data sets are a double-edged sword\u8221\'20\'1D. While they can be profitable, they are clearly not public data and some investors \u8212\'20\'14 especially bigger ones \u8212\'20\'14 prefer to avoid them to avert even a whiff of controversy. Several large hedge funds such as \uc2 Man Group\uc2  and \uc2 AQR Capital Management\uc2  go further, saying exclusive data sets are not worth the expense or legal risk.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers say they are advising clients against using some data sets, given the legal and reputational damage even the slightest sense of impropriety could cause. But experts believe the greatest risk of prosecution comes from the New York attorney-general, Eric Schneiderman, who is tackling financial fraud under the Martin Act and could stop hedge funds from using exclusive data. He has intervened before. In 2013, under pressure from Mr Schneiderman, Reuters stopped providing some exclusive content to its premium subscribers.\par \par \uc2 Sandy Rattray, chief investment officer of Man Group, says he has at least two people a week offering him exclusive data, but that it is too expensive and in any case they would analyse it differently than other funds. \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a gold rush in data mining,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CMost people that went off to prospect for gold came back penniless, but that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t mean there wasn\u8217\'20\'19t any gold.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170828ed8s005sd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The National Flood Insurance Program could be inundated with claims totaling billions of dollars following Hurricane Harvey. A U.S. News article Monday about the flood insurer incorrectly said the program could receive billions of new claims.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ August 30, 2017)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 Hurricane Harvey poses new hazards to a giant U.S. flood insurer already facing mounting debt and a reauthorization fight in Congress.\par \par \uc2 The National Flood Insurance Program, created about 50 years ago because private insurers were unwilling to risk catastrophic flood losses, could be inundated with billions of new claims following Harvey's initial Category 4 winds and colossal rainfall.\par \par \uc2 Yet the U.S. program is scheduled to expire on Sept. 30 and has just $5.8 billion left it can borrow from the Treasury to meet new claims, according to January figures reported to Congress. Many people buy the government policies through private-sector insurers, which are compensated for that service.\par \par \uc2 Members of Congress are discussing a number of options, ranging from a temporary renewal of the program to a more-comprehensive fix designed to return the program to solvency. Congress returns from recess on Sept. 5.\par \par \uc2 "From a public-policy perspective, Hurricane Harvey reinforces the narrative of why the national flood-insurance program is so important and needs to be addressed," said Christopher Gillott, legislative director for \uc2 Sen. Bill Cassidy\uc2  (R., La.).\par \par \uc2 What makes the debate in Washington so challenging is that the program already has a debt of roughly $25 billion from earlier weather disasters. Much of that is from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and superstorm Sandy in 2012. Sandy alone cost $8.4 billion initially, according to the \uc2 Federal Emergency Management Agency\uc2 , which manages the program.\par \par \uc2 The program had to borrow another $1.6 billion from the Treasury in January just to pay interest on its debt and storm claims, according to FEMA.\par \par \uc2 It will take days, if not weeks or longer, for claims to emerge from Hurricane Harvey. More than 200,000 homes along the Texas coast could be at risk, according to information and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Core-Logic. In 30 Texas counties labeled disaster areas by the state's governor there are nearly 450,000 NFIP policies covering $125.7 billion in insured value, according to the program's website. More than half that value is in heavily populated Harris County, which includes Houston.\par \par \uc2 Previous interruptions of the flood-insurance program have triggered delays in thousands of home sales during the lapses.\par \par \uc2 Sticking points in Congress include whether lawmakers will address the federal program's finances in part by increasing rates gradually for homeowners who currently pay well below the actuarial risk of flooding.\par \par \uc2 Program critics have said many policyholders are getting bargain rates compared with what private-sector insurers would require and that taxpayers in drier parts of the country are subsidizing those in flood-prone states.\par \par \uc2 Roughly a dozen senators are proposing legislation that would adjust homeowners' rates to be more in line with a property's risk, and create incentives for private insurers to take on more policies. But that package, led by \uc2 Sen. Bob Menendez\uc2  (D., N.J.), is unlikely to pass next month since Congress would have only a few weeks to address it, according to Senate staff members.\par \par \uc2 More-traditional home insurers are increasingly willing to take on flood exposure instead of leaving that risk to the federal government -- thanks to improved flood models and other tools.\par \par \uc2 "We developed a comfort level in underwriting it," said Matthew Power, a senior executive at American International Group Inc., among the private-sector carriers with an alternative to the federal policies.\par \par \uc2 But the private-sector market isn't big enough to fill the gap if the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  were to let the federal insurance program lapse. \uc2 AIG\uc2  for now has about 20,000 flood-insurance policyholders nationwide. The U.S. program, by comparison, has roughly 5 million policyholders.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Nicole Friedman contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170828000062"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170828ed8s0001i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

There are "very high levels of housing density where some of the most severe flooding is taking place. Because of that you have very high expected property and vehicle damage."\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the storm could impact the economy nationwide due to the large oil refining presence in the Gulf Coast. Refiners in Corpus Christi, Lake Charles and Houston have about 30% of the nation's oil refining capacity.\par \par \uc2 About 2 million barrels a day of refining capacity\u8212\'20\'14about 10% of the nation's overall refining capacity\u8212\'20\'14is now offline, according to \uc2 Moody's\uc2 . How soon refiners reopen will depend on whether the plants and the ports sustain major damage from the flood. But refiners outside the region may be able to step up production to offset some of the effects.\par \par \uc2 Gasoline futures rose 7 cents to $1.74 a gallon on the \uc2 New York Mercantile Exchange\uc2  on Monday. That rise hurts consumer purchasing power, butis likely to be temporary.\par \par \uc2 Gasoline prices have typically peaked within two weeks of major storms, rising by 20 to 80 cents a gallon, said Rick Joswick, managing director of global oil for PIRA Energy, an \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  unit of S&P Global Platts. Prices typically return to their pre-storm levels, or somewhat lower, with two to four weeks.\par \par \uc2 The "outlook is for gasoline prices to spike by a similar degree for the next week or so," Mr. Joswick said.\par \par \uc2 The biggest hit from any storm is to insurers and property owners. \uc2 Moody's\uc2  preliminary estimate is that the storm will cause between $30 billion and $40 billion of property damage. Mr. Kamins cautions these are initial estimates and could change significantly depending on how the storm evolves.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, the \uc2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\uc2  estimates that Hurricane Ike, which hit Texas and Louisiana in 2008, caused about $29 billion of damage, while Hurricane Rita in 2005 cost about $12 billion. If the \uc2 Moody's\uc2  estimate proves correct, it would be considerably less damage than 2005's Hurricane Katrina which caused over $100 billion in damage. Superstorm Sandy of 2012 is estimated to have caused $71 billion in damage.\par \par \uc2 Most of Hurricane Harvey's economic impact will be concentrated. The Houston area is the nation's fourth largest metropolitan economy, with about 3.1 million workers who generate over $500 billion of economic activity a year.\par \par \uc2 It remains unclear how long Houstonians and other Texans will be dealing with closed stores or idled and unreachable workplaces, but \uc2 Moody's\uc2  estimates thus far that there will be $6 billion to $8 billion in lost output in the weeks ahead. That is barely perceptible in a U.S. economy that produces more than $19 trillion worth of goods and services annually.\par \par \uc2 Even the largest storms have typically not permanently damaged the U.S. economy. This is in part because storm often spark construction booms that employ tens of thousands of people to clean up and rebuild.\par \par \uc2 Gross domestic product, the main yardstick of economic growth, doesn't account for property damage but it does account for rebuilding, so the measure can climb after storms due to activity involved in rebuilding.\par \par \uc2 Other economic measures could be skewed in the weeks ahead. The initial weeks after similarly large storms have sometimes produced rising claims by waylaid workers for unemployment insurance. After Hurricane Katrina, for example, jobless claims climbed by over 100,000 per week, although the high-level of claims didn't persist.\par \par \uc2 Michael Feroli and Daniel Silver, economists at \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., said in a note that other signs of the storm's impact could be seen in industrial production data, which will show the effect of power outages on utilities, and in personal spending data.\par \par \uc2 For hourly workers, the loss of income can be significant. According to Labor Department data, Texas counties that were declared disaster areas employ nearly four million people with about $58 billion in quarterly wages\u8212\'20\'14or about $4.5 billion per week.\par \par \uc2 While some workplaces can simply do catch-up work after the storm, others like restaurants or factories won't be able to replace much of the lost output for however long the storm leaves them closed.\par \par \uc2 Write to Josh Zumbrun at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170828ed8s005h9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The exchange-traded fund, which invests in gasoline futures, saw almost 500,000 shares change hands as of this afternoon as gasoline prices surged. Nearly 15% of US refinery capacity had been disrupted by the storm as of this morning, raising the potential for fuel shortages. Gasoline futures for September delivery gained 4.57 cents per gallon, or 2.74%, to $1.7123. The gasoline ETF up 2.5% to $27.50 per share.

Morgan\uc2 's Michael Feroli says in a note that Hurricane Harvey is likely to have the effect such storms often bring: Economic pain on the front end as the damage is taken, with added growth in the recovery stage. His firm estimates economic damage of $10 billion to $20 billion, which would be much less than Hurricane Katrina. "We believe the overall impact on GDP in Q3 and Q4 will be quite small, consistent with the historical experience. For this reason, we are not changing our top-line GDP forecast," Feroli writes. (michael.derby@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Harvey's Wind, Storm Surge Causing $1.2B to $2.3B in Damage\par \par \uc2 Hurricane Harvey's winds and storm surge will likely cause $1.2 billion to $2.3 billion in insured losses, says catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide, owned by \uc2 Verisk \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  (VRSK). Most of that damage hit Rockport, Texas, and surrounding towns. The estimate does not include the cost of damage from torrential rain and flooding that has devastated Houston. Another 10-20 inches of rain are expected by Friday, AIR says. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  Donates $1M to Support Hurricane Harvey Relief\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  (WFC) says it's donating $1 million to support Hurricane Harvey relief, with about $500K going to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund and another $500K to local nonprofits focused on recovery and relief efforts. "With forecasts calling for more rain and potentially more flooding, we will continue to work with nonprofits and those focused on relief efforts," David Miree, lead region bank president, says. WFC says customers can donate to the \uc2 American Red Cross\uc2 's hurricane relief effort at its ATMs across the country starting Tuesday. Customers won't be charged a fee to use the service and 100% of the donations will be sent to the \uc2 American Red Cross\uc2 . The bank also says certain rewards customers can redeem rewards and donate to the \uc2 American Red Cross\uc2  through Sept. 12. WFC is waiving ATM fees for customers in affected areas and will reverse other fees, such as late fees, for all its consumer products, including credit cards and checking accounts. (emily.glazer@wsj.com; @EmilyGlazerWSJ)\par \par \uc2 Property Insurance Stocks Fall on Harvey\par \par \uc2 Shares of property insurance companies are falling following Hurricane Harvey. Travelers (TRV) is down 2.8%, the biggest decliner in the Dow industrials. Other big movers are \uc2 Axis Capital Holdings\uc2  (AXS), down 2.8%, \uc2 Aspen Insurance Holdings\uc2  (AHL), down 2.7%, and \uc2 XL Group\uc2  (XL), off 2.7%. All three are Bermuda-based companies that sell specialty insurance and reinsurance, sectors that are expected to see relatively larger payouts than other parts of the industry. Another decliner was car insurer Progressive (PGR), off 2.5%. PGR has about 9% of the auto insurance market in Texas, according to data provider SNL Financial. (erik.holm@wsj.com; @erikholmwsj)\par \par \uc2 Last-Resort Texas Insurer Could Be Tested\par \par \uc2 All eyes are on the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association, the insurer of last resort for windstorm and hail insurance on the Texas coast. TWIA offers coverage to residential and commercial properties in certain regions where private insurance is deemed unavailable. The association's payment capacity for this year is $4.9 billion, and it has the option to charge policyholders more if claims exceed its payment capacity, \uc2 Moody's\uc2  says. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)\par \par \uc2 Harvey Hits Home For Houston Oil Community\par \par \uc2 Hurricane Harvey didn't just hit oil infrastructure, it also hit oil people, as Houston and surrounding areas is home to hundreds of thousands of oil professionals, oilfield workers, brokers, analysts and more. Firms like Houston-based energy investment bank and research firm Tudor Pickering Holt find themselves analyzing the financial side of the story to find winners and losers, while also pitching in on relief and recovery. "TPH paired trade: Long helping our Houston area neighbors, Short Hurricane Harvey," it says. "TPH will donate half of this week's trading commissions to Harvey relief and recovery efforts in the Houston area." (dan.molinski@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Tens of Thousands of Harvey Insurance Claims Expected\par \par \uc2 Homeowners could file up to 50,000 claims with private insurers for wind damage following Hurricane Harvey and more than 100,000 claims for flood coverage from the National Flood Insurance Program, the \uc2 Consumer Federation of America\uc2  says. The CFA estimates that insured losses from wind damage could reach $2 billion, and flood claims could reach more than $5 billion. Total flood damage could be similar to Hurricane Katrina, the CFA says, but the insurance payouts will be lower than the 2005 storm because many Houston homes don't have flood insurance. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)\par \par \uc2 Suits Over Flood Exclusion in Homeowners' Policies Likely\par \par \uc2 Harvey's massive flooding damage is likely to prompt many efforts by plaintiffs' lawyers to find ways to pierce through the flooding exclusion that is part of standard homeowners' policies, to get payouts for hard-hit families, say industry lawyers and analysts. "I have no doubt that right now there are lawyers in Texas reading every Texas court decision addressing flood coverage to find a way around the flood exclusion," said Randy Maniloff, an insurance-industry lawyer in Philadelphia. He said the exclusion is strong, but there is "too much at stake for people not to take a run at it." (leslie.scism@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Glacial Pace of Business Lending Growth Continues\par \par \uc2 Business loans grew at 2% from a year earlier, according to the latest Federal Reserve data released on Friday. The metric is slightly up from a few weeks earlier, but remains far below the pre-election pace. Between mid-2014 and mid-2016, commercial-and-industrial loan growth often grew at a double-digit pace. The paradox is that bank stocks have gone up so much since the election, even though the key metric of loan growth has continued to slow down. Bank executives have repeatedly said that business customers are waiting for more clarity from Washington before making investments. The question is whether investors will continue to patiently wait for the supposed pent-up demand to materialize. (rachel.ensign@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 CEO of Santander Holdings Takes Over Auto-Loan Unit\par \par \uc2 Scott Powell\uc2  is succeeding \uc2 Jason Kulas\uc2  as president and CEO as \uc2 Santander Consumer USA Holdings\uc2  (SC) effective immediately, the company says. This publicly traded consumer finance unit is a part of \uc2 Santander Holdings USA\uc2 , which is a unit of Spanish lender Banco Santander, S.A. Powell is already chief executive of Santander Holdings USA, and will keep that title. The consumer-finance unit focuses on auto lending, an area that analysts are concerned will face rising defaults. Also, Santander Consumer last year said it had to restate its financial results. (Rachel.Ensign@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Postal Savings Bank Gets A+ Rating From Fitch\par \par \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  awards \uc2 Postal Savings Bank of China\uc2  (1658.HK), the country's No. 6 lender by assets, with an A+ long-term issuer default rating and with Stable Outlook, to reflect its "government-protected monopoly" and "larger policy role than other state banks." Despite lower profitability and capitalization than some peers, Postal Savings Bank can benefit from strong funding and liquidity provided by its extensive retail network. With 1H17 results due out tomorrow, the stock is up 1.3% at HK$4.69 in late trading Monday, yet that's still 1.5% below its IPO price.

Revenue at publicly traded U.S. coal companies grew 19% in the first half of this year compared with the same period a year ago, and the biggest gains came at companies helped the most by exports, according to data compiled by Doyle Trading Consultants, a coal-market-analysis firm.\par \par \uc2 That growth comes at a time when President Donald Trump has vowed to end a long decline in the U.S. coal business. Hundreds of mines have closed in recent years largely because of increasing competition from other fuels, and the Trump administration has pushed to cut regulations that make coal even less competitive.\par \par \uc2 But market forces, especially China, have a much bigger influence than anything the Trump administration has done, analysts said. While that has worked in the administration's favor so far, it could also overwhelm its deregulation efforts and put the coal industry into retreat if those factors swing back the other way.\par \par \uc2 "China is 100% the key determinant," said Mark Levin, analyst at Seaport Global Securities LLC. "That's difficult for anyone in the United States to get a clear angle on."\par \par \uc2 China set the rebound in motion a year ago as global prices and U.S. exports were bottoming out. In the middle of a world-wide glut, China used new environmental rules to limit the number of days its domestic mines could work. And new price controls that increased intervention as prices moved outside a "green" zone of $70 to $80 a ton also curtailed production. Sharp capacity cuts hit as industrial demand took off and global benchmark prices are up 50% to 100% from about a year ago.\par \par \uc2 As China imported more, it shifted trade and prices rose world-wide. Russian, African and South American coal that once went to Europe has been going to China, analysts said. Importers all over the world have to pay more to fill the gap left behind.\par \par \uc2 The chain reaction led to more U.S. exports going to every continent. U.S. exports to Europe hit 11 million tons in the first quarter, up 70% from the first quarter in 2016. Exports to Asia rose by about half to 6.4 million short tons, \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  data show.\par \par \uc2 A year ago \uc2 Cloud Peak Energy Inc\uc2 . was selling so little coal abroad that it had to take losses on its contracts with shippers and pay them for doing nothing in lieu of taking coal. Now the company is back to being one of the largest exporters in the western U.S., raising exports from almost nothing a year ago to an expected 4.5 million tons in 2017. That grew its revenue nearly 20% in the first half of the year even while domestic sales have fallen.\par \par \uc2 "We've had a good and stable year, which in our environment is a good year," said Heath Hill, the company's finance chief.\par \par \uc2 Industry leaders say that good fortune has been backed up by a change of sentiment led by Mr. Trump. Business would have been worse and future prospects would be lower under a Democratic administration that used new rules to move consumers further away from coal, they said.\par \par \uc2 But the rebound has been so dependent on exports that U.S. producers face a big risk if China undoes last year's policy changes. Chinese coal production is showing signs of picking up again and the government is starting to block some imports to support domestic miners, researchers at Italian ship broker Banchero Costa said Wednesday. With U.S. year-to-date production up 14% from last year, the specter of oversupply is rising again, analysts said.\par \par \uc2 "When you're at the whim of Chinese policy makers, it's not really a great place to be," said Andy Blumenfeld, head of market \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at Doyle. "Beyond the first quarter of next year, it becomes very risky."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's team has made moves primarily to boost the domestic market. It has taken the first steps to try to roll back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan that required utilities to reduce power plant carbon-dioxide emissions. The Trump administration also wants to streamline environmental permitting.\par \par \uc2 The goal is to signal to the market that coal won't be unfairly taxed by regulation, not to prop up coal compared with other fuels, according to an administration official. It has also been pushing other polices to keep feeding a drilling boom that has already made natural gas cheaper and gas-burning plants more competitive against coal.\par \par \uc2 The Commerce Department did help get a new supply agreement for a U.S. company to ship coal to Ukraine. Pennsylvania-based coal marketing company Xcoal Energy & Resources this month started shipments of 700,000 tons of coal to Ukrainian power plants ahead of the winter. That is to help Ukraine diversify its supply and lessen its dependence on Russian fuels.\par \par \uc2 But that deal is on pace to amount to less than 1% of total U.S. exports this year. And Ukraine is a small buyer, making more deals of this type hard to replicate and hard to substantially improve the whole U.S. industry, Mr. Blumenfeld said. There was also intense competition to even get the deal.\par \par \uc2 "It is a price driven market, and if we weren't able to compete into Ukraine, we wouldn't have won the business," said Ted O'Brien, vice president, capital markets at Xcoal.\par \par \uc2 Miners really need markets to grow now, said \uc2 Luke Popovich\uc2 , spokesman at the \uc2 National Mining Association\uc2 . There may not be much more Mr. Trump can do.\par \par \uc2 "The federal government has picked the low-hanging fruit," Mr. Popovich said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Timothy Puko at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:tim.puko@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tim.puko@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-trump-move-utilities-shift-from-coal-is-set-to-continue-1490693406"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Despite Trump Move on Climate Change, Utilities' Shift From Coal Is Set to Continue}}}\uc2  (March 28)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-softens-coal-focus-in-bid-to-clean-up-its-skies-1488710457"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 China Softens Coal Focus in Bid to Clean Up Its Skies}}}\uc2  (March 5)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/coal-exports-have-become-important-to-u-s-mining-firms-amid-environmental-curb-1395273118"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The New Future for American Coal: Export It}}}\uc2  (March 20, 2014)\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROBK20170828ed8r0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Subordinates would have to remove smoke detectors from the ceilings. In those heady days before the financial crisis, Mr Misra, as head of fixed income, recruited traders such as Greg Lippmann, later played by Ryan Gosling in The Big Short . They made gigantic bets. Losses of $100m piled up in one book in 2006, enough for those responsible to be fired at any other institution, but they were kept around and made much bigger profits.\par \par \uc2 Today Mr Misra, 55, is leading a very different enterprise with a similar disregard for the norms. The SoftBank Vision Fund is a $100bn colossus fuelled by sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and corporations such as Apple and \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 . They are all backing \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , the visionary head of SoftBank, the Japanese tech and telecoms group, and by extension Mr Misra.\par \par \uc2 The fund only closed in May (and is still negotiating its final $7bn of investment) but the sceptics are already emerging. \uc2 Howard Marks\uc2 , co-chairman of Oaktree Capital, wrote recently: "The willingness of investors to invest in a shockingly large fund for levered tech investing with a questionable structure is a further indication of an exuberant, unquestioning market."\par \par \uc2 Certainly, the fund's target list seems rather amorphous. Last October, Mr Son said he would use the fund on "one or two [deals of] big size and then several $2-$5bn company acquisitions and then a bunch of $1bn". \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  itself had already agreed to acquire Arm, the UK chip designer, for \u163\'00\'A324.3bn . With Mr Son's belief in the coming "singularity", where \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will reach such sophistication that a new era of civilisation will begin, it seemed reasonable to expect that he would prioritise big buyouts in other cutting-edge companies.\par \par \uc2 And yet: WeWork. Last Thursday SoftBank announced a $4.4bn investment in one of the more dubiously valued "unicorns". The provider of achingly cool shared office space is hardly cut from the same cloth as Arm. And: \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 . The chip company is certainly high-tech but it is extravagantly valued at almost 50 times earnings and, rather than a takeover, SoftBank has acquired only 4.9 per cent. In fact, a full-scale buyout is inconceivable given \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's market capitalisation of almost $100bn.\par \par \uc2 Even this beast of a fund is not big enough to devour its natural prey.\par \par \uc2 Mr Marks also suggests that the outside investors are getting a raw deal with preferred shares that have no upside and insufficient protection if we are in a bubble. Finally, there is Mr Misra himself. Nobody doubts his financial engineering skills but some question what qualifies him to invest in tech.\par \par \uc2 The most compelling one-word response is: Alibaba. Mr Son, who is heavily involved in the Vision Fund, invested $20m in the Chinese ecommerce company, which became $65bn after Alibaba's 2014 US initial public offering. That trick only has to be repeated once for the project to pay off.\par \par \uc2 Though even if $100bn is insufficient to buy the biggest tech targets, it allows for individual equity investments of up to $10bn, outgunning even the biggest tech-focused funds such as Silver Lake.\par \par \uc2 The Vision Fund is now trying to write such a cheque for Uber. If it succeeds at buying secondary shares at a targeted valuation of about $45bn - compared with a previous valuation of $70bn - it would be a real coup: \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  would then own stakes in most of the world's big ride-hailing groups, which could end their global price war (though it raises the spectre of antitrust problems).\par \par \uc2 Although investment bankers in Silicon Valley are continually pitching buyouts to SoftBank's expanding team, large minority stakes are the emerging model. This sort of Japanese-style keiretsu , with stakes in complementary companies that can work together, might be the way the Vision Fund succeeds. For its part, WeWork is a risk but has interesting joint ventures in Japan and China. \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  has already made money: the shares were acquired for about $100, according to one person familiar with the matter. Today, they are at about $170: the fund is sitting on paper profits of almost $2bn from that one trade.\par \par \uc2 The fund's preferred shares have a 7 per cent dividend, which is not miserly. They are not immune from risk but losses would have to first burn through SoftBank's entire $28bn position. And the outsiders also get some common equity to provide upside potential.\par \par \uc2 As for Mr Misra's suitability, before his career in banking he did a masters degree in computer science. And to the relief of colleagues, even his cigars are now electronic.\par \par \uc2 tom.braithwaite@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170826ed8q0002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

This followed the announcement that Chris Gillespie had been appointed managing director of the doorstep lending unit, where debt collections collapsed after a botched reorganisation.\par \par \uc2 Mr Gillespie, who replaces Andy Parkinson with immediate effect, will focus on "re-establishing relationships with customers, bringing collections back to a normal level, and stabilising the operation of the business", Provident said. He ran the doorstep business until leaving the company in 2013 to pursue other interests.\par \par \uc2 Provident was promoted to the FTSE 100 in late 2015 and as recently as June was trading at more than \u163\'00\'A330 per share.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday the shares fell as low as \u163\'00\'A34.50 after the company warned that its consumer credit arm, which includes doorstep lending, would report losses of between \u163\'00\'A380m and \u163\'00\'A3120m in 2017. In June it said the division was heading for a profit of \u163\'00\'A360m. The reorganisation, announced in February, centred on plans to lose 4,500 self-employed debt collection agents and create 2,500 new jobs as "customer experience managers" on the company payroll.\par \par \uc2 However, in a first profit warning in June it said the existing agents, paid on commission based on what they collect, had quit at a faster pace than expected, so debt collection rates were far lower.\par \par \uc2 This week Provident said attempts to restore collection rates to acceptable levels were too weak and the business was falling "a long way short" of embedding the new operating model.\par \par \uc2 It said collections were running at 57 per cent of outstanding loans against 90 per cent in 2016 and weekly sales were \u163\'00\'A39m down on the same period in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Peter Crook\uc2 , chief executive and architect of the mishandled reorganisation, resigned on Tuesday with his responsibilities assumed by \uc2 Manjit Wolstenholme\uc2  as executive chairman.\par \par \uc2 The interim dividend, which had already been declared, was cancelled and management said it was "unlikely" it would pay a full-year dividend\par \par \uc2 Ms Wolstenholme said yesterday her review of the business was "ongoing", indicating that the latest appointments may not be the only management changes.\par \par \uc2 Provident's consumer credit division also includes Satsuma, an online instalment loan business. Luke Enock, who runs Satsuma as well as providing \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  for the consumer credit division, will become deputy managing director of the doorstep business. Greg Cant, group director of corporate finance, will provide the division with "further project management expertise", the company said.\par \par \uc2 Neil Woodford\uc2  , the fund manager who owns about 19 per cent of the company, said he was "disappointed" at Provident's performance but expressed confidence "it will ultimately get back on track".\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170826ed8q0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

After the company's filing was reported by WSJ Pro Venture Capital, Mr. Musk tweeted, "Neuralink is not raising money." He didn't elaborate further, and a spokesperson for Neuralink said via email the company isn't commenting on the filing "at this time."\par \par \uc2 The "natural lace" technology, as Mr. Musk has previously described it, consists of tiny implantable brain electrodes that may eventually be able to upload and download thoughts. To achieve that, Mr. Musk has proposed developing cranial computers that could possibly employ a form of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  called "direct cortical interface," allowing the human brain to function at a higher level.\par \par \uc2 Max Hodak, the founder of robotics-lab startup \uc2 Transcriptic\uc2  who confirmed he is a member of Neuralink's founding team, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's filing lists 12 investors so far in the company.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Rolfe Winkler contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Mack at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:heather.mack@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 heather.mack@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170825ed8p0050m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Beneficiaries of Vision Fund's capital include San Francisco-based Plenty United LLC, an indoor-farming startup that raised $200 million, and Jacksonville, Fla., online sports retail company \uc2 Fanatics Inc\uc2 ., which this month {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/web-retailer-fanatics-raises-1-billion-from-softbanks-vision-fund-1502219551"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 raised $1 billion}}}\uc2 . Other investments include the acquisition of \uc2 Google\uc2 's robotics division \uc2 Boston Dynamics\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  company \uc2 Brain Corp\uc2 ., in which the fund led a $114 million investment.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  also recently proposed an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-boosts-bet-on-ride-hailing-with-play-for-stake-in-uber-1501006584"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 investment of at least $1 billion in Uber }}}\uc2 that the ride-hailing company's board is weighing, people familiar with the matter have said.\par \par \uc2 "From our perspective, the world is changing," Mr. Son said earlier this month at a SoftBank investor event. "With the evolution of IT, the evolution of the internet and the evolution of the smartphone, people's lifestyles are changing."\par \par \uc2 Even before the Vision Fund, Mr. Son had already turned SoftBank into one of Japan's biggest companies by making sizable investments in telecommunications, e-commerce and technology, including an early investment in Chinese internet company \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 ., a gamble on U.S. telecommunications company \uc2 Sprint Corp\uc2 . and a buyout of U.K. microchip designer ARM Holdings PLC.\par \par \uc2 WeWork, which essentially operates in the staid office-leasing business, isn't an obvious fit for a tech fund. The company leases space from landlords, carves it up into small glassy offices and rents them out to larger companies for an average of around $650 a month. While it initially billed itself as largely for startups and small companies that could do deals and business with each other, it has been {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-to-big-companies-work-with-us-1471303282"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 expanding its reach into larger companies}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14including tech giants such as \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 IBM Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, many executives and analysts within the real-estate industry, as well as the tech sector, have been perplexed by WeWork's valuation, which is extremely high by real estate standards. \uc2 IWG PLC\uc2 , the parent of \uc2 Regus\uc2 , has a similar business model, although less cultural appeal and brand recognition with young workers. Its market capitalization equates to about $10,000 per desk. WeWork's valuation equals about $160,000 per desk.\par \par \uc2 But many of its investors view WeWork as a bet on the larger tech and startup economy: As it grows, so should WeWork.\par \par \uc2 WeWork has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-the-communal-office-startup-raises-new-financing-1457558625"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 grown rapidly}}}\uc2  in recent years. Led by a voluble, long-haired chief executive, Adam Neumann, WeWork has expanded from a single small building in Manhattan to more than 160 locations in 16 countries, with nearly $1 billion in annualized revenue and more than 125,000 desks. It has been doubling each year recently, and has no plans of slowing. Legions of architects and engineers on staff pump out designs for new locations.\par \par \uc2 The company gained the eye of Silicon Valley early on, winning backing in 2012 from the well-regarded venture capital investor Benchmark, which also made early bets on \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 . and Uber.\par \par \uc2 Through late last year, the company {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-raises-260-million-capping-off-690-million-funding-round-1476284233"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 had raised $1.7 billion}}}\uc2  and was viewed as a likely candidate for an initial public offering sometime in 2017.\par \par \uc2 But then it began talking with SoftBank, which had considered\u8212\'20\'14and passed on\u8212\'20\'14investing twice previously. \uc2 SoftBank{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-mulls-investment-of-over-1-billion-in-wework-1485814702"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reversed course}}}\uc2  when Mr. Son began raising money for the Vision Fund last year, which would allow for a far larger investment.\par \par \uc2 Over ensuing months, the two companies struck a complex set of deals. In numerous markets in Asia, SoftBank and WeWork are setting up separate subsidiaries in which SoftBank shares control and ownership, as part of a plan to rapidly expand in Japan, China and other markets. About $1.4 billion is dedicated to those new companies.\par \par \uc2 About $1.3 billion is going toward buying out existing shareholders, according to a person familiar with the matter. About $1 billion of the remainder was invested in WeWork in recent months.\par \par \uc2 Yoree Koh contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Eliot Brown at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:eliot.brown@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 eliot.brown@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 READ MORE\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-long-painful-birth-of-the-worlds-biggest-tech-fund-1495214782"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How SoftBank and Saudi Arabia Settled Their Differences to Birth the World's Biggest Tech Fund}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://graphics.wsj.com/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Startup Stock Tracker}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-and-other-firms-test-brooklyns-office-market-1503287631"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WeWork and Other Firms Test Brooklyn's Office Market}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170824ed8o0053d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Andreessen Horowitz was the lead investor on the initial $65 million round, announced in March. GV, which Mr. Maris headed until August 2016, participated in the Series A.\par \par \uc2 Anne Wojcicki\uc2 , chief executive of genetic-profile startup \uc2 23andMe\uc2 , also participated in the extension, along with some undisclosed investors. \uc2 Freenome\uc2 , which has raised $78 million to date, is among Section 32's few publicly disclosed investments since Mr. Maris launched the fund earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 The startup screens for cancer using a combination of blood analysis, gene sequencing and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Traditional cancer screening tests look at specific biomarkers in blood or tissues that indicate disease is already present.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Freenome\uc2  uses signals from cell-free DNA floating in blood to allow for earlier detection. The challenge is first defining as many signals as possible.\par \par \uc2 To do that, \uc2 Freenome\uc2  works with research institutions like the University of San Francisco and Massachusetts General Hospital to study a large, diverse set of DNA samples.\par \par \uc2 "We're looking at all the cell types and all the changes that occur at different points in time as a person is developing cancer, and by analyzing as many samples as possible, we can begin to learn the best signatures from different cancer types," said Freenome co-founder and Chief Operating Officer \uc2 Riley Ennis\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The technology includes Illumina's gene-sequencing tools and \uc2 Freenome\uc2 's \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  software, trained from the company's expanding pool of samples.\par \par \uc2 The 40-employee company operates out of Verily, the life-sciences labs created by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . \uc2 Vijay Pande\uc2 , an \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  general partner, is listed as a board member.\par \par \uc2 Among other venture-backed cancer-detection startups, Grail Inc.closed a Series B {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/diverse-syndicate-powers-grails-cancer-testing-ambitions-1488503338"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 round }}}\uc2 of more than $900 million earlier this year.

In a week the daily rate for a medium-range tanker in the Atlantic can double or halve.\par \par \uc2 Maersk will use the data to predict demand and improve the deployment of its 160-strong fleet, while taking advantage of price trends.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very volatile industry," said Soren Christian Meyer, head of strategy at Maersk Tankers. "It's important to have tankers at the right place at the right time."\par \par \uc2 The industry had relied on "gut feeling" for its deployment of capacity, he added. "But we want to challenge that industry paradigm. Our investment in CargoMetrics will speed up our digitalisation."\par \par \uc2 Companies such as CargoMetrics crunch global shipping, satellite and even weather data to track and trade commodity flows.\par \par \uc2 About 90 per cent of global trade moves by sea, and the fund tracks the movements of more than 120,000 ships through their VHF radio transmissions and satellites.\par \par \uc2 Scott Borgerson , founder, said the investment would allow CargoMetrics to scale up in "people, data and machines".\par \par \uc2 However, the partnership would also give quants at the hedge fund greater access to Maersk's tanker information. "We are already learning a lot from them, and they from us," said Mr Borgerson.\par \par \uc2 In quantitative investing , computers sift through vast amounts of data and trades are largely executed automatically by algorithms. It is one of the hottest corners of the hedge fund world, and have attracted billions of dollars of inflows in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2  has estimated that the assets managed by quant hedge funds have doubled over the past decade to $500bn this year.\par \par \uc2 CargoMetrics has attracted backing from Mr Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, who also owns a chunk of DE Shaw, a rival quant fund; \uc2 Idan Ofer\uc2  , an Israeli shipping tycoon ; and Mr Tudor Jones, head of \uc2 Tudor Investment Corporation\uc2  and one of the pioneers of the hedge fund industry.\par \par \uc2 Although the performance of many quant funds has soured this year, interest remains strong, given the paucity of alternatives.\par \par \uc2 Many investors have said the future of managing money will involve great use of "\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 ", which must be analysed and turned into tradeable signals by computer scientists.\par \par \uc2 Two Sigma, a New York hedge fund, is among groups that are applying their data and computing expertise in other industries such as insurance.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170824ed8o0001z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The five-person San Francisco-based startup has already funded and seen profits from a few cases.\par \par \uc2 "We came into the industry and realized that everybody was using old-school methods of analyzing cases," said its co-founder and Chief Executive Eva Shang. By contrast, she said, Legalist's algorithms almost entirely remove the need for lawyers to review cases by hand to find winners. Legalist has one lawyer on staff.\par \par \uc2 "Our hope is to scale out to $100 million or $1 billion funds and have to barely grow our team," Ms. Shang said.\par \par \uc2 Legalist's algorithms weigh the judge and court's reputation for being plaintiff-friendly or defense-friendly, and other factors the startup identified interviewing hundreds of plaintiffs' lawyers. Legalist monitors federal cases and state cases in major metropolitan areas, and reaches out to plaintiffs that catch its eye.\par \par \uc2 Major litigation funding firms focus on big-ticket cases, and often won't make investments below a certain threshold, like $1 million, according to Ms. Shang.\par \par \uc2 Legalist aims at the lower end, focusing on civil suits brought by small businesses. It will back about 100 cases out of its fund, which it plans to deploy over the next year. On average, it invests $100,000 in each case.\par \par \uc2 "We find ourselves working with a lot of small law firms, small businesses who have very meritorious cases, but for whatever reason just don't have the money to pay for it," Ms. Shang said. In a pending case, Legalist is funding an ice-cream sandwich manufacturer in Massachusetts that's suing its vendor for providing low-quality ice cream. Legalist got involved about a year into the case, after the plaintiff could no longer afford to fund it alone, Ms. Shang said.\par \par \uc2 Legalist only gets involved in suits that are already filed, both to avoid encouraging frivolous litigation and to gauge a case's progress in hitting certain milestones to better predict success, she said.\par \par \uc2 Last year the startup made its public debut, not long after revelations that \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  had bankrolled lawsuits against \uc2 Gawker Media\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Also last year Ms. Shang was a Thiel Fellow, receiving a $100,000 grant Mr. Thiel set up for founders who leave school to start a company. The fellowship doesn't give the Thiel Foundation equity, and no fund affiliated with Mr. Thiel has a stake in Legalist.\par \par \uc2 Legalist participated in \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 's program and raised a $1.5 million seed round.\par \par \uc2 For venture capitalists, litigation finance could be a new asset class, and one with a shorter time horizon. Refactor Capital invested in the new fund, as did several other venture capitalists invested as individuals, including VY Capital founder Alexander Tamas, Lookout founder John Hering, Katana Capital Founding Partner Charles Songhurst and WikiHow founder Jack Herrick.\par \par \uc2 "I think there's a trend of investors generally looking for different ways to deploy their capital" such as initial coin offerings and lenders, said David Lee, a managing partner at Refactor Capital, which invested in Legalist's seed round last year and its first fund. "I wouldn't be surprised if litigation financing becomes another category in that spirit."\par \par \uc2 Write to Patience Haggin at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:patience.haggin@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 patience.haggin@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170824ed8o0008f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Royal Bank of Canada\uc2  is paying for an accelerated push into digital and mobile banking by cutting jobs and reducing its branch banking footprint.\par \par \uc2 Canada's largest bank by revenue recorded severance costs of 120 million Canadian dollars (about US$95.6 million) during its fiscal third-quarter, as it cut head office jobs. The bank announced in June it would cut 450 positions, primarily from its Toronto head office.\par \par \uc2 The bank had planned on making the cuts over the next two years, but decided to move more quickly to help pay for higher spending on digital technology, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and cybersecurity, Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Rod Bolger\uc2  said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 "If we hadn't seen the severance, we would have an uptick to the cost base," he said.\par \par \uc2 RBC has been cutting workers and shrinking the square footage of its branches as it shifts its business to emphasize advisory services and mobile banking, he said.\par \par \uc2 The rise in severance costs helped push noninterest expense up 7% from the year before, along with higher salaries and as the company also spent more on marketing and public relations.\par \par \uc2 RBC's fiscal third-quarter profit topped expectations amid growth in its wealth-management business, even as unfavorable market conditions caused revenue to slide.\par \par \uc2 Total assets under management grew 5% from the year before, driven by growth in the wealth-management business.\par \par \uc2 RBC also announced a 5% increase in its quarterly dividend, the second time it has raised the payout by 5% this year.\par \par \uc2 The Toronto-based bank posted a quarterly profit of C$2.8 billion, or C$1.85 a share, relatively unchanged from a year before but slightly more than analysts polled by \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2  expected. Revenue, meanwhile, slipped 3% to C$9.99 billion from C$10.26 billion.\par \par \uc2 Net income from RBC's wealth-management segment jumped 25%, mainly due to larger asset balances and higher interest rates. RBC's net interest income inched up 3% while fee-based income dropped 7%.\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive \uc2 Dave McKay\uc2  said in a new release announcing the results that the bank has been investing in digital capabilities and key markets to drive growth. Still, RBC has had to contend with a slowing Canadian real-estate market and lagging auto sales.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKay said in a conference call with analysts that he supported recent moves by Canadian officials to cool housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver. He said officials may need to do more in Toronto if prices rebound after recent softness, but said he was encouraged by the "healthy moderation" he had seen in markets.\par \par \uc2 The bank had a loan-loss provision of C$2.24 billion in the quarter, up from C$2.18 billion a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 The bank raised its quarterly dividend to C$0.91 from C$0.87.\par \par \uc2 Write to Vipal Monga at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:vipal.monga@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 vipal.monga@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170823ed8n0028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The intention isn't for those with acute psychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, but for those experiencing additional mental stress because of their medical condition. For example, people with chronic conditions like diabetes who may experience depression or anxiety that impedes their ability to manage their condition or those who are recovering from a major procedure.\par \par \uc2 While not a medical-grade tool, the AbleTo platform is based on clinically validated assessments to screen for common behavioral health conditions, and it uses established cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. Based on an individual's needs, the web- and mobile-based platform designs personal self-management programs that are augmented with weekly virtual coaching sessions.\par \par \uc2 Chronic condition management is a big field in digital health, with dozens of so-called coaching and behavioral health tools available for a range of conditions. Many, like Omada Health, are geared toward prevention of diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Others work to address the general shortage of mental health services through telemedicine or take a broader approach like Happify or Joyable by offering apps for mental health and well-being.\par \par \uc2 AbleTo is a little different than all of those, and it is garnered a sizable market share, according to the company. It works with employers and large health plans across the U.S., including \uc2 Aetna\uc2  and leading statewide BlueCross BlueShield plans. \uc2 Aetna\uc2  has been working with the company for six years, and the two have published outcomes data in the American Journal of Managed Care showing a 31 percent reduction in hospitalizations over a six-month period.\par \par \uc2 "Millions of American adults have both a behavioral and medical health condition, and those types of co-morbidities are not easy problems to solve," said AbleTo President and CEO Rob Rebak. "You need technology and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to enable this type of care coordination, and you need to do it beyond little pilots."\par \par \uc2 AbleTo has raised $57.4 million in funding to date. Aetna Ventures, the investment arm of AbleTo's strategic partner, also contributed to the latest round, along with all existing investors, including .406 Ventures, BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners, \uc2 Sandbox Industries\uc2 , HLM Venture Partners and Horizon Healthcare Services. The company plans to use the funding to build out new features on the platform and make strategic partnerships.\par \par \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2  Ventures Managing Director Yumin Choi led the investment and will join AbleTo's board. He said the company's emphasis on clinical validation and outcomes drew his interest. Given AbleTo's large customer base and growing provider network, Mr. Choi sees the company as a leader in the effort to integrate physical and mental health services.\par \par \uc2 "The idea of mental wellness and stress reduction has been popular in everyday life, but the medical community is just now starting to be open to the fact that you need to address mental and behavioral health as well as the body," said Mr. Choi. "This is where the market is going."\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170823ed8n000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

That, along with the complexity of independent insurance brokers, can lead some employers to simply choose the most expensive plan under the notion that it will cover all bases.\par \par \uc2 It is that scenario San Mateo, Calif.-based Lumity, Inc. wants to help employers avoid. Backed by a new $19 million in Series B funding, the company employs \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools to inform the health benefits decision-making process.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2013, Lumity is one of several companies offering a tech-enabled approach to employee health benefits. Some, like Accolade Health or \uc2 Castlight Health Inc\uc2 ., which acquired health benefits startup Jiff Inc. in a $117.5 million stock deal in January, take a more concierge approach and work with health systems and insurance plans in addition to employers. Others take the all-in-one approach of \uc2 Zenefits\uc2  or Namely, effectively re-creating a company's separate payroll, benefits and human resources channels into one.\par \par \uc2 Lumity is a bit different in that it focuses singularly on benefits. It is the area that requires the most money and is likely to require complex, manual processes, said Lumity Chief Executive Officer Tariq Hilaly.\par \par \uc2 "It can be like doing your taxes, but without the advantage of something like Turbo Tax," said Mr. Hilaly, who experienced the difficulty of making benefits decisions at his previous company, Motif Investing. "So we developed a tool that uses your own data to guide you through the process, and we made it in a way that you can plug it into any existing HR or payroll system."\par \par \uc2 Personal health data exists in multiple places, and outliers from any one source\u8212\'20\'14like a costly hospital visit\u8212\'20\'14can skew an insurance membership pool. Lumity tries to offset that with more granular data, which it acquires through direct connections with major pharmacy-benefits managers across the country. Employees can check a box to import a seven-year history of prescriptions and the clinicians who prescribed them, enabling Lumity to use \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to steer them toward the best plan for their needs.\par \par \uc2 Pharmacy-benefits managers have drawn scrutiny as of late, as they operate as independent third parties and affect health costs in ways that aren't always transparent. But they have also been tapped by startups the likes of Lumity and pharmacy discount app maker Blink Health for their penetration in the health care system, thanks to partnerships with drugmakers and a trove of data.\par \par \uc2 So far, that data and the benefits-only strategy is working for Lumity. Initially geared toward small employers, Lumity serves those with upward of 1,700 employees, and it now has around 50 customers.\par \par \uc2 "We like Lumity's straightforward pitch: A one-arm approach, it doesn't demand much of the customer, and it is capable of ingesting data automatically," said Draper Fisher Jurveston Partner \uc2 Josh Stein\uc2 , who led the investment and will take a board position.\par \par \uc2 Lumity plans to use the latest funding to expand the pace of product development and attract larger customers. Existing investors Social + Capital and True Venture Partners also contributed. The company raised $11 million in 2015, and the latest round brings Lumity's total funding to date to about $33 million.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170823ed8n000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

If the past is any precedent, both Republican and Democratic senators on the Senate Banking Committee will use the opportunity to lambaste the bank, which would surely love to avoid another public drubbing.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  officials have already been skewered by House and Senate committees over the bank's phony-accounts scandal. Now that more problems have surfaced at the bank, the country's third-largest by assets, the Senate banking panel faces pressure to turn up the heat.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, the committee has yet to announce plans for a hearing to address the latest debacle at the bank. Regulators are probing whether \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  improperly charged thousands of people for a type of auto insurance and made premium payments without customers' authorization. The bank says it ended the program in question, changed management and is in the process of refunding $80 million to customers.\par \par \uc2 The banking panel's 11 Democrats urged its chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), in a letter earlier this month to invite \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  executives to a hearing. Because Mr. Crapo is trying to operate the committee in a bipartisan fashion, it would be difficult for him to ignore the request outright without alienating Democrats whose support he will need to advance an ambitious legislative agenda, including an overhaul of \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Spokeswomen for Mr. Crapo and \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Republican lawmakers are generally reluctant to harangue top executives in public, but a decision not to call a hearing could cause the banking panel to effectively cede its turf to other lawmakers. A bipartisan group of senators from the Commerce Committee sent a letter this month to Wells Fargo Chief Executive \uc2 Timothy Sloan\uc2  seeking more information about the auto-insurance issues. The banking committee is unlikely to give up its jurisdiction to another panel.\par \par \uc2 (For its part, the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  is conducting an "independent, comprehensive and professional" investigation into \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , the panel's chairman, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), told House Democrats this month in a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Hensarling hasn't scheduled a hearing.)\par \par \uc2 Any hearing could complicate Republicans' efforts to kill a new \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  rule barring banks from requiring customers to use arbitration to resolve disputes. The Senate Banking Committee's Democrats, who support the rule and oppose efforts to overturn it, said in their Aug. 1 letter that they would like to question \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  on its use of "forced arbitration" clauses, which prevented customers caught up in the fake-accounts scandal from suing in court for damages.\par \par \uc2 Drawing more public attention to \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 's missteps could be just the platform Democrats need to undercut the already-precarious GOP efforts to kill the CFPB rule. Nevertheless, a hearing seems increasingly likely.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 U.S. Weighs Restricting Trades in Venezuelan Debt to Punish Maduro\par \par \uc2 By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Ian Talley\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  is considering restricting trades in Venezuelan debt as it seeks to punish President Nicol\u225\'00\'E1s Maduro for undermining the country's democracy, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The unprecedented move would temporarily ban U.S.-regulated financial institutions from buying and selling dollar-denominated bonds issued by the Republic of Venezuela and state oil company \uc2 Petr\u243\'00\'F3leos de Venezuela SA\uc2 , according to a person who was briefed on the proposal.\par \par \uc2 Another person familiar with the matter cautioned that the measure was one of several steps under consideration regarding Venezuela. The person said the final decision would rest with President Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 One option being considered is banning the trading in just some papers issued by the state oil company to limit its access to external funds, said a third person.\par \par \uc2 The ban would be the first step against the Venezuelan financial system since President Trump promised "swift economic action" against Mr. Maduro for installing a parallel parliament staffed with loyalists earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 Up to now, the progressive waves of U.S. sanctions have targeted dozens of Venezuelan officials, banning them from traveling to the U.S. and freezing any assets in the country for alleged human rights abuses and corruption.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Vice President Michael Pence is scheduled to speak to Venezuelan expatriates in Miami.\par \par \uc2 The ban is designed to damage Mr. Maduro's support among military officers and government contractors who hold Venezuelan bonds, without immediately hurting the wider population, said the person briefed on the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Maduro's government has continued making bond payments despite undergoing the world's deepest recession, rewarding risk-tolerant investors with the world's highest yields. Many major U.S. fund managers rely on Venezuelan debt for growth at a time when most rich countries offer negative interest rates on their bonds.\par \par \uc2 The Venezuelan government has about $65 billion of outstanding debt, which is among the most frequently traded in the emerging markets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Maduro has prioritized international debt payments at all costs, even as the country sank deeper into an economic crisis and his government cut back on imports of food and medicine.\par \par \uc2 Venezuelan bond trading attracted public scrutiny earlier this year after the asset-management business of \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . bought $2.8 billion-worth of the country's debt at about 30 cents on the dollar.\par \par \uc2 Venezuelan opposition accused the investment bank of financing the Mr. Maduro's repression of peaceful protesters. \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  had said the bonds were bought on the secondary markets and did not add any fresh funds to the government.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 's rival \uc2 Credit Suisse Group\uc2  said it prohibited its traders from buying and selling certain Venezuelan bonds because of the risk the trades would finance human rights abuses.\par \par \uc2 The policy forbids employees from trading or using as collateral two specific bonds, one issued by the Venezuelan government due in 2036, and one by state oil \uc2 PDVSA\uc2  due in 2022, as well as bonds from government entities issued after June 1.\par \par \uc2 Think Rates Are Going Up? Banks Don't\par \par \uc2 By Rachel Louise Ensign\par \par \uc2 After years of waiting for interest rates to rise, some banks are lending as if that day will never come, loading up on a record amount of loans and securities that carry low rates for long periods.\par \par \uc2 The percentage of bank assets that won't mature or change rates for more than five years reached a new high in the second quarter, according to \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2  data released Tuesday. That means banks are allowing more borrowers to lock in low rates for long periods, a potential risk should rates move sharply higher.\par \par \uc2 "The interest-rate environment and competitive lending conditions continue to pose challenges for many institutions. Some banks have responded to this environment by 'reaching for yield' through higher-risk and longer-term assets," FDIC Chairman \uc2 Martin Gruenberg\uc2  said in remarks accompanying the data.\par \par \uc2 Banks largely make money in two ways: from lending and fees. Midsize and smaller lenders tend to rely more on lending profits than bigger banks that have fee businesses like wealth management. Lending profits typically come from the difference between what banks pay out on deposits and what they earn on loans and securities.\par \par \uc2 But rock-bottom interest rates following the financial crisis eroded those margins across the industry, leading some banks to lend for longer so they can capture more yield. Growing their volume of loans also helped them compensate.\par \par \uc2 "It's a struggle for everybody in the industry," said Denny Hudson, chief executive of Stuart, Fla.-based \uc2 Seacoast Banking Corp. of Florida\uc2 , which has $5.3 billion in assets. He said his firm tried to keep its lending in check, but added there is a downside to being too careful.\par \par \uc2 "You could be smart all day long waiting for rates to increase, and you'll get killed by investors" rooting for loan growth, Mr. Hudson said.\par \par \uc2 Regulators and bank investors typically worry about interest-rate risk because banks borrow money at low rates on a short-term basis, usually by taking deposits, and lend it out at higher rates for a longer term. That can create a mismatch if rates move sharply higher.\par \par \uc2 An added worry: much of this lending for longer is in the booming area of commercial real estate, where borrowers finance offices and apartment buildings typically with loans that have fixed-rate periods from three to 10 years.\par \par \uc2 "Every meeting I went to, bankers said, \u8216\'20\'18We're not going to go past five years" on commercial real estate, said Scott Hildenbrand, chief balance sheet strategist at \uc2 Sandler O'Neill + Partners\uc2 . Within a year or so, the bankers were saying, \u8216\'20\'18We're not going to go past 10 years."\par \par \uc2 Englewood Cliffs, N.J.-based \uc2 ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc\uc2 ., for instance, has grown quickly in recent years largely through commercial real estate lending. These loans made up more than half of the bank's assets at the end of 2016 and most of them were originated in the past three years, the bank said.\par \par \uc2 Competition for such borrowers was fierce, though it has slowed a bit in recent months after regulators raised concerns about the sector broadly, Chief Executive \uc2 Frank Sorrentino\uc2  said in an interview. While Mr. Sorrentino said his bank, which has $4.7 billion in assets, has expertise in the sector that serves it well, his firm has recently started to diversify lending.\par \par \uc2 "There's risk in everything that we do," Mr. Sorrentino said of banking. "That's what we do, take credit risk and interest-rate risk."\par \par \uc2 Across all banks, the percentage of total assets that are at a fixed rate for more than five years was 27.5% in the second quarter of 2017, its highest since the FDIC started tracking it in 1984. The metric reached 33.7% in the second quarter at banks with $1 billion to $10 billion in assets.\par \par \uc2 Commercial real-estate loans made up 31.5% of assets at those midsize and smaller banks in the quarter, up from 25.7% in the second quarter of 2012. The figure is far lower at bigger banks, at 6.4%, and has remained steady in recent years.\par \par \uc2 So far, the reach for yield hasn't proven a problem as long-term rates have remained low, despite the Federal Reserve increasing short-term rates. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury has been around 2.20% of late and hasn't touched the 3% mark since early 2014. At the same time, credit quality of loans has stayed strong.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the FDIC said in its report Tuesday that U.S. banks' earnings rose 10.7% to $48.3 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, indicating the sector is continuing its postcrisis recovery. Nearly two-thirds of banks reported their earnings were up from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 The FDIC cautioned that the pace of loan growth is waning. U.S. banks had about $9.4 trillion in net loans and leases in the second quarter. While that was up 4% from a year earlier, the rate of growth is down from a 7% pace in much of 2016.\par \par \uc2 Problem loans also continued to decline, with banks reporting a 6.7% decrease in loans that were 90 days or more past due in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 Still, regulators have warned that the growing share of longer-term and commercial-real estate loans at some banks could be risky.\par \par \uc2 By locking in longer terms for loans at lower rates, banks could face a profit squeeze if they have to raise deposit rates sharply in the future. And a heavy concentration in commercial real-estate loans could become an issue if credit issues begin to crop up.\par \par \uc2 Between 2015 and early 2017, commercial real-estate loans generally grew at a pace above a 10% annual rate at smaller lenders, according to Federal Reserve data.\par \par \uc2 "This was generally what they knew and knew well," Christopher McGratty, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said of commercial real-estate lending at smaller banks. Lending to businesses, for instance, often requires more specialized knowledge, which gives larger, more-diversified banks an advantage.\par \par \uc2 The growth rate for commercial real-estate loans, now around 9%, has helped banks compensate for a slowdown in general business lending, much of which is floating rate, meaning the interest rates on the loans rise and fall with market rates.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Rachel Witkowski contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Mnuchin's Wife Apologizes Over \uc2 Instagram\uc2  Flap\par \par \uc2 By Kate Davidson\par \par \uc2 Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2 , apologized Tuesday after a flap over photos and comments Ms. Linton posted to \uc2 Instagram\uc2  related to her travel in a government plane.\par \par \uc2 The Scottish-born actress, who wed the Treasury secretary in June, traveled with her husband Monday on a trip to Louisville, Ky., where Mr. Mnuchin appeared with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at an event meant to promote the GOP's plan to revamp the U.S. tax code.\par \par \uc2 On her \uc2 Instagram\uc2  account, Ms. Linton posted a photo of herself and her husband leaving the plane and spotlighted her designer-label wardrobe, and then railed at a commenter who criticized the post.\par \par \uc2 "I apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response. It was inappropriate and highly insensitive," Ms. Linton said in a statement from her publicist.\par \par \uc2 The photo included hashtags for Ms. Linton's outfit, such as #hermesscarf, #tomford and #valentino, along with the caption, "Great #daytrip to #Kentucky!"\par \par \uc2 A Treasury spokeswoman said Tuesday Ms. Linton pays her own way when she accompanies her husband on official business, and doesn't receive any compensation from the brands she mentioned. Ms. Linton routinely tags designer brands of various pieces of her wardrobe in her \uc2 Instagram\uc2  photos, which include shots of her walking the red carpet, flying in private helicopters, attending a White House gala and posing on her wedding day with the president, vice president and their wives.\par \par \uc2 When a commenter made a snarky remark about taxpayers footing the bill for the trip, Ms. Linton shot back, "Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self-sacrifice to your country?"\par \par \uc2 "I'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \u8216\'20\'18trip' than you did," she said, adding that the woman was "adorably out of touch."\par \par \uc2 Not long after the post, Ms. Linton deleted the photos and set her account to private. But screenshots of the post circulated on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Linton regularly accompanies her husband to official events in and outside of Washington, and joined him on his first foreign visit as secretary to Canada earlier this year. A Treasury spokeswoman said the couple has always reimbursed the government for Ms. Linton's travel on official business, but said she didn't know how many trips she has taken or how much they have reimbursed the government so far. Spouses of cabinet secretaries typically don't accompany them on government trips.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin drew criticism earlier this year when he encouraged an audience at a public interview to "send your kids to \u8216\'20\'18Lego Batman,'" the film on which he served as an executive producer.\par \par \uc2 The plug prompted a letter to the \uc2 Office of Government Ethics\uc2  from the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee asking whether the commented violated ethics rules. Mr. Mnuchin later apologized and promised to "exercise greater caution."\par \par \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  Nears Pilot Deal to Offer Installment Loans\par \par \uc2 By AnnaMaria Andriotis\par \par \uc2 Upstart financing firm Affirm Inc. is in talks to offer installment loans to \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 . customers, said people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The development is the latest sign of retailers' desire to reach new customers with limited credit histories, and of the intensifying competition facing credit-card providers such as \uc2 Synchrony Financial\uc2 , the exclusive issuer of U.S. credit cards for the world's largest retailer.\par \par \uc2 Affirm, based in San Francisco, is run by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin. Affirm and \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2 , which is based in Bentonville, Ark., are nearing an agreement on a pilot in which Affirm would offer installment loans to some \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  shoppers in the U.S. as soon as this fall, the people said.\par \par \uc2 The financing at first would be available in select locations and to certain customers online, though it could expand later if the program proves successful enough. Affirm's loans will be largely geared to costlier \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  items like tires and other purchases over $200, a person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Installment loans, which are designed to be paid off by a certain date, generally appeal to shoppers who want to spread out their payments over time. Affirm's installment loans have fixed annual percentage rates that often range from 10% to 30% depending in part on the borrower's creditworthiness.\par \par \uc2 Rates for purchases on Synchony Wal-Mart credit cards are variable and run from 17.9% to 23.9%. Affirm doesn't charge borrowers late fees, while those fees on Synchrony's \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  cards are up to $38.\par \par \uc2 Affirm's loans are often geared to people who don't have enough of a borrowing history to get a credit card. The firm's average loan is about $750, but its loan sizes generally run up to $10,000. The company has repayment periods that range three to 24 months with an average term of nine months.\par \par \uc2 At Synchrony, the average balance per active store-card account across the company was $935 in the second quarter, according to an analysis by Autonomous Research.\par \par \uc2 Affirm wouldn't issue cards, but its loans could provide some customers with another financing option. That could create new problems for Synchrony, the largest U.S. store credit-card issuer, whose shares have fallen 17% this year amid concern that rising defaults could hit profits. \uc2 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc\uc2 . bought Synchrony shares during the second quarter, giving the stock a boost last week.\par \par \uc2 U.S. consumers are once again taking on more debt, while credit-card charge-offs are rising following a long decline. Many retailers, under pressure from online competition, are seeking to expand their customers' access to financing as a way to boost sales.\par \par \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  is one of Synchrony's largest retail card partners, accounting for more than 10% of its total interest and fees on loans in 2016, according to data from the lender.\par \par \uc2 Synchrony, which spun out of \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 ., has been the exclusive \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  credit card issuer for the past 17 years.\par \par \uc2 It will keep that post, though some \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  shoppers could soon be deciding between signing up for a Synchrony credit card or an Affirm loan to make their \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  purchases.\par \par \uc2 Affirm and \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  have been in contact since 2014, but the talks picked up last year when \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  became more interested in increasing financing approvals for customers, one of the people said.\par \par \uc2 Retailers depend in part on their credit-card issuers to approve a large number of shoppers, hoping doing so will boost sales. The sales slump that has recently hit many retailers likely adds to that dependency, said Matthew O'Neill, an analyst at Autonomous Research who covers the store-credit card industry.\par \par \uc2 Wal-Mart\uc2  has so far bucked the retail trend as its U.S. same-store sales have risen for 12 straight quarters. The retail giant, however, is facing more competition from \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 More retailers have been seeking out alternative options separate from their credit-card issuers in an attempt to get more approvals. That includes signing up an additional lender that will approve borrowers that the primary lender won't.\par \par \uc2 For their part, card issuers must balance a desire to increase purchase volumes with a need to maintain credit quality and keep losses in check. That has grown more important over the past year as credit performance at card issuers has started to deteriorate after years of superlow default rates.\par \par \uc2 Synchrony is looking at making adjustments to its underwriting approaches with new technology and models, according to people familiar with the company. It is testing technology from vendors including ZestFinance, which has software that helps lenders determine the riskiness of consumers, including those with little to no credit history, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 In addition to helping to boost approvals, the efforts could help Synchrony to reduce fraud and losses, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Affirm last year began providing financing to shoppers at online home-goods retailer \uc2 Wayfair Inc\uc2 ., allowing them to spread the cost of the purchases over several months. Similarly, \uc2 Expedia Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Motorola Mobility LLC\uc2  are among the companies that have also tapped Affirm to complement or replace their existing credit-card relationships.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Finra Elects New Board Members\par \par \uc2 Wall Street's self-regulator announced the election of two governors to its board on Tuesday, including a \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . executive and the chief executive of a small brokerage. Stephen Cutler, a senior executive and vice chairman at J.P. Morgan, was elected to one of three spots designated for large firms on the \uc2 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\uc2 's board. Mr. Cutler has been serving on Finra's board since last November, when he was appointed to an unexpired term. Stephen Kohn, of Stephen A. Kohn & Associates, will take over as one of three small-firm governors on the board. Finra, one of the country's most powerful financial regulators, allows the industry it oversees to elect some of its officers. While Finra isn't a government agency and ultimately answers to the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , Congress has sanctioned its role as a standard-setter and rule-enforcer for the brokerage industry. Finra's board also completed several appointments that were announced at a June meeting.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Regulators Plan to Ease Capital Rules for Most Banks\par \par \uc2 All but the nation's largest banks got a temporary reprieve Tuesday from new capital standards aimed at megabanks that are set to go into effect next year. The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators are working on a proposal to apply different capital requirements on banks with less than $250 billion in assets from those set to take effect for the largest banks in January 2018. Regulators say they are working on the separate set of rules "to reduce regulatory burden, particularly for community banks." The agencies say they expect to propose the simplified capital rules in the coming months.\par \par \uc2 Chinese Investors Face New Roadblocks Investing Abroad\par \par \uc2 By Emma Johanningsmeier\par \par \uc2 After a record-breaking year for Chinese outbound M&A, Chinese investors are facing increasingly wary regulators in foreign governments\u8212\'20\'14and a Chinese government determined to control where they put their money.\par \par \uc2 China's total outbound M&A investing in the next decade could total $1.5 trillion, a recent report by international law firm Linklaters predicted. That is more than double the total from the past decade, according to Dealogic data, but is roughly flat when compared with current levels.\par \par \uc2 The first half of 2017 saw a total of $72.6 billion of outbound M&A from China, with Europe taking the largest share. That is far below Chinese outbound M&A in the first half of 2016, which hit a record-breaking $129.3 billion world-wide.\par \par \uc2 Among the forces driving this year's sober forecasts and sharp decrease are the Chinese government's crackdown on what it has described as "irrational" overseas deals, such as expensive real estate, that don't relate to investors' core businesses.\par \par \uc2 Although China hasn't discouraged outbound investing per se, it is applying a stricter standard of approving investments that support the national interest, according to James Stent, a banker and author of "China's Banking Transformation: The Untold Story."\par \par \uc2 "China's government now looks hard at overseas investments not arising out of core business strategies or serving national interests," Mr. Stent said. "It is restricting frivolous investments in overseas football teams, and by highly leveraged financial conglomerates whose acquisitions neither clearly serve the national interest nor arise out of a well-defined core business strategy."\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Chinese officials published official guidelines for overseas investment for the first time. The new rules will restrict investment in sectors such as hotels and sports teams, but not technologies such as computer chips.\par \par \uc2 Also likely to influence Chinese M&A investing patterns, however, are Western governments' moves to block Chinese companies from gaining too much control over domestic infrastructure and branching into industries where Chinese ownership might raise national security concerns.\par \par \uc2 Chinese forays into sectors such as energy infrastructure, high-end technology, and electronics face particular scrutiny abroad, the Linklaters report said. In one high-profile case, Australia blocked \uc2 China's State Grid Corp\uc2 . and Hong Kong-based \uc2 Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd\uc2 . from taking a 50.4% stake in the country's largest electricity network, Ausgrid, out of concerns for national security. At the time, Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said "In making this decision, national-interest concerns have been paramount."\par \par \uc2 The range of companies likely to face resistance over security worries also includes payment processing systems and credit ratings systems, firms which might allow Chinese companies gather consumer data.\par \par \uc2 "I think we're going to see a lot of concern about ultimate ownership" of such companies, said Ken DeWoskin, a senior adviser for Deloitte's Chinese Services Group.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S. this year, several deals have failed to get timely approval from the \uc2 Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S\uc2 . A $1.2 billion purchase of Dallas-based payment firm \uc2 MoneyGram International Inc\uc2 . by \uc2 Ant Financial Services Group\uc2 , which is controlled by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, a co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., is among those deals.\par \par \uc2 In July, The Wall Street Journal reported that the \uc2 Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S\uc2 . hadn't approved the deal by a deadline, leading Ant to refile its application.\par \par \uc2 In an op-ed column in the Journal, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross wrote "many governments across the globe have pursued policies that put American workers and businesses at a disadvantage," and added "For these governments, President Trump and his administration have a clear message: It is time to rebalance your trade policies so that they are fair, free and reciprocal."\par \par \uc2 Some European lawmakers have raised concerns about increased Chinese investment in Europe, citing a lack of reciprocity for European companies investing in China as one problem with the trend.

The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/business/dealbook/phone-hack-bitcoin-virtual-currency.html?_r=0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 New York Times reported}}}\uc2  that fraudsters are calling up Verizon, \uc2 AT&T\uc2 , Sprint and other telecommunication companies and convincing representatives to transfer control of a victim's phone number to hackers. From there, the bad guys reset passwords on all accounts that use the phone number as a backup. Cryptocurrency accounts are especially valuable, with thieves apparently scouring social media for financial chatter to identify victims.\par \par \uc2 IRS Tracking Bitcoin: The \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  has purchased software meant to track Americans who use bitcoin, according to a contract\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.thedailybeast.com/irs-now-has-a-tool-to-unmask-bitcoin-tax-cheats"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 obtained by the Daily Beast}}}\uc2 . The IRS claimed that only 802 people declared bitcoin losses or profits, a figure that may have contributed to the government's interest in tracking and analyzing bitcoin transactions.\par \par \uc2 FTC Examining A.I.: The \uc2 U.S. Federal Trade Commission\uc2  aims to more closely examine \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology "because it has a consumer protection element to it but also has a competition element," acting chair \uc2 Maureen Ohlhausen{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.axios.com/ftc-may-take-a-deeper-look-at-artificial-intelligence-2475755741.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 told Axios}}}\uc2 . Ms. Ohlhausen argued the FTC is equipped to handle new, high tech challenges that could include protecting customers from discriminatory algorithms and deceptive data collection.\par \par \uc2 Delaware Breach Notification: A revised version of the Delaware's data breach notification law, effective April 14, 2018, will require companies to notify affected individuals within 60 of learning of the incident. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2017/08/21/delaware-amends-data-breach-notification-law/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Hunton Privacy Blog}}}\uc2  breaks down the ramifications of the new rules, which expands the definition of personal information to include Social Security number, a driver's license or state ID number, financial card numbers, passport information, an online username or email address, medical information, biometric data, and an individual's taxpayer ID number.\par \par \uc2 No Opt Out Option: The home sound system device manufacturer Sonos {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/sonos-accept-new-privacy-policy-speakers-cease-to-function/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 confirmed to ZDNet}}}\uc2  that "if a customer chooses not to acknowledge the privacy statement, the customer will not be able to update the software on their Sonos system, and over time the functionality of the product will decrease." Translation: customers who don't agree to privacy rules allowing the collection of email addresses, IP addresses, and account login information will be stuck with systems that could eventually "cease to function." Privacy groups decried the policy as an apparent loss of user controls.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20170823ed8n0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Regulators are probing whether \uc2 Wells Fargo{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-faces-a-new-auto-loan-headache-1502210053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 improperly charged thousands of people for a type of auto insurance}}}\uc2  and made premium payments without customers' authorization. The bank says it ended the program in question, changed management and is in the process of refunding $80 million to customers.\par \par \uc2 The banking panel's 11 Democrats urged its chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2vWbdsE"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 letter}}}\uc2  earlier this month to invite \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  executives to a hearing. Because Mr. Crapo is trying to operate the committee in a bipartisan fashion, it would be difficult for him to ignore the request outright without alienating Democrats whose support he will need to advance an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/crapo-strikes-optimistic-tone-on-housing-finance-bill-1493314436"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ambitious legislative agenda}}}\uc2 , including an overhaul of \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Spokeswomen for Mr. Crapo and \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Republican lawmakers are generally reluctant to harangue top executives in public, but a decision not to call a hearing could cause the banking panel to effectively cede its turf to other lawmakers. A bipartisan group of senators from the Commerce Committee sent a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2wCFHRf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 letter}}}\uc2  this month to Wells Fargo Chief Executive \uc2 Timothy Sloan\uc2  seeking more information about the auto-insurance issues. The banking committee is unlikely to give up its jurisdiction to another panel.\par \par \uc2 (For its part, the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  is conducting an "independent, comprehensive and professional" investigation into \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , the panel's chairman, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), told House Democrats this month in a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Hensarling hasn't scheduled a hearing.)\par \par \uc2 Any hearing could complicate Republicans' efforts to kill a new \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  rule {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpb-completes-rule-allowing-class-action-lawsuits-against-banks-1499712133"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 barring banks from requiring customers to use arbitration to resolve disputes}}}\uc2 . The Senate Banking Committee's Democrats, who support the rule and oppose efforts to overturn it, said in their Aug. 1 letter that they would like to question \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  on its use of "forced arbitration" clauses, which prevented customers caught up in the fake-accounts scandal from suing in court for damages.\par \par \uc2 Drawing more public attention to \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 's missteps could be just the platform Democrats need to undercut the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-effort-to-overturn-arbitration-rule-at-risk-from-republican-defectors-1502020803"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 already-precarious GOP efforts to kill the CFPB rule}}}\uc2 .

That means banks are allowing more borrowers to lock in low rates for long periods, a potential risk should rates move sharply higher.\par \par \uc2 Regulators and bank investors typically worry about interest-rate risk because banks borrow money at low rates on a short-term basis, usually by taking deposits, and lend it out at higher rates for a longer term. That can create a mismatch if rates go up quickly.

Mr. Cutler has been serving on Finra's board since last November, when he was appointed to an unexpired term. Stephen Kohn, of Stephen A.

The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators are working on a proposal to apply different capital requirements on banks with less than $250 billion in assets from those set to take effect for the largest banks in January 2018. Regulators say they are working on the separate set of rules "to reduce regulatory burden, particularly for community banks."

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Tulip.io Inc., whose mobile software allows sales associates and retailers to engage more effectively with customers, has raised $40 million in a new round of venture-capital financing led by \uc2 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The financing, which marks \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2 ' largest investment in a Canadian technology startup, will help Tulip double its staff, expand to retailers in Europe, South America and Asia as well as develop its software for other industries such as the hospitality sector.\par \par \uc2 Toronto-based Tulip provides a platform that gives sales associates real-time access to consumer preferences and customer data on a mobile or tablet device. The company's software is already being used by major U.S. retailers such as Hudson's Bay Co.'s Saks Fifth Avenue and \uc2 Coach Inc\uc2 ., and is used across 25 countries and in 7 languages. It is also a member of \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 .'s Mobility Partner Program alongside \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Cisco Systems Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 SAP SE\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While customers are increasingly going online to buy goods, in-store purchases remain a strong driver of retail sales, according to a recent survey published by Deloitte and commissioned by Tulip. Roughly 70% of survey respondents said more than half of their sales come from physical stores.\par \par \uc2 To help stem losses from online competitors, Tulip assists brick-and-mortar retailers to train their sales staff to provide a more personalized shopping experience with their customers. A major U.S. retailer reported a 4% increase in year-over-year sales and a 2% customer conversion rate in stores using Tulip's technology, according to the company.\par \par \uc2 "The main focus with this capital is us, with Kleiner, thinking we can go international faster if we can fund some of that growth ahead of plan," said \uc2 Ali Asaria\uc2 , Tulip's Chief Executive.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the investment round, Mood Rowghani, general partner at \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2 , will also join Tulip's board. Mr. Rowghani said he visited three stores in California that use Tulip's technology before agreeing to invest in the company and believes its platform can help bridge the divide between traditional retailers and e-commerce.\par \par \uc2 "Traditional retailers have this treasure trove of intimate knowledge of their customers," said Mr. Rowghani. "It's a huge opportunity if they're armed with the right tools and be able to marry it with digital technology. Tulip is at the core of that experience."\par \par \uc2 Tulip was founded in 2013 after Mr. Asaria stepped down as CEO of Well.ca, a Canadian-based e-commerce website that specializes in beauty and wellness products. Tulip has previously raised about $11 million from a series of investors, including SoftTech VC, Chicago-based Jump Capital and Fung Capital USA, and has about 130 staff in Toronto and Kitchener, Ontario.\par \par \uc2 Before founding e-commerce companies, Mr. Asaria cut his teeth as a software developer at \uc2 BlackBerry Inc\uc2 . where he created one of the company's first games for its smartphones. The executive declined to comment on Tulip's current valuation.\par \par \uc2 "We have a long-term 20-year plan for this company," Mr. Asaria said. "We want to build one of the largest enterprise companies and we want to find investors that are interested in that long-term alignment." He added that the size of the funding round should be enough to sustain the company's growth for the next five years, after which it will explore a possible IPO.\par \par \uc2 The investment also marks the latest sign of a maturing Canadian technology sector with \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2  being the latest major U.S. venture-capital firm to invest in a Canadian startup. Last year, a fund managed by \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . led a round of financing with Toronto-based Hubba Inc., while \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  developer Element AI secured a $102 million Series A round of funding led by Data Collective in June.\par \par \uc2 U.S. investment in Canadian technology startups reached 1.06 billion Canadian dollars (US$842 million) last year, more than triple what was spent in 2010, according to \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Write to David George-Cosh at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:david.george-cosh@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 david.george-cosh@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170822ed8m001jl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The company declined to disclose the valuation for the round.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2013 by the team behind the Apache Spark data-processing engine, Databricks today has more than 500 customers globally, including \uc2 Viacom Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell PLC\uc2 , and \uc2 Salesforce.com Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Databricks sells a cloud-based \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  platform based on Spark, a popular open-source tool used to analyze data in real time. The platform lets data-science teams communicate and share information with data engineering and lines of business teams to build and manage data products. Databricks also offers managed cloud infrastructure services.\par \par \uc2 The company plans to use the money to invest further in its Unified \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Platform and hire engineers and customer-focused technology staff. The goal, co-founder and chief executive Ali Ghodsi said, is to make \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  projects simpler for enterprises and midmarket customers.\par \par \uc2 Large companies have embraced \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to automate routine tasks, cut costs, and free employees to focus on value-added activities. AI systems also are helping companies to detect trends from ever-growing troves of data.\par \par \uc2 Despite the hype around corporate AI, however, many large businesses still aren't seeing the same results as companies such as \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . or \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . that employ throngs of well-paid engineers and data scientists, Mr. Ghodsi said. Many projects still suffer from a lack of useful collaboration between line-of-business domain experts and data scientists, and many firms are burdened with complex software configurations and costly infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 With the latest round of financing, Databricks also plans to expand markets through industry-specific applications spanning health care and life sciences; financial services; and media.\par \par \uc2 Ben Horowitz, co-founder and general partner of \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , a longtime Databricks investor, said he's seen a shift in thinking by big companies in recent years about how they run large-scale \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  initiatives. While many firms originally sought to host \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  applications on premise, they now have begun to embrace cloud computing to run big projects.\par \par \uc2 Companies realize that "if I'm doing AI, I'm going to need to be able to scale up the number of machines and use specialized things," Mr. Horowitz said. "Just owning it becomes more and more ridiculous."\par \par \uc2 Write to Steve Norton at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:steve.norton@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 steve.norton@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170822ed8m000b5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Morgan\uc2  Donating Up to $2 Million After Charlottesville\par \par \uc2 Analysis: The Price Isn't Right for Home Builders\par \par \uc2 The EU's Financial-Regulation Priorities\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Union\uc2 's executive arm gets back to business in the coming weeks. EU financial-services chief Valdis Dombrovskis has his work cut out for him, from navigating Brexit negotiations to smoothing the way for rules still in the pipeline. Here are big issues to watch for on Europe's financial-regulation calendar over the coming months.\par \par \uc2 Developments in the U.S. Mr. Dombrovskis and EU regulators are keeping an eye on the U.S. as the Trump administration moves to dismantle certain postcrisis rules. The EU, conversely, aims to wrap up work on some of its own postcrisis regulations, such as Mifid II, due to come into effect next year.\par \par \uc2 The EU's financial-services chief has warned about the review of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, saying he wants to prevent a race to the bottom that could threaten global financial stability. The commissioner has said he would watch for any proposals seeking to postpone the implementation of standards already agreed on by global regulators. Those include two regulations from the \uc2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\uc2 : the "net stable funding ratio," which would require banks to hold enough cash assets to cover their expected outflows over a one-year horizon, and the related "fundamental review of the trading book," which is meant to rein in banks' trading risks. Both rules are part of the Basel III capital standards.\par \par \uc2 Basel IV. The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  will try to reach an agreement on new Basel standards, dubbed Basel IV. European banks say that proposed rules on how banks should calculate the riskiness of their assets would further help U.S. banks. Meanwhile, U.S. officials say relying on internal risk models allows EU banks to artificially lower capital requirements.\par \par \uc2 The EU's supervisory architecture. The commission this year launched a review of the European supervisory authorities and a legislative proposal is expected in September that could strengthen their hand. The review assesses the \uc2 European Banking Authority\uc2 , the \uc2 European Securities and Markets Authority\uc2 , and the \uc2 Single Resolution Board\uc2 . Paris-based ESMA is expected to receive new powers and the possibility of direct supervision over clearing.\par \par \uc2 Brexit. The new home of the \uc2 European Banking Authority\uc2 , currently based in London, will be decided by October in a secret-ballot vote of EU member states. Meanwhile, several months ago the commission released a communication outlining its approach to so-called equivalence, which allows non-EU financial-services providers to do business in Europe if they are deemed to be subject to standards on par with the bloc's own. The commission is seeking to strengthen the monitoring of equivalence decisions as the U.K. prepares to exit the bloc.\par \par \uc2 Clearing. The commission introduced a legislative proposal in June that could allow EU authorities to force clearinghouses that do a large chunk of business in euros to move into the bloc. The move means London is at risk of losing its dominance over the multitrillion-dollar clearinghouse sector. The measure will be fiercely debated in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  and then by the member states, which need to approve the legislation. Mr. Dombrovskis has repeatedly said the EU's new policy on supervising clearing wouldn't affect arrangements with the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 SEC, Hedge Fund Settle Insider-Trading Probe Tied to Political Intelligence\par \par \uc2 By Brody Mullins and Juliet Chung\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A large New York hedge fund has agreed to a multimillion-dollar fine to settle what is shaping up to be a major crackdown by the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  on Washington's political-intelligence industry.\par \par \uc2 The firm, \uc2 Deerfield Management Co. LP\uc2 , agreed to pay $4.6 million to settle charges from the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  that it failed to have adequate internal safeguards to ensure that managers didn't make trades based on inside information they received from consultants.\par \par \uc2 In May, the Justice Department and SEC announced insider-trading charges against Deerfield employees, as well as an official at a health-care agency.\par \par \uc2 Federal prosecutors also filed charges against a consultant whose job it was to mine the government for information about coming policy changes that could be used to trade stocks.\par \par \uc2 According to the charges, the Washington analyst obtained nonpublic, market-moving information from a low-level employee of the \uc2 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\uc2  and relayed it to the Deerfield employees, who traded on it.\par \par \uc2 The trades generated more than $3.9 million in profits from at least May 2012 to November 2013, according to the government.\par \par \uc2 "Deerfield relied on political intelligence firms, creating a risk that it would receive and trade on illegal inside information," said Robert Cohen, the co-head of the SEC enforcement division's market abuse unit, in a statement. "As it turns out, that is exactly what happened."\par \par \uc2 Some people familiar with Deerfield were relieved at the result.\par \par \uc2 "We are pleased to have resolved this matter," a company spokesman said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The firm wasn't required to admit guilt; its managing partner wasn't charged with wrongdoing; the fine was in line with expectations; and the nature of the charge was less serious than if the SEC had found Deerfield was complicit in the insider trading. But uncertainty remains over how the Justice Department charges will play out.\par \par \uc2 The government is still pursuing charges against two Deerfield employees; the Washington consultant, David Blaszczak, and the former government employee Christopher Worrall. Efforts to reach Messrs. Blaszczak and Worrall were unsuccessful.\par \par \uc2 In the settlement, which was announced Monday, the SEC said the hedge fund didn't have adequate controls to prevent employees from trading on insider information. The lack of oversight "placed the burden on its own employees to police themselves by identifying issues and informing supervisors," the SEC said in a press release.\par \par \uc2 The SEC said in the statement that Deerfield employees who traded on the information from the Washington consultant should have been wary that the information could be illicit.\par \par \uc2 In one email to Deerfield, the Washington consultant said he "heard from a reliable CMS source" that the health-care agency planned to make an announcement that would affect stock prices of certain health-care companies.\par \par \uc2 Another email sent between two employees at Deerfield noted that the Washington consultant, Mr. Blaszczak, "has a guy" at a government meeting.\par \par \uc2 The emails were quoted by the SEC's settlement Monday.\par \par \uc2 It is illegal for individuals to trade stocks based on material, nonpublic information from companies as well as the government.\par \par \uc2 For more than a decade, hedge funds and other investors have hired an array of lobbyists, consultants and other insiders to find tips about coming decisions by the government that they can use to trade stocks.\par \par \uc2 The SEC and other regulators have become concerned some of the tips relayed to Wall Street could violate insider-trading rules. The SEC has pursued several investigations into such cases.\par \par \uc2 The matter involving the Deerfield employees and Mr. Blaszczak has gone the furthest. The SEC settled a prior investigation into a separate political intelligence firm in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Deerfield's assets under management had fallen by about 15% by June since the Justice Department and SEC filed charges against the Deerfield traders in May, the firm told investors at a June meeting, according to a person in attendance.\par \par \uc2 The withdrawals affected Deerfield's hedge fund. The bulk of the firm's assets under management are in its private credit funds, which lock up client money for years. Deerfield managed about $8 billion at the end of 2016, according to a person close to the firm, including funds that had been committed to the private credit funds.\par \par \uc2 At the June meeting, executives said investor redemption requests would be paid out in cash and that the firm had been thinking of returning some money to clients at some point anyway. Executives also said the firm was fully cooperating with the Justice Department and SEC and had handed over millions of documents to those agencies.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Where Was Wells Fargo's Auditor?\par \par \uc2 By Francine Mckenna and Andrea Riquier\par \par \uc2 As calls for the replacement of \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 's board mount, experts say attention \u8212\'20\'14 and blame \u8212\'20\'14 for a continuing pattern of misbehavior should also be focused on the company's external auditor, KPMG LLP.\par \par \uc2 The record of management failures at Wells WFC, +0.27% started with revelations last year that millions of accounts had been opened illicitly. It got longer after the admission last month that the bank had also forced unneeded auto insurance on customers and neglected to refund optional guaranteed asset protection, so-called GAP, coverage for auto loan borrowers.\par \par \uc2 Politicians and regulators see the misbehavior as a pattern that should have been caught \u8212\'20\'14 and stopped. And there have been consequences for the bank. One CEO was forced to step down and forfeit millions of dollars in incentive compensation. Thousands of workers, including several executives, have been fired. Most recently the bank reshuffled its board, replacing its chairman and adjusting board committee memberships including on its audit and examination committee.\par \par \uc2 But external auditors should serve as another line of defense. Each year, auditors offer an opinion on whether their clients' financial statements are truthful. To do so, the auditors have to determine whether they have enough confidence in the company's internal controls to offer that blessing.\par \par \uc2 "There's been far too little attention since the crisis on how the external auditors should be looking out for the public," Andy Green, managing director of economic policy for the Center for American Progress, told MarketWatch.\par \par \uc2 "They are not just bookkeepers, but the investors', and the capital markets' last defense against accounting manipulation and fraud."\par \par \uc2 KPMG has served as Well's auditor for more than 85 years \u8212\'20\'14 the entire time spanned by the most recent customer scandals, and then some. As Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Mazie Hirono, and Edward Markey wrote to KPMG in October 2016, each year the auditor blessed Wells with a clean audit opinion and its finding that the bank had "maintained\u8230\'20\'26. effective internal control over financial reporting."\par \par \uc2 Warren and Markey also wrote to KPMG's regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), to ask whether it had reviewed KPMG's decisions on the Wells audits and if PCAOB rules hold auditors responsible for reporting illegal or inappropriate activity by their clients.\par \par \uc2 A PCAOB spokeswoman told MarketWatch that the agency did respond to the senators' request but declined further comment.\par \par \uc2 KPMG's response to the senators in November acknowledged that its audits of \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 's financial statements included procedures to identify instances of unethical and illegal conduct.\par \par \uc2 Those procedures included interviews with the company's chief auditor, members of the bank's Corporate Investigations Unit, bank financial executives, and attorneys inside and outside the bank, the auditor wrote. KPMG also reviews regulatory reports and reporting to executive management, the audit committee and the rest of the board from the chief compliance officer regarding investigations that related to accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing, and whistleblower claims and claims of retaliation.\par \par \uc2 KPMG wrote it did become aware, as early as 2013, of "instances of unethical and illegal conduct by \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  employees, including incidents involving these improper sales practices." But the firm said it was "satisfied that the appropriate members of management were fully informed with respect to such conduct."\par \par \uc2 Yet the auditor said nothing about these issues to investors, either in its audit opinion, its opinion on the bank's internal controls, or elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Instead, KPMG told the senators, its view is that "not every illegal act has a meaningful impact on a company's financial statements or its system of internal controls over financial reporting. From the facts developed to date, including those set out in the CFPB settlement, the misconduct described did not implicate any key control over financial reporting and the amounts reportedly involved did not significantly impact the bank's financial statements."\par \par \uc2 KPMG did not respond to a request for comment from MarketWatch for this article.\par \par \uc2 But the fallout from the scandals are certainly having a meaningful impact on the company.\par \par \uc2 Wells' stock is down 5.6% in the year to date, compared with a 6.2% gain for the Financial Select SPDR exchange-traded fund XLF, -0.28% and 9% gain for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.12% The company has paid hundreds of millions in fines and is in talks to pay hundreds of millions more in a class-action settlement for the illicit accounts. Municipalities from Los Angeles to Illinois are divesting from securities holdings with the bank, and canceling contracts.\par \par \uc2 What can shareholders do if they believe an auditor isn't doing its job? The audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for hiring, evaluating, and, possibly, firing the auditor. In this case the board recommended rehiring KPMG every year and asked shareholders to vote yes for reappointment at every annual meeting.\par \par \uc2 But when a situation is as tumultuous as Wells' is, the board may be in turmoil. On Tuesday \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . said \uc2 Elizabeth Duke\uc2 , the current board vice-chairman, would become chairman on Jan. 1, replacing \uc2 Stephen Sanger\uc2  who will retire.

Among the factors behind the rally: On a price-to-book basis, the shares of many home builders looked relatively cheap at the start of the year. Mortgage rates also were edging lower. Finally, home builders were seen as a major beneficiary of any corporate tax cut since, as domestically focused companies, their rates tend to be high.\par \par \uc2 But the rally has taken valuations into rarefied air. Meanwhile, home builders are facing rising costs that, low rates or not, they will find difficult to pass on to home buyers. As investors wake up to that, the prices of their shares and those of exchange-traded funds such as the \uc2 iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF\uc2  could drop significantly.\par \par \uc2 Finding workers is a problem that is getting successively worse for builders. Many of the carpenters, framing-crew members and roofers that worked in construction during the housing boom moved on to other work or retired, while memories of the housing bust made it so that fewer young people have been eager to enter those professions. President Donald Trump's tougher stance on immigration also is cutting into the available pool of labor.\par \par \uc2 In a recent survey conducted by the \uc2 National Association of Home Builders\uc2 , 19% of respondents said there was a serious shortage in workers across nine construction trade groups. That was the highest percentage since 2000. In the same survey, builders reported that labor costs were up an average of 4.5% versus a year earlier\u8212\'20\'14far more than overall U.S. labor costs.\par \par \uc2 Materials costs are rising, too. Ready-mix concrete prices were up 3.2% from a year earlier in July, and prices for gypsum products were up 9.9%. Prices for lumber, which represent about a tenth of builders' costs, have risen sharply after tariffs were placed on Canadian softwood lumber imports.\par \par \uc2 To preserve profit margins, builders could raise prices, but they are already so high that it could prove difficult. The median price for a new home was $315,000 in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department, which compared with $236,000 five years earlier. The NAHB's measure of new-home affordability, which is based on prices, family income data and mortgage rates, has fallen to its lowest level since 2007. If mortgage rates rebound then new home prices will be even further out of reach for many buyers.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, stock valuations have steepened. Among the top 10 home builders by market capitalization, the median price-to-book ratio, based on analysts' expected book value over the next year, is 1.2 compared with 1.06 at the start of the year, according to FactSet.\par \par \uc2 And, on a price-to-earnings basis, the group looks downright expensive. Among those 10 top home builders, nine were publicly traded during the housing bubble. Their median P/E ratio, based on analysts' expected earnings over the next year, is 11.3. In July 2005, when home-builder stocks reached their peak, that P/E was 8.5. It wouldn't take much\u8212\'20\'14a move higher in interest rates, say, or the dream of lower taxes going away\u8212\'20\'14for them to get nailed.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Ernst & Young Staff Supported CEO Quitting Trump Council\par \par \uc2 As Ernst & Young chief Mark Weinberger and other CEOs weighed whether to disband the presidential advisory council they served on, a majority of EY employees appeared to be lining up behind such a move.

Pozen and S.P. Kothari\par \par \uc2 Every year, shareholders of U.S. companies weigh in on executive pay by casting advisory votes on the reports of compensation committees. The committees are appointed by corporate boards to make recommendations about appropriate pay levels. Shareholders tend to take their reports at face value, voting to approve them in over 97% of cases. But their confidence is undermined by a lack of awareness about the often flawed methods compensation committees use to determine pay.\par \par \uc2 The trouble is that compensation committees frequently rely on faulty performance metrics that inflate executive pay. But the committee reports do not provide a sufficient explanation of these metrics to shareholders.\par \par \uc2 First, their reports routinely use "adjusted" earnings that are much higher than the figures calculated under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. While many companies tout adjusted numbers in their press releases on earnings, regulations require these releases to give their GAAP figures equal prominence. By contrast, there is no similar rule for compensation reports, which may use only the adjusted numbers without quantifying their differences from GAAP.\par \par \uc2 Take \uc2 Merck & Co\uc2 ., whose CEO had a bonus goal for 2015 of $3.40 in adjusted earnings per share. The compensation committee concluded that he had met that target, since the company's adjusted earnings were $3.56 per share. But the committee's report failed to mention that GAAP earnings were only $1.56 per share.\par \par \uc2 This example is not unique. In 2015, 93 companies in the S&P 500 announced adjusted earnings that were more than 50% above their GAAP earnings. At most of these firms, the compensation committees set executive pay using the adjusted earnings without quantifying how they differed from GAAP metrics.\par \par \uc2 There are valid reasons for excluding certain expenses from the GAAP figures. The costs of one-time events like layoffs might reasonably be omitted when calculating CEO pay. But most compensation reports don't provide sufficient justifications for these omissions. For example, they may write-off "one-time" restructurings that their companies actually undergo almost every year.\par \par \uc2 More broadly, compensation reports often leave out expenses that truly ought to factor into executive pay, such as litigation settlements for alleged financial misstatements by management. Depreciation and amortization are excluded on the grounds that they are not core operating expenses. Yet they represent wear and tear on the plant and equipment that generate operating income. Committees also exclude taxes, although tax management is clearly relevant to financial performance.\par \par \uc2 Committees frequently exclude expenses for granting restricted shares or stock options. In 2014 LinkedIn projected adjusted income of $950 million for the following year, but only by excluding $630 million of stock-related grants given to its executives. But it seems wrong to calculate pay packages for top managers with a metric that omits the cost of grants made to those same managers.\par \par \uc2 A second problem is that when compensation committees compare what CEOs make at similar firms, they often use an inappropriate set of peers. To provide a fair benchmark, peer companies should be of similar size. But often compensation committees choose peers bigger than themselves, most likely because bigger companies have higher executive pay.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute found that companies with relatively high executive pay were 25% smaller than their self-selected peers by revenue and 45% smaller by market cap. Or consider \uc2 Office Depot\uc2  , whose filings we examined. Of the 20 companies in its peer group, all had higher market capitalizations and 13 had higher revenues. It isn't hard to see how this is likely to skew executive compensation upward.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, although CEOs get large rewards for beating their peer group's average, the penalties for underperforming are usually modest. Take Merck in 2015: Its annualized shareholder return over the previous three years ranked in the bottom quartile of its self-selected peer group, but its CEO still received 80% of the possible payout for that metric.\par \par \uc2 What's the solution? The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  should require compensation committees to explain and quantify the differences between GAAP earnings and any adjusted figures they use. Committees should also be required to disclose the revenues and market capitalizations of the peers they select.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, shareholders should become more proactive about advisory votes on executive pay. Institutional investors should formulate public guidelines for compensation committees to follow. Companies should then hold conference calls in which the committee members would explain any variances.\par \par \uc2 Setting executive pay will always be a tricky process, since the goal is to reflect performance while attracting top talent. To help shareholders accurately judge pay packages, compensation committees must use clearer and more standardized metrics.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pozen is a senior lecturer and Mr. Kothari is a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management.

Morgan\uc2  Donating Up to $2 Million After Charlottesville\par \par \uc2 Analysis: The Price Isn't Right for Home Builders\par \par \uc2 The EU's Financial-Regulation Priorities\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Union\uc2 's executive arm gets back to business in the coming weeks. EU financial-services chief Valdis Dombrovskis has his work cut out for him, from navigating Brexit negotiations to smoothing the way for rules still in the pipeline. Here are big issues to watch for on Europe's financial-regulation calendar over the coming months.\par \par \uc2 Developments in the U.S. Mr. Dombrovskis and EU regulators are keeping an eye on the U.S. as the Trump administration moves to dismantle certain postcrisis rules. The EU, conversely, aims to wrap up work on some of its own postcrisis regulations, such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-reaches-deal-on-regulating-financial-instruments-1389740136"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mifid II}}}\uc2 , due to come into effect next year.\par \par \uc2 The EU's financial-services chief {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-financial-services-chief-warns-on-dodd-frank-review-and-deregulation-1499427285"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 has warned about the review of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act}}}\uc2 , saying he wants to prevent a race to the bottom that could threaten global financial stability. The commissioner has said he would watch for any proposals seeking to postpone the implementation of standards already agreed on by global regulators. Those include two regulations from the \uc2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\uc2 : the "net stable funding ratio," which would require banks to hold enough cash assets to cover their expected outflows over a one-year horizon, and the related "fundamental review of the trading book," which is meant to rein in banks' trading risks. Both rules are part of the Basel III capital standards.\par \par \uc2 Basel IV. The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  will try to reach an agreement on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-europe-spat-over-bank-risk-set-to-drag-on-1483531585"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 new Basel standards, dubbed Basel IV}}}\uc2 . European banks say that proposed rules on how banks should calculate the riskiness of their assets would further help U.S. banks. Meanwhile, U.S. officials say relying on internal risk models allows EU banks to artificially lower capital requirements.\par \par \uc2 The EU's supervisory architecture. The commission this year launched a review of the European supervisory authorities and a legislative proposal is expected in September that could strengthen their hand. The review assesses the \uc2 European Banking Authority\uc2 , the \uc2 European Securities and Markets Authority\uc2 , and the \uc2 Single Resolution Board\uc2 . Paris-based ESMA is expected to receive new powers and the possibility of direct supervision over clearing.\par \par \uc2 Brexit. The new home of the \uc2 European Banking Authority\uc2 , currently based in London, will be decided by October in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-wants-secret-ballot-on-post-brexit-location-of-european-agencies-1495637188"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 secret-ballot vote of EU member states}}}\uc2 . Meanwhile, several months ago the commission released a communication outlining its approach to so-called {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-explains-equivalence-rules-for-financial-services-firms-1488225779"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 equivalence}}}\uc2 , which allows non-EU financial-services providers to do business in Europe if they are deemed to be subject to standards on par with the bloc's own. The commission is seeking to strengthen the monitoring of equivalence decisions as the U.K. prepares to exit the bloc.\par \par \uc2 Clearing. The commission {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-first-brexit-shot-it-wants-clearing-back-from-london-1497353899"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 introduced a legislative proposal in June}}}\uc2  that could allow EU authorities to force clearinghouses that do a large chunk of business in euros to move into the bloc. The move means London is at risk of losing its dominance over the multitrillion-dollar clearinghouse sector. The measure will be fiercely debated in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  and then by the member states, which need to approve the legislation. Mr. Dombrovskis has repeatedly said the EU's new policy on supervising clearing wouldn't affect arrangements with the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 SEC, Hedge Fund Settle Insider-Trading Probe Tied to Political Intelligence\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deerfield-resolves-insider-trading-probe-with-sec-1503351143"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A large New York hedge fund has agreed}}}\uc2  to a multimillion-dollar fine to settle what is shaping up to be a major crackdown by the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  on Washington's political-intelligence industry.\par \par \uc2 Deerfield Management Co\uc2 . agreed to pay $4.6 million to settle charges from the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  that it failed to have adequate internal safeguards to ensure that managers didn't make trades based on inside information they received from consultants.\par \par \uc2 In May, the Justice Department and SEC announced insider-trading charges against Deerfield employees, as well as an official at a health-care agency. Federal prosecutors also filed charges against a consultant whose job it was to mine the government for information about coming policy changes that could be used to trade stocks.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Where Was Wells Fargo's Auditor?\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://on.mktw.net/2ia1LNj"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 KPMG LLP has been Wells Fargo & Co.'s auditor}}}\uc2  for more than 85 years.\par \par \uc2 As calls to replace the bank's board mount in the wake of the recent customer scandals, experts say some of the attention for a continuing pattern of misbehavior should also be focused on KPMG.\par \par \uc2 The auditor wrote to senators that it became aware, as early as 2013, of "instances of unethical and illegal conduct by \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  employees, including incidents involving these improper sales practices." But the firm said it was "satisfied that the appropriate members of management were fully informed with respect to such conduct." The auditor didn't mention these issues to investors in its audit opinion, its opinion on the bank's internal controls, or elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  Donating Up to $2 Million After Charlottesville\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-donates-up-to-2-million-to-organizations-following-charlottesville-1503326740"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. plans to donate}}}\uc2  as much as $2 million to human- and civil-rights organizations, including the \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\uc2  and \uc2 Anti-Defamation League\uc2 , after the recent clashes in Charlottesville, Va.\par \par \uc2 The move comes after bank chief James Dimon said in an employee memo last week that he strongly disagreed with President Donald Trump's reaction to the violence. "The events in Charlottesville have increased the urgency to confront hate, intolerance and discrimination wherever it exists," the bank said in an internal memo sent Monday that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Bruce Tuckman Appointed Chief Economist at CFTC\par \par \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo appointed \uc2 New York University\uc2 's Bruce Tuckman to be the derivatives regulator's chief economist on Monday. Mr. Tuckman, a finance professor at NYU's Stern School of Business, has written extensively on postcrisis regulation of derivatives and fixed income markets. Before academia, he worked on Wall Street for \uc2 Barclays Capital\uc2 , \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  and Salomon Brothers. Recently, he contributed to a Stern white paper that argued postcrisis regulations have neglected the need for resolution plans for derivatives clearinghouses. Mr. Giancarlo also said Monday that he would bring back former CFTC chief economist Sayee Srinivasan, who was appointed under Democratic Chairman Gary Gensler, to serve as a special adviser in the chairman's office.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: The Price Isn't Right for Home Builders\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-isnt-right-for-home-builders-1503394204"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Shares of home builders}}}\uc2  look pricey and vulnerable to a correction as costs rise and affordability is strained.\par \par \uc2 To preserve profit margins, builders could raise prices, but they are already so high that it could prove difficult. The median price for a new home was $315,000 in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department, which compared with $236,000 five years earlier. The \uc2 National Association of Home Builders\uc2  measure of new-home affordability, which is based on prices, family income data and mortgage rates, has fallen to its lowest level since 2007. If mortgage rates rebound then new home prices will be even further out of reach for many buyers.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-talk-daily-analysis-roundup-1503354446"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Read our compilation of concise, timely analysis}}}\uc2  by Wall Street Journal reporters.

Deposits from outside the country accounted for about 20% of total bank deposits in July, down from more than 24% in May.\par \par \uc2 The fall in foreign deposits in June and July came despite local banks offering higher interest rates to woo customers. Analysts expect a further decline as many customers, especially from the Gulf countries, are unlikely to renew their deposits upon maturity amid concerns over repatriation.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday, Aug. 22\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Finra will hold its annual meeting of firms to elect individuals to fill one small-firm and one large-firm seat on its board of governors.

"This interest in transparency may be due in part to the fact that, even as the obligations of audit committees have expanded over the years, required audit committee disclosures have not," the report says, adding that disclosure obligations in this area predate the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Among the findings: The share of companies disclosing factors used in the audit committee's assessment of the external auditor's qualifications and work quality increased to 56% in 2017 from 48% in 2016. In 2012, 17% of companies made such disclosures.\par \par \uc2 How to Help Narrow the Homeownership Gap\par \par \uc2 As Congress and the Trump administration consider a housing-finance overhaul, it's time to look into how the system could be changed to improve housing affordability and encourage more private capital to flow into the sector, writes Karen Shaw Petrou {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2whP5tO"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 for American Banker}}}\uc2 . Ms. Petrou, a managing partner at \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , lays out five ideas: directing government subsidies to borrowers who need the most help; pushing \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  to subsidize credit risk transfers only for underserved markets; putting limits on people borrowing against the value of their homes; encouraging banks to make higher-risk loans safely; and improving the design of mortgage products for ill-served borrowers and communities.\par \par \uc2 Compensation Committees Need Clearer Metrics\par \par \uc2 Companies' compensation committees often rely on flawed metrics to make recommendations on executive pay, but many shareholders don't understand the problem and in more than 97% of cases they vote to approve the numbers before them, write Robert C. Pozen and S.P. Kothari in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-the-ceo-is-overpaid-blame-the-compensation-committee-1503355104"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Wall Street Journal opinion column}}}\uc2 . The solution is for the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  to require compensation panels to "explain and quantify the differences" between figures calculated under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and any adjusted numbers they use, say the authors, a senior lecturer and a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management. "To help shareholders accurately judge pay packages, compensation committees must use clearer and more standardized metrics," they conclude.\par \par \uc2 Investors yanked money out of emerging-market funds for the first time in months, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-calm-in-emerging-markets-suddenly-broke-1503316745"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a sign of trouble in what has been a sturdy corner of the market}}}\uc2  for much of the year.\par \par \uc2 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said there was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mitch-mcconnell-zero-chance-u-s-fails-to-raise-debt-ceiling-1503336757"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 "zero chance" that the U.S. would fail to raise}}}\uc2  the federal debt ceiling.

They were among those that pitched their companies at \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 's 25th Demo Day in Mountain View, Calif., Monday.\par \par \uc2 But building such technology is difficult outside of big companies such as \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . That's because of the need for engineering talent, massive computing power and large data sets to test their algorithms against.\par \par \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  provides these things to its AI startups, such as free time working with OpenAI, the nonprofit AI research entity founded by Y Combinator President \uc2 Sam Altman\uc2  and Tesla CEO Elon Musk; up to $250,000 in computing time to test its models, and access to data sets that companies may need.\par \par \uc2 "There are things big companies have in the \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  world that startups do not," said \uc2 Daniel Gross\uc2 , a \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  partner who heads the AI track and who previously sold his startup to Apple. "We feared that without our help we wouldn't see these great AI companies exist."\par \par \uc2 The startups in the batch range from AssemblyAI, a speech recognition startup, to Plasticity, which helps computers understand language better, to Modular Science, a robot for farming.\par \par \uc2 Other companies include May Mobility Inc., an autonomous vehicle startup that works in enclosed geographic areas. The company is slated to launch in downtown Detroit in October, said Steve Vozar, chief technology officer.\par \par \uc2 Zendar is a high-resolution radar technology startup for autonomous vehicles. LIDAR and cameras are common high resolution navigation sensors used for autonomous vehicles, but they do not work well in bad weather. Meanwhile, traditional radar can see in bad weather but isn't high resolution. But Zendar provides the best of both worlds, the company said.\par \par \uc2 Another company, D-ID, helps protect people from hacking via facial recognition technology. The company processes images as a way to prevent facial recognition algorithms from identifying people in an image\u8212\'20\'14even though the images look the same to the human eye. This could prevent hacking into devices that use facial recognition to unlock devices and other systems.\par \par \uc2 The challenges that these types of companies discuss at their \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  meetings isn't usually technical, Mr. Gross said. It is typically other business or marketing problems such as how to convey the accuracy of an algorithm for completely new technology to customers or consumers, he said.\par \par \uc2 "We want to enable the next generation of AI-first founders," Mr. Gross said.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170822ed8m00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Alpert \par \uc2 622 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 August 2017\par 23:52\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Bankruptcy\par \uc2 RSTPROBK\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 Tronc Inc\uc2 . is undergoing a broad management shake-up at its flagship newspaper, the \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2 , bringing in internet and media industry veteran Ross Levinsohn as its new chief executive and publisher.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Levinsohn, who was an interim CEO at Yahoo and had a top role at Fox Interactive Media, replaces Davan Maharaj, a 28-year veteran of the Times, \uc2 Tronc\uc2  announced on Monday. Mr. Maharaj had been named publisher in 2016 in addition to his role as editor in chief as \uc2 Tronc\uc2  moved to consolidate the roles across its 11 daily newspapers.\par \par \uc2 Several other senior editors at the paper were also dismissed, the LA Times reported.\par \par \uc2 Jim Kirk, who until recently had served as publisher and editor in chief of the Chicago Sun-Times until being hired by \uc2 Tronc\uc2  earlier this month following a failed acquisition bid, was named interim executive editor to spearhead the search for a new editor in chief, the company said.\par \par \uc2 The moves highlight the central role the Times has played for \uc2 Tronc\uc2  in its efforts to digitally transform a company that over the years has endured a long-running bankruptcy, a spinoff, an ugly shareholder fight and a spurned takeover effort by rival Gannett Co.\par \par \uc2 All this while, the newspaper industry has suffered dramatic declines in print advertising and slow growth in digital ad revenue as readership has shifted online.\par \par \uc2 "We haven't really progressed to where we need to be," said Tronc Chief Executive Justin Dearborn. "Ross is pretty unique in the market, and he has background and history of executing digital transformations."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Levinsohn also served as CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media for a period after his term at \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 , where he was succeeded by \uc2 Marissa Mayer\uc2  in 2012. While working for News Corp.'s Fox digital properties in the early 2000s, he oversaw the acquisition of Myspace and helped create the company that is now \uc2 Hulu\uc2 . (Since then, \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2  split with News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, in 2013.)\par \par \uc2 In a statement, \uc2 Tronc\uc2  said Mr. Levinsohn will be tasked with expanding the Times' global footprint, content initiatives and revenue opportunities, among other things.\par \par \uc2 Tronc\uc2 , which had previously been known as \uc2 Tribune Publishing Co\uc2 . until June 2016, has pushed hard toward reinventing itself as a digitally-focused media company, but has struggled to find its footing amid dramatic changes to the media landscape online.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, the company reported a 9% drop in digital ad revenue in the second quarter from a year earlier. It has boosted its digital-only subscriber totals across its titles to 220,000, but remains far behind big publishers like the New York Times and the Journal.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the company has battled through a period of turbulent management since being spun off in 2014 from TV assets now called \uc2 Tribune Media Co\uc2 . In early 2016, it brought in investor \uc2 Michael Ferro\uc2  to help shore up its books, but he quickly orchestrated a management takeover, forcing out its CEO and much of its board.\par \par \uc2 He then fended off the takeover effort by Gannett, in part, by bringing in billionaire biotech entrepreneur, \uc2 Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong\uc2 , as an investor. The two have since engaged in a public shareholder battle for control.\par \par \uc2 Tronc\uc2  has tried to re-envision itself as "a content curation and monetization company" built around machine vision and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology to forge a path into a digital future\u8212\'20\'14efforts that have faced criticism both within and outside the company.\par \par \uc2 Write to Lukas I.

The tricky problem of constructing powerful batteries capable of being charged and recharged has driven several other battery makers, such as \uc2 Aquion Energy Inc\uc2 . and A123 Systems LLC, into bankruptcy. Alevo had aimed to sell the batteries to utilities and grid operators that buy power from renewable sources.\par \par \uc2 "The chapter 11 filings are a difficult but necessary decision," said Peter Heintzelman, who was appointed as Alevo's chief financial officer in January. "It is a sad day for our dedicated employees and partners, as well as for the promise of Alevo's technology."\par \par \uc2 The debtors represent the U.S. operations of \uc2 Alevo Group\uc2 , a Swiss-based conglomerate connected to Russian billionaire oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev. He gained notoriety in the U.S. in 2008 for{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121388918602688761"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  buying Donald Trump's Palm Beach, Fla. mansion}}}\uc2  for $95 million.\par \par \uc2 The company said it encountered "significant production challenges" that sapped revenue, while new sources of funding failed to materialize quickly enough to allow its operations to continue. Alevo listed assets of between $1 million and $10 million in the chapter 11 petitions and up to $50 million in debt.\par \par \uc2 At 40 feet long, the company's batteries resemble shipping containers. Alevo had promised to bring 200 new jobs to its facility, located inside a former Philip Morris manufacturing plant, with help from North Carolina economic development officials. It said it would pump $250 million into the plant to create a global energy storage business, complete with grid data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  offerings. North Carolina had agreed to reimburse some of Alevo's costs, on the condition that the plant turned revenue-positive for the state treasury.\par \par \uc2 Judge Catharine Aron of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Greensboro, N.C., has been assigned the bankruptcy case, numbered 17-50877.\par \par \uc2 Write to Andrew Scurria at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROBK20170821ed8l000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Nearly 30 years later, despite rule changes, the prospect of another such crisis continues to spook regulators and market participants alike.\par \par \uc2 In particular, the crash\u8212\'20\'14and the ensuing liquidity crunch\u8212\'20\'14raised questions about the effectiveness of clearinghouses in a crisis situation, and about which entities need to step in as a backstop if a clearinghouse is on the brink of failure.\par \par \uc2 Clearinghouses act as intermediaries between two parties in a derivatives transaction, guaranteeing payment if either side reneges. Member firms\u8212\'20\'14banks and brokers\u8212\'20\'14have to deposit collateral, or margin, that the clearinghouse can tap if a trade goes sour. The failure of a clearinghouse could tie up billions of dollars in collateral, carrying huge implications for the financial system.\par \par \uc2 Three years after the 1987 panic, Ben Bernanke, then a Princeton University economics professor, dissected the role of clearinghouses in crisis situations. "The smooth operation of the financial market clearing and settlement system is based at all times on the presumption that the banking system is sound and can satisfy demands for withdrawal of funds," wrote the future Federal Reserve chairman.\par \par \uc2 During the 1987 crisis, clearinghouses dealt with several sources of stress, including interruptions in the flow of funds and payment problems. The clearinghouses issued more than $4 billion in variation margin calls, requiring member firms to kick in additional funds.\par \par \uc2 In retrospect, clearinghouses were criticized for making the margin calls, because the move drained liquidity from the system at a moment of extreme stress.\par \par \uc2 The Fed, under Mr. Bernanke's predecessor Alan Greenspan, stepped in on Oct. 20, 1987, affirming its "readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the financial and economic system." Though some have criticized Mr. Greenspan's response, arguing that the Fed's role as the ultimate backstop introduced moral hazard into the financial system, the statement worked. Banks were persuaded to lend freely, knowing that the Fed would back them up if they encountered difficulties. As anyone familiar with the 2008 financial crisis knows, Mr. Bernanke learned quite a bit from this episode.\par \par \uc2 Clearing practices are much more advanced now than they were in 1987. Far more derivatives are subject to clearing, and clearinghouses are cognizant of their role as financial utilities, running stress tests to ensure they could survive the failure of multiple counterparties (read: big banks).\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, in a total financial meltdown, questions remain about what would happen to clearinghouses in trouble and who would step in to guarantee liquidity.\par \par \uc2 At a House Agriculture Committee hearing this summer, Rep. Tom O'Halleran (D., Ariz.), a former member of the \uc2 Chicago Board of Trade\uc2  board of directors, nodded to the crucial role of the central bank.\par \par \uc2 While clearinghouses have a method of resolving market stress, it can create liquidity crunches. The final backstop is the "the type of liquidity that only, I believe, the Federal Reserve can produce," Mr. O'Halleran said. "I just can't envision a marketplace in which we have to identify that the Federal Reserve is not the backstop to this whole process," he added.\par \par \uc2 That position is controversial among conservatives who view a Fed backstop as moral hazard that corrupts the proper functioning of markets. But the fact remains that in a financial crisis, liquidity has to come from somewhere, or be guaranteed by some entity. Messrs. Bernanke and Greenspan made clear, in crises 20 years apart, that the Fed must be the entity to play that role.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Analysis: New Audit Rule Could Bring Sunshine to U.S. Markets\par \par \uc2 By Jason Zweig\par \par \uc2 With luck, it may soon become a little harder for companies to keep investors in the dark.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  is considering whether to adopt a rule proposed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board that would require companies' annual reports to include information about some of the most important issues raised by accountants in the annual audit.\par \par \uc2 Similar rules are already in force in the United Kingdom and Europe and other parts of the world; all told, 124 countries have adopted or are adopting those standards, says Matt Waldron, technical director at the \uc2 International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board\uc2 , a global accounting organization based in New York.\par \par \uc2 Should the U.S. join them?\par \par \uc2 Corporate audits have long been conducted in a kind of twilight. An independent accounting firm confidentially pores over a company's books and records and other aspects of the business, and then gives a terse thumbs-up or thumbs-down in the company's annual report.\par \par \uc2 A thumbs-up states that the accounting firm obtained "reasonable assurance" that the financial statements are "free of material misstatement" and represent the company's condition "fairly." A thumbs-down casts doubt on whether the company can "continue as a going concern."\par \par \uc2 That's it. These certifications \u8212\'20\'14 a handful of paragraphs typically indistinguishable from one company to another \u8212\'20\'14 offer no further information for investors.\par \par \uc2 The new rules would make auditors describe any significant issues they raised with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. The auditors will have to explain any "challenging, subjective or complex" judgments.\par \par \uc2 Auditors in other countries are already disclosing the areas where they have challenged management's assumptions and where estimates are conservative or optimistic.\par \par \uc2 So companies whose shares trade both overseas and in the U.S. may have the same auditor but two drastically different reporting formats.\par \par \uc2 The 2016 U.S. annual report for \uc2 Aegon N.V\uc2 ., the Dutch insurer and asset manager, has a cookie-cutter communiqu\u233\'00\'E9 of less than 650 words; the international version is more than seven times as long and delves into the potential risks of specific assets and transactions. (Both were prepared by the Amsterdam affiliate of \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 After years of negotiating, the biggest accounting firms have been generally supportive of the new rules in their recent comments on the rule.\par \par \uc2 Some companies have argued that the rule could prompt their audit firm to disclose sensitive information about them that could be exploited by competitors. "I find that argument bizarre," says Linda de Beer, an accountant and corporate director in South Africa who helped develop the international standards. "All investors are asking auditors for is, \u8216\'20\'18We want to see a little of the detail, through your eyes, of what you drove deeper on.' That doesn't involve giving away any competitive edge."\par \par \uc2 Would accountants be sued more often if they spelled out the reasoning behind their analysis? Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant at the SEC, thinks the opposite: "The obligation to come clean on critical items in the report means that auditors will have more ability to push back on management."\par \par \uc2 That won't prevent notorious frauds like Enron or WorldCom, but it might make them at least slightly less likely.\par \par \uc2 In surveys by the \uc2 CFA Institute\uc2 , a nonprofit group of financial analysts, investors have consistently supported the concept of adding more detail to the auditor's report. The existing format is "antiquated," says Kurt Schacht, a managing director there. "Shareholders ought to get more information considering that they pay for these opinions."\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the PCAOB declined to comment, citing the board's policy not to discuss rules while the SEC is soliciting input from the public. The SEC also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Through Friday, you can express your own opinion on the rule at sec.gov/rules/pcaob.htm; the SEC is likely to move on it by the end of October.\par \par \uc2 When future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, in 1913, that "sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants," he couldn't have known how long it would take to part the clouds.\par \par \uc2 Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange weren't required to have their financial statements prepared by independent auditors until 1933. In 1939, the SEC's chief accountant argued that the auditor's report should itemize "any permissible exceptions or limitations" in a company's financial statements, along with any "unusual and significant features of the audit" \u8212\'20\'14 exactly in the spirit of the rule the SEC is only now considering.\par \par \uc2 A 1963 study by the SEC found that more than a quarter of all companies whose stocks traded over-the-counter "did not disseminate any financial information to shareholders at all," and 23% of their reports weren't even certified by the auditors.\par \par \uc2 Under the proposed rule, annual reports, already bulky, will get even fatter. But it will provide valuable information for investors, and it's a welcome step on the long, slow path toward more transparency.\par \par \uc2 Trump and the CEOs: Behind the Collapse of an Uneasy Alliance\par \par \uc2 By Vanessa Fuhrmans, Joann S. Lublin and Emily Glazer\par \par \uc2 Can this relationship be saved?\par \par \uc2 Few chief executives openly supported candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Yet by the time of his inauguration, many were expressing cautious optimism they could work with a president who presented himself as a leader with business acumen.\par \par \uc2 Many of Mr. Trump's stated priorities\u8212\'20\'14lighter regulation and a tax overhaul \u8212\'20\'14are supported by corporate leaders. Comforting some executives, Mr. Trump appointed several CEOs to his cabinet, such as \uc2 Exxon Mobil Corp\uc2 .'s \uc2 Rex Tillerson\uc2  and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone wanted to support the president in making the country and its economy better," said Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a group that represents major Wall Street firms and U.S. companies, and who led a CEO delegation to the White House earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Last week saw a parade of top executives distancing themselves from the president, in some cases sharply, in response to his comments about racial violence in Charlottesville, Va. Once executives started quitting the president's advisory councils, the groups disbanded, a rare instance of companies putting themselves squarely, albeit unwillingly, into the political sphere.\par \par \uc2 "The social issues became too difficult to navigate," said Ms. Wylde.\par \par \uc2 Charlottesville was the tipping point, not the cause. Behind the scenes, some executives say, ties had been growing strained for months.\par \par \uc2 Then-\uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . CEO \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2 , initially a supporter of Silicon Valley engaging the president, was the first to quit a White House council in early February, following employee pressure and a social-media backlash relating to Uber's response to the president's proposed travel ban.\par \par \uc2 David Crane, former CEO of power company NRG Energy Inc., and now senior operating executive at \uc2 Pegasus Capital Advisors\uc2 , said the president's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords, despite intensive industry lobbying, "was seen as a slap in the face by many executives."\par \par \uc2 From the beginning, many were uneasy about Mr. Trump's habit of calling companies out by name on his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account\u8212\'20\'14even when he was praising them.\par \par \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . executives chose to bite their tongues when in July the president incorrectly portrayed the company's plans to build plants in the U.S. Similarly, Merck & Co. chief Kenneth Frazier and Walt Disney Co. CEO \uc2 Robert Iger\uc2  chose to overlook issues where they and the White House differed so they could have a voice in deliberations, according to industry executives and Mr. Iger's own comments.\par \par \uc2 "We have always believed that dialogue is critical to progress; that is why I joined the President's Forum," International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty wrote to employees last week, noting that \uc2 IBM\uc2  had worked with every U.S. president since Woodrow Wilson. "But this group can no longer serve the purpose for which it was formed." She added that \uc2 IBM\uc2  would continue to work with "all parts of the government" on policies it supports.\par \par \uc2 As early as February, the heads of two dozen manufacturers got a taste of the president's style. At a White House meeting to discuss job creation, Mr. Trump urged \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 .'s \uc2 Jeff Immelt\uc2  to share how the president hit a hole-in-one during a golf game they played together. At \uc2 GE\uc2 's next board meeting, directors ribbed Mr. Immelt for telling the story, according to a person familiar with \uc2 GE\uc2 . (Mr. Immelt stepped down as GE's CEO this month but remains chairman.)\par \par \uc2 By June, CEOs on the White House councils were already discussing whether to disband them, because of the time commitment and the increasing costs of a close association with the White House.\par \par \uc2 "It's not in the mandate of a company to enter politics, but CEOs are politicians, too," said Eric Dezenhall, a Washington-based crisis consultant who has helped companies respond to the Charlottesville events. "They have their own bases and constituencies of employees and consumers and shareholders that they also have to navigate."\par \par \uc2 The question now is whether Mr. Trump can win them back. During President Barack Obama's two terms, CEOs often felt like they were treated as bystanders, and some still hold out hope for joint action with the administration.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Burch\uc2 , president of Dayton, Ohio, trucking company \uc2 Jet Express Inc\uc2 ., said recent events shouldn't overshadow the pursuit of policy goals. His industry wants a seat at the table for many of the same reasons that attracted CEOs in the first place.\par \par \uc2 "The president's a business guy," he said. "We think infrastructure is something he can really get his arms around and get some movement."\par \par \uc2 Larry Kudlow, a commentator and informal economic adviser to Mr. Trump, who helped draft a campaign tax plan, said while CEOs are sensitive to social issues, they haven't broken from Trump policies particularly on deregulation and the tax code.\par \par \uc2 "This is going to blow over," he said. "I guarantee you that he will be on the phone with many of them."\par \par \uc2 The White House said the councils, a standard and often ineffective device used by administrations of all political stripes, had outlived their purpose. Trump aides said they retained open lines to business leaders. "We have an incredible amount of CEOs that want to give us their advice and guidance," one official said.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, given the anti-establishment tide that swept Mr. Trump into office, he may have received political benefit from taking a more antagonistic approach to America's large companies.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Trump announced his bid for the presidency, few prominent business figures, apart from venture capitalist \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2 , threw their support behind him. By the end of August 2016, not one CEO at the nation's 100 largest companies had donated to his campaign, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.\par \par \uc2 During the transition and the early days of the presidency, many felt a cautious optimism. \uc2 Stephen A. Schwarzman\uc2 , CEO of investment firm Blackstone Group, declared a new era for economic growth at January's \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  gathering in Davos, Switzerland.\par \par \uc2 At the same event, \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2  head \uc2 Rich Lesser\uc2  told the BBC: "I think people see an opportunity with a businessman as president, who is very committed to business and to growth, and potentially much less gridlock with the Republicans in control of Congress."\par \par \uc2 Declining to work with Mr. Trump also risked incurring his wrath on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Drug company executives such as Johnson & Johnson CEO \uc2 Alex Gorsky\uc2  and Merck's Mr. Frazier worried not engaging the president\u8212\'20\'14who had criticized drugmakers as "getting away with murder"\u8212\'20\'14might make it easier for his administration to give Medicare the power to negotiate and lower drug prices, according to industry officials.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut-based \uc2 United Technologies Corp\uc2 . had been targeted by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail over plans to ship jobs from its U.S.-based \uc2 Carrier Corp\uc2 . subsidiary to Mexico. The company and the president-elect later struck a deal after the election to keep some jobs in Indiana.\par \par \uc2 CEO \uc2 Gregory Hayes\uc2  appeared at the White House early on a rainy January morning for the president's first meeting with corporate chieftains. It was an inauspicious start. Mr. Hayes was left waiting outside the gate and eventually left. His name had been left off the list of invitees, according to people familiar with the incident.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's initial immigration ban, imposed days after his inauguration, posed the first major test. It was an issue some felt spoke directly to American values and also had a distinct business impact. Some tech companies had immigrant employees stranded outside the U.S. Employees at technology firms in particular were restive.\par \par \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . initially issued a neutral-sounding statement stressing the importance of immigration. A day later, it sharpened the tone, calling the policy a "fundamental step backwards." By early February, more than 130 mostly tech companies had joined legal action against the ban, which proposed temporarily barring travel from some Muslim-majority countries. The administration said the policy, which is now tied up in the courts, was needed to combat terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Executives on the president's strategic and policy forum were unhappy, but disbanding wasn't on the table, people familiar with the group's discussions said. Instead, members discussed whether to confront Mr. Trump about the policy during the group's first meeting in February. There, \uc2 Tesla Inc\uc2 .'s Elon Musk kicked off the criticism, which participants said Mr. Trump acknowledged.\par \par \uc2 Executives took heart that the president could be persuadable. At the same meeting, Mr. Trump asked J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief James Dimon to back his argument that China was a currency manipulator.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dimon disagreed, according to people familiar with the meeting.\par \par \uc2 "They're not, Mr. President," he said. "They're defending their currency." \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , the White House's economic adviser, and a few other members expressed similar views. Mr. Trump backed off the subject, and two months later, his administration chose not to tag China with the label of currency manipulator.\par \par \uc2 By late spring, business leaders were growing weary of having to publicly defend their participation with the White House.\par \par \uc2 Walt Disney CEO Mr. Iger, the target of online petitions with hundreds of thousands of signatures calling for him to withdraw from the business council, responded at a March shareholder meeting that his participation didn't mean he agreed with all Trump policies.\par \par \uc2 Quoting a song from the Broadway hit "Hamilton," he said remaining on the council gave him a chance to have a voice "in the room where it happens."\par \par \uc2 Others bit their tongues. When in a July interview Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Apple CEO \uc2 Tim Cook\uc2  had promised to build "three big plants, beautiful plants" in the U.S., \uc2 Apple\uc2  declined to comment publicly.\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. Trump had incorrectly portrayed \uc2 Apple\uc2 's U.S. plans, Mr. Cook didn't openly challenge the president because "it would have been a tweet war," according to a person familiar with the company.\par \par \uc2 Over the months, leaders brooded to their boards and families over whether they should take a stand against the president, according to leaders and corporate advisers.\par \par \uc2 "Informal conversations among board members often revolved around \u8216\'20\'18what do you tell your kids?' " said \uc2 Leslie A. Brun\uc2 , Merck's lead director and CEO of Sarr Group LLC, an investment holding company.\par \par \uc2 Some business leaders broke with Mr. Trump after the June decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\par \par \uc2 Dozens had publicly urged the president to stick with the climate deal, and several, including \uc2 Dow Chemical Co\uc2 . head \uc2 Andrew Liveris\uc2  and \uc2 Apple\uc2 's Mr. Cook made the case directly to the president that the treaty benefited job growth.\par \par \uc2 Within hours of Mr. Trump's decision, Mr. Iger and Mr. Musk quit the presidential council. Mr. Iger told only a few senior executives at \uc2 Disney\uc2  about his decision before announcing it in a tweet, according to a person close to the CEO.\par \par \uc2 By then, individual members of both main business advisory councils had been discussing disbanding them, given they had met only a few times, according to participants. The discussion picked up steam in July, when Mr. Trump moved to bar transgender people from serving in the military, they said.\par \par \uc2 More executives grew disenchanted after a group of tech-industry leaders saw few results at a White House meeting in June to brainstorm ways to modernize the government.\par \par \uc2 "It was becoming patently clear that these meetings were more of a time suck than a productive utilization of their time and resources," said a Washington-based consultant who works with CEOs involved on the councils.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, \uc2 IBM\uc2 's Ms. Rometty and \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2  head Mr. Lesser asked Mr. Schwarzman, the head of the strategy advisory council, about the future of the group and its effectiveness, given the pressure they were under from employees and the public, said people familiar with the group.\par \par \uc2 The unrest in Charlottesville, and the president's response, pushed even supporters to make a break.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday night, Merck's Mr. Frazier called Mr. Brun, the Merck lead director, to tell him that his conscience wouldn't permit him to stay on the manufacturing council, Mr. Brun said. Under Armour Inc.'s CEO Kevin Plank soon followed, along with \uc2 Intel Corp\uc2 .'s \uc2 Brian Krzanich\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Trump's Tuesday news conference, in which he apportioned blame equally between hate groups and people protesting them in Charlottesville, other executives said they had no choice but to go.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Ted Mann, Jonathan Rockoff, Andrew Tangel and Ben Fritz contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Why Lawsuits Targeting Stock Drops Are on the Rise\par \par \uc2 By Sara Randazzo\par \par \uc2 When pharmaceutical company \uc2 Depomed Inc\uc2 . DEPO 3.97% said this month it is fielding federal and state inquiries over its marketing of opioid painkillers, a stock drop was likely to follow.\par \par \uc2 But it was less expected, legal experts say, that shareholders would then sue the company for securities law violations, alleging that \uc2 Depomed\uc2  made false and misleading statements over a more than two-year period leading up to the Aug. 7 announcement in its earnings statement.\par \par \uc2 Depomed\uc2 , which is one of several pharmaceutical companies involved in the opioid probes, declined to comment Sunday.\par \par \uc2 The Friday lawsuit comes after 131 class-action securities suits were filed in federal court in the first six months of the year, a historic high, according to data from Cornerstone Research and the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.\par \par \uc2 The volume, which doesn't include suits challenging mergers and acquisitions, is higher than in any equivalent period since the Clearinghouse began tracking data in 1996, following the passage of landmark securities-litigation legislation. Under securities laws, investors can sue to recoup losses after a stock drops by proving a company or its employees fraudulently misstated or withheld information that would have been material to buying or selling shares.\par \par \uc2 "What's going on this year is absolutely without precedent," said Kevin LaCroix, an attorney who advises companies on directors and officers insurance.\par \par \uc2 Industry watchers say the rise is being driven by enterprising plaintiffs' firms bringing more, arguably weaker cases under the perceived strategy that companies will settle early to make a case go away. Advisers are alerting clients that in the current era, every company, from small-cap to corporate giants, needs a plan for defending against fraud accusations following investor losses.\par \par \uc2 "There's a reality of securities class-actions that needs to be baked in," said Douglas Greene, a securities defense lawyer at Lane Powell PC in Seattle.\par \par \uc2 Traditionally, the most lucrative cases for plaintiffs have hinged on misstatements within audited financials, which can come to light when a company announces plans to revise previously reported results.\par \par \uc2 But increasingly, smaller law firms are bringing securities cases targeting business disruptions or disasters, failed pharmaceutical trials and disappointing earnings. Such cases often settle for lower amounts and are more likely to be dismissed, data shows. But that hasn't stopped the flow.\par \par \uc2 At the current pace, 9.5% of the 4,411 U.S. exchange-listed companies will face a securities suit this year, including merger suits, according to Cornerstone\u8212\'20\'14the highest rate since 1997.\par \par \uc2 Researchers Jason Hegland and Michael Klausner at Stanford Securities Litigation \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  coined the term "emerging" law firm last year, positing that the firms are largely responsible for bringing what they call higher volumes of lower-quality cases.\par \par \uc2 The pair found the dismissal rate of cases brought by so-called emerging firms was 60% from 2012 to 2016, compared with 45% for established firms.\par \par \uc2 Their research found emerging firms\u8212\'20\'14which they identify primarily as \uc2 Pomerantz LLP\uc2 , the \uc2 Rosen Law Firm PA\uc2  and \uc2 Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14are more likely to pursue securities cases that aren't pegged to a financial misstatement.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers at the three firms say suing over smaller losses is just as valid a legal strategy and that smaller companies often have fewer safeguards in place, making them more susceptible to engaging in fraudulent activity. Laurence Rosen, managing partner of the Rosen firm, said the suggestion that "we take lots of bad cases with the hope of a few panning out is baseless conjecture."\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Lieberman\uc2 , co-managing partner of 80-year-old Pomerantz, said he agrees his firm and others have approached a broader range of cases in recent years, but he calls it a necessarily adaptation as the more obvious accounting misstatements have become scarcer.\par \par \uc2 "It's a new market, but securities laws apply just as well in this market," he said.\par \par \uc2 Nonfinancial cases used to account for less than half of nonmerger securities class actions, but have steadily risen, to 75% of those filed in 2016 and to 82% so far this year, Stanford Securities Litigation \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  data shows.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, that has included lawsuits claiming \uc2 Ocular Therapeutix Inc\uc2 . allegedly withheld manufacturing issues and that \uc2 Tableau Software Inc\uc2 . inadequately warned about increased competition. Tableau said the case has no merit. Ocular didn't respond to a request for comment. Shareholders also sued \uc2 Anadarko Petroleum Corp\uc2 . after the oil-and-gas company temporarily shut down 3,000 wells following an explosion in Colorado. The suit claims the company didn't warn investors of safety concerns.\par \par \uc2 In a court filing, Anadarko called the case an "event-driven complaint" and said the tragedy doesn't give rise to a securities claim.\par \par \uc2 Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, plaintiffs' firms primarily earn lead counsel appointments by representing the investor with the largest loss. That's led more established players like \uc2 Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP\uc2 ; \uc2 Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP\uc2 ; and Grant & Eisenhofer PA, to build deep connections with pension funds and other institutional investors to position themselves to be named lead-counsel.\par \par \uc2 The smaller firms, meanwhile, have had to create niches with individual, rather than institutional, investors. More than a decade ago, that meant filing stock-options backdating cases and, later, suits against Chinese companies that did reverse mergers in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Now, with those cases dried up, smaller firms look for outward signs of trouble to latch onto, like an auditor resigning, a short-seller report, or a government investigation, analysts and defense attorneys say.\par \par \uc2 Since 2013, individual investors have been named lead plaintiff more than institutional investors, according to Cornerstone, further indication of the rise of the smaller suit.\par \par \uc2 Emerging firms are more likely to settle cases early and for less money, Messrs. Hegland and Klausner found.\par \par \uc2 The median settlement size for emerging firms is $2.6 million in the early pleading stage, and $3.1 million once a case reaches discovery.

Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . traders at the center of the 2012 "London Whale" saga, ending the last U.S. case against traders involved in a debacle that cost the New York bank more than $6 billion.\par \par \uc2 The decision by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , disclosed in a court filing Friday, follows a similar move in July by U.S. prosecutors to drop criminal charges against the same ex-employees, Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout.\par \par \uc2 The former traders were accused of hiding the losses as they mounted inside a London outpost of \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 . The government cases relied on a key witness, Bruno Iksil, who worked alongside Messrs. Martin-Artajo and Grout. Mr. Iksil, nicknamed the "London Whale" for his outsize bets, agreed in 2013 to testify against his former co-workers for their then-alleged roles in hiding the losses.\par \par \uc2 The one-paragraph filing Friday from the SEC doesn't disclose the reason for the dismissal. But people familiar with the case said the move reflected concerns about Mr. Iksil, who in recent public statements and deposition testimony stated the defendants hadn't engaged in mismarking and had acted with assent from senior management. That potentially contradicted the government's theory of the case, these people said.\par \par \uc2 The criminal case collapsed in July for similar reasons. On July 21, prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office said the government "no longer believes that it can rely on the testimony of Iksil in prosecuting this case" after a "review of recent writings and statements made by Iksil."\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Messrs. Martin-Artajo and Grout welcomed the decision to drop the civil and criminal cases. "At the end of the day there was no evidence against him that justified the charges," said Edward Little, a lawyer for Mr. Grout. Bill Leone, a lawyer for Mr. Martin-Artajo, said his client was "grateful," adding: "This was not an unfair or an unjust result."\par \par \uc2 The U.S. Attorney's Office also cited extradition challenges in its decision to drop the criminal charges: Mr. Martin-Artajo is a Spanish citizen, Mr. Grout is a French citizen, and neither appeared in the U.S. to face the charges.\par \par \uc2 Because of the extradition issue, the SEC was allowed to move forward with civil proceedings before the criminal case against Messrs. Martin-Artajo and Grout was resolved\u8212\'20\'14an unusual sequence of events that allowed for extensive discovery in the civil matter, including depositions of witnesses. U.S. prosecutors asked the court overseeing the SEC case in 2015 to take "any available measures to prevent the defendants from using the civil discovery process to circumvent the criminal process while they remain fugitives from justice in the criminal case."\par \par \uc2 It was during discovery that Mr. Iksil's changing account emerged. In a February hearing in the SEC matter, Mr. Little told the court that they had learned of a 400-page memoir by Mr. Iksil that appeared to contradict the government's case. Mr. Iksil had also published some of his claims online.\par \par \uc2 "If I had to point to one thing that helped us prove our client's innocence, it was our ability to gather information in the civil case," Mr. Leone said. The lawyers presented the information gathered in the process to civil and criminal authorities, he said. "The amount of discovery that was permitted by this case was very unusual, and it was much appreciated."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Gregory Zuckerman contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Unit of \uc2 Intesa Sanpaolo\uc2  Agrees to Pay $35 Million Over Mishandling ADRs\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A U.S. subsidiary of Italian bank \uc2 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA\uc2  has agreed to pay $35 million to settle claims that it improperly obtained and lent foreign shares to clients, marking the second time regulators have penalized a broker-dealer based on a wide-ranging probe of the market.\par \par \uc2 Banca IMI Securities Corp\uc2 . provided American depositary receipts\u8212\'20\'14certificates representing ownership of a foreign stock\u8212\'20\'14to clients without ensuring they would be backed by the actual shares, the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  said Friday.

The new rule, approved in June by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, would require auditors to tell investors about the key areas of concern they encounter when performing a company's audit. But the group letter says the rule would be "detrimental to public companies" in several ways, including raising audit costs, creating liability for companies and auditors, and setting "problematic" standards for what kind of information will be considered to be material.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Ten years ago this week, the then chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs complained to the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  that his bank had been \u8220\'20\'1Cseeing things that were 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row\u8221\'20\'1D. He was using this to explain the sudden losses of about a third that Goldman\u8217\'20\'19s quantitative funds had suffered in the previous week, in an event that soon came to be labelled the Quant Quake.\par \par \uc2 That provoked an amused response from statistics professors. Whole academic papers have been devoted to working out exactly how unusual even one 25-standard deviation move might be. As far as I can ascertain, it seems to be accepted that even if there had been trading every day since the Big Bang initiated the universe, it is unlikely that even one 25-standard deviation event would have occurred.\par \par \uc2 For another illustration, note that the chance of winning the UK National Lottery that week was 0.00000004. A 25-standard deviation event would involve winning it 21 or 22 times in a row. Yet such improbable events had happened to Goldman \u8220\'20\'1Cseveral days in a row\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2007/08/14/6553/goldman-this-is-not-a-rescue-so-what-is-it-then/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 David Viniar }}}\uc2 , Goldman\u8217\'20\'19s greatly respected CFO of the time, was talking nonsense. But it was revealing nonsense, a quantitative Freudian slip. What he was saying, in the language of statistics, was that according to his models the event had not just happened. But it had happened, and so he should have realised that his model was wrong \u8212\'20\'14 but could not bring himself to do so.\par \par \uc2 This was one of the most telling episodes of hubris from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/global-financial-crisis"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 financial crisis }}}\uc2 . Everyone left realising that quant models were not the guaranteed market-beaters they had assumed, and that market behaviour could not be modelled with precision. Quant funds operating value and momentum strategies were plainly destined to go the same way as the CDOs Squared, and the other detritus of the crisis.\par \par \uc2 But that did not happen. Barely a month later, Goldman announced that it had made a $300m profit on the money it poured into its quant funds to stop the bleeding.\par \par \uc2 And now, a slightly repackaged version of those quant strategies that blew up and then re-righted themselves, has become one of the dominant products that the investment industry sells to customers. So-called Smart Beta exchange traded funds have $592bn in assets globally, according to ETFGI, and have grown at more than 20 per cent per year since the crisis.\par \par \uc2 Let us re-examine what happened a decade ago. Several large funds used algorithms to identify stocks that had particular factors that made them likely to under- or outperform. The most common by far are value \u8212\'20\'14 cheap stocks \u8212\'20\'14 and momentum \u8212\'20\'14 stocks that are already going up. They would hold the stocks that looked best according to these factors and borrow and then sell, so as to bet against, or short, those that looked worst. As the differences in performance were often tiny, they used large amounts of borrowed money, or leverage, to make this worth their while.\par \par \uc2 The strategies worked well until, in the chaotic early days of the credit crisis, someone somewhere pulled their money from a quant fund. To meet the redemption, that fund had to sell its long stocks (causing them to fall) and buy back its short stocks (causing them to rise). This meant sudden losses for other funds investing using the same factors.\par \par \uc2 And so losses cascaded throughout the quant community. In a week when the market as a whole was roughly flat, Goldman\u8217\'20\'19s main quantitative vehicle lost a third of its value. It puts this week\u8217\'20\'19s renewed dose of mild volatility into some perspective.\par \par \uc2 The quant models had not incorporated the risk that many different players, following the same factors, would choose to take positions in the same stocks \u8212\'20\'14 crowding, in the jargon. So they were confronted with a situation they had thought impossible. Once everyone is wise to the same idea or factor, it must logically grow that much harder to profit from it.\par \par \uc2 A decade on, several lessons have been learned. Risk management is considered more important, and is even regarded as a source of advantage.\par \par \uc2 Quant strategies often now come in handy \u8220\'20\'1Csmart beta\u8221\'20\'1D form, in ETFs to keep costs down. They do not sell short or use leverage, while the big quant hedge funds use far less borrowing than they did 10 years ago. The risk of cascading losses is reduced.\par \par \uc2 There is also an arms race to come up with new factors, sometimes using \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  rather than market or corporate factors. Many tend to lose their efficacy once academics have published them \u8212\'20\'14 professional investors now know to read the academic literature and jump on any market anomaly that the professors find. This means the anomalies may not last long.\par \par \uc2 A study by the academics Jeffrey Pontiff and David McLean road-tested 96 separate factors identified in the literature over the past decade. It found that extra returns, compared to the market, dropped by 26 per cent between completion of the research and publication, and by 58 per cent thereafter. Typically, the academics had found a real factor, but it dwindled rapidly once it was exposed.\par \par \uc2 Away from this arms race, simple \u8220\'20\'1Cvalue\u8221\'20\'1D ETFs give a good chance to avoid the worst of any coming equity drawdown by investing in the cheapest stocks. It is a sensible strategy\par \par \uc2 But some problems still remain. The risk of overcrowding will not go away, particularly if a factor begins to work very well. And \u8220\'20\'1Ctail risk\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 of a really spectacular loss \u8212\'20\'14 has not gone away. Value is stunningly successful in the very long term, but has performed badly almost uninterruptedly since the crisis. A smart beta fund gives you a slightly better chance of doing slightly better than the index. But it can still do badly for a long time.\par \par \uc2 And we can all now agree that your chances of losing a lot of money in smart beta or quant funds are, alas, very much greater than your chances of winning the lottery 22 times in a row.\par \par \uc2 john.authers@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170818ed8i003bh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Ten years ago this week, the then chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs complained to the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  that his bank had been \u8220\'20\'1Cseeing things that were 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row\u8221\'20\'1D. He was using this to explain the sudden losses of about a third that Goldman\u8217\'20\'19s quantitative funds had suffered in the previous week, in an event that soon came to be labelled the Quant Quake.\par \par \uc2 That provoked an amused response from statistics professors. Whole academic papers have been devoted to working out exactly how unusual even one 25-standard deviation move might be. As far as I can ascertain, it seems to be accepted that even if there had been trading every day since the Big Bang initiated the universe, it is unlikely that even one 25-standard deviation event would have occurred.\par \par \uc2 For another illustration, note that the chance of winning the UK National Lottery that week was 0.00000004. A 25-standard deviation event would involve winning it 21 or 22 times in a row. Yet such improbable events had happened to Goldman \u8220\'20\'1Cseveral days in a row\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2007/08/14/6553/goldman-this-is-not-a-rescue-so-what-is-it-then/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 David Viniar}}}\uc2 , Goldman\u8217\'20\'19s greatly respected CFO of the time, was talking nonsense. But it was revealing nonsense, a quantitative Freudian slip. What he was saying, in the language of statistics, was that according to his models the event had not just happened. But it had happened, and so he should have realised that his model was wrong \u8212\'20\'14 but could not bring himself to do so.\par \par \uc2 This was one of the most telling episodes of hubris from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/global-financial-crisis"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 financial crisis}}}\uc2 . Everyone left realising that quant models were not the guaranteed market-beaters they had assumed, and that market behaviour could not be modelled with precision. Quant funds operating value and momentum strategies were plainly destined to go the same way as the CDOs Squared, and the other detritus of the crisis.\par \par \uc2 But that did not happen. Barely a month later, Goldman announced that it had made a $300m profit on the money it poured into its quant funds to stop the bleeding.\par \par \uc2 And now, a slightly repackaged version of those quant strategies that blew up and then re-righted themselves, has become one of the dominant products that the investment industry sells to customers. So-called Smart Beta exchange traded funds have $592bn in assets globally, according to ETFGI, and have grown at more than 20 per cent per year since the crisis.\par \par \uc2 Let us re-examine what happened a decade ago. Several large funds used algorithms to identify stocks that had particular factors that made them likely to under- or outperform. The most common by far are value \u8212\'20\'14 cheap stocks \u8212\'20\'14 and momentum \u8212\'20\'14 stocks that are already going up. They would hold the stocks that looked best according to these factors and borrow and then sell, so as to bet against, or short, those that looked worst. As the differences in performance were often tiny, they used large amounts of borrowed money, or leverage, to make this worth their while.\par \par \uc2 The strategies worked well until, in the chaotic early days of the credit crisis, someone somewhere pulled their money from a quant fund. To meet the redemption, that fund had to sell its long stocks (causing them to fall) and buy back its short stocks (causing them to rise). This meant sudden losses for other funds investing using the same factors.\par \par \uc2 And so losses cascaded throughout the quant community. In a week when the market as a whole was roughly flat, Goldman\u8217\'20\'19s main quantitative vehicle lost a third of its value. It puts this week\u8217\'20\'19s renewed dose of mild volatility into some perspective.\par \par \uc2 The quant models had not incorporated the risk that many different players, following the same factors, would choose to take positions in the same stocks \u8212\'20\'14 crowding, in the jargon. So they were confronted with a situation they had thought impossible. Once everyone is wise to the same idea or factor, it must logically grow that much harder to profit from it.\par \par \uc2 A decade on, several lessons have been learned. Risk management is considered more important, and is even regarded as a source of advantage.\par \par \uc2 Quant strategies often now come in handy \u8220\'20\'1Csmart beta\u8221\'20\'1D form, in ETFs to keep costs down. They do not sell short or use leverage, while the big quant hedge funds use far less borrowing than they did 10 years ago. The risk of cascading losses is reduced.\par \par \uc2 There is also an arms race to come up with new factors, sometimes using \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  rather than market or corporate factors. Many tend to lose their efficacy once academics have published them \u8212\'20\'14 professional investors now know to read the academic literature and jump on any market anomaly that the professors find. This means the anomalies may not last long.\par \par \uc2 A study by the academics Jeffrey Pontiff and David McLean road-tested 96 separate factors identified in the literature over the past decade. It found that extra returns, compared to the market, dropped by 26 per cent between completion of the research and publication, and by 58 per cent thereafter. Typically, the academics had found a real factor, but it dwindled rapidly once it was exposed.\par \par \uc2 Away from this arms race, simple \u8220\'20\'1Cvalue\u8221\'20\'1D ETFs give a good chance to avoid the worst of any coming equity drawdown by investing in the cheapest stocks. It is a sensible strategy\par \par \uc2 But some problems still remain. The risk of overcrowding will not go away, particularly if a factor begins to work very well. And \u8220\'20\'1Ctail risk\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 of a really spectacular loss \u8212\'20\'14 has not gone away. Value is stunningly successful in the very long term, but has performed badly almost uninterruptedly since the crisis. A smart beta fund gives you a slightly better chance of doing slightly better than the index. But it can still do badly for a long time.\par \par \uc2 And we can all now agree that your chances of losing a lot of money in smart beta or quant funds are, alas, very much greater than your chances of winning the lottery 22 times in a row.\par \par \uc2 john.authers@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020170818ed8i003h1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The central bank still expects a lot of them: namely to focus on big-picture risk oversight rather than spending time on regulatory minutiae, which can be left to the bank's management.\par \par \uc2 The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-aims-to-go-easier-on-bank-directors-1501781762"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Fed's proposal earlier this month}}}\uc2  was partly meant to bring relief to bank boards faced with myriad postcrisis regulations that critics say caused directors to act more like top bank executives. The central bank is now taking comments on its proposal, which clarifies requirements for bank boards rather than removes them. Comments are due by Oct. 10.\par \par \uc2 The guidance "is focusing on what the expectations are and should be for bank directors, not lowering the standards," said William Lang, managing director at Promontory Financial Group who previously led the supervision of banking organizations at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fed governor Jerome Powell told The Wall Street Journal when the proposal was announced that expectations for bank boards remained "very high." The Fed's plan "is not at all to lighten the workload of directors or make their life easier," Mr. Powell said. "It is an attempt to get them out of the weeds and put them focusing on the big issues."\par \par \uc2 The Fed is seeking input on how it should assess the effectiveness of a board in terms of overseeing the bank's operations and management. It also asks which bank regulations should be eliminated or revised, a move that many bankers say indicates regulators' willingness to roll back some postcrisis rules.\par \par \uc2 "While we're continuing to review the proposal, we appreciate that the Fed appears to have taken a positive step toward restoring balance to the duties of bank boards," said Jeff Sigmund, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association.\par \par \uc2 The Fed and other bank regulators tightened oversight of bank boards after the 2008 crisis by issuing requirements to hold board members more accountable for overseeing bank management. Bankers and regulators alike say the requirements went too far. The Fed began reviewing its expectations for boards as early as 2014, looking at requirements issued before and after the crisis.\par \par \uc2 On the same day it announced the bank-boards move, the Fed issued another proposal that changes the way it rates big banks' risk management. Part of that includes evaluating the effectiveness of bank boards.\par \par \uc2 Other regulators have their own rules for bank directors. The \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , the regulator of national banks, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulator-sets-risk-management-standards-for-banks-1409682187"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 issued a set of "heightened expectations" in 2014}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It's unclear whether interim Comptroller \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , tapped by President Donald Trump in May, will seek to scale back some of the requirements on boards as part of a broader deregulation effort. The OCC has already {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banking-regulator-takes-first-step-toward-changing-volcker-rule-1501683091"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 asked for public feedback on potential changes to the Volcker rule}}}\uc2  preventing banks from trading for their own account, the first regulator to take a step in revamping the rule.\par \par \uc2 But many observers say the heavier responsibility placed on bank boards in recent years will stay in place. "The expectations, particularly for large banks, are still going to be quite high," Mr. Lang said.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors Allege Insider Trading Involving Former Bank of America IT Worker\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A former \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 . employee and several friends at prominent Wall Street firms face criminal insider-trading charges over tips about potential mergers gleaned from a confidential deals database.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors unveiled charges against seven people, including Daniel Rivas, a former information technology consultant at Bank of America. Mr. Rivas is alleged to have passed on information from the database to friends, including his girlfriend's father, James Moodhe, according to an indictment made public Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The group that traded on the information earned over $5 million by trading in more than two dozen stocks, including shares of \uc2 Monsanto Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Cabela's Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 ADT Corp\uc2 ., according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rivas and Mr. Moodhe pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court last week, according to prosecutors who announced the pleas on Wednesday. A spokesman for Bank of America said Mr. Rivas was fired in April and that the bank cooperated fully with the government probes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Moodhe, a former treasurer and assistant controller at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon Financial Services LLC, reaped more than $2 million in profits by using Mr. Rivas's tips to trade stocks and options of at least 25 companies, according to the indictment. A spokesman for TP ICAP, Tullett Prebon's parent company, confirmed that Mr. Moodhe worked there until May. The company declined to comment on the claims against him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rivas, 32 years old, passed the first tip, about the pending purchase of \uc2 Covance Inc\uc2 ., to Mr. Moodhe in October 2014 after he started dating Mr. Moodhe's daughter, according to a separate civil lawsuit filed Wednesday against Mr. Rivas and the six traders by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . Soon after receiving the information, Mr. Moodhe bought 1,000 Covance shares for a cost of about $80,000, according to the complaint. About a week later, he unloaded the shares for a $19,000 profit on the day the deal was announced, according to the SEC.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rivas later moved in with Mr. Moodhe's daughter in a house in New Jersey, prosecutors said. As more tips came from Mr. Rivas, Mr. Moodhe started placing more aggressive trades in call options that pay off if a stock rises above a target price, according to the SEC's complaint.\par \par \uc2 An attorney for Mr. Rivas didn't return a call seeking comment, and a lawyer for Mr. Moodhe declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Moodhe, 60 years old, also passed some of the information to Michael Siva, a longtime friend who worked as a broker at Morgan Stanley in New Jersey, according to the SEC complaint and records from the \uc2 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The two men used code phrases to share tips over the phone and met at diners where Mr. Moodhe "read from pieces of paper provided to him by Rivas, which contained detailed information about confidential impending deals," according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  confirmed that Mr. Siva has worked at the brokerage firm and said he has been placed on administrative leave.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Siva, 55 years old, used the information to make trades that earned $880,000 for his clients, according to the SEC. In one case, Mr. Moodhe phoned Mr. Siva the day after he received information from Mr. Rivas about \uc2 Apollo Global Management LLC\uc2 's $6.93 billion acquisition of \uc2 ADT Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Siva purchased 2,100 shares of ADT stock for clients on Feb. 10 and 11, 2016, at about $27 a share, according to the SEC. A week later, the deal was announced at a price of $42 a share, generating profits of $26,400, the SEC said. Mr. Siva couldn't immediately be reached for comment, and law-enforcement officials didn't disclose an attorney for him.\par \par \uc2 The SEC sued all three men as well as four others who allegedly traded on information that came from Mr. Rivas.\par \par \uc2 The SEC and prosecutors said Mr. Rivas shared tips with two of the men, Roberto Rodriguez and Rodolfo Sablon, using an encrypted, mobile messaging app that uses a timer to destroy messages. An attorney for Mr. Rodriguez said his client posted a $250,000 bond Wednesday and was released. Mr. Sablon couldn't be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rivas also shared tips with another close friend from his childhood in New York City, according to prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 "The tippers and traders in this case are alleged to have used various methods to try to cover their tracks, but their efforts failed," said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division. "These charges reflect our continued use of sophisticated tools to detect and root out secretive and wide-reaching insider trading schemes."\par \par \uc2 After his termination from \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 , Mr. Rivas was hired by \uc2 RBC Capital Markets\uc2 , the investment banking arm of the \uc2 Royal Bank of Canada\uc2 . The Canadian bank was unaware of the investigations when it hired him in June and its background check didn't reveal the allegations, said a person familiar with the matter. The bank suspended him on Wednesday after finding out about the charges, the person said.\par \par \uc2 A bank spokeswoman said all of the alleged misconduct occurred before Mr. Rivas joined RBC.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Michael Rapoport and Vipal Monga contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 China's Pyramid-Scheme Crackdown Reopens Debate on Multilevel Marketing\par \par \uc2 HONG KONG\u8212\'20\'14A Chinese crackdown on pyramid schemes has reopened an old debate about U.S. multilevel marketing firms like \uc2 Herbalife Ltd\uc2 ., which conduct a significant amount of business there.\par \par \uc2 Chinese regulators said they are embarking this week on a three-month national campaign targeted at pyramid schemes\u8212\'20\'14literally "chain selling" in Chinese. These are organizations that profit off the recruitment of salespeople, rather than through the sales of products themselves.\par \par \uc2 The campaign aims to "resolutely eradicate all kinds of chain-selling organizations that trick job seekers to join through fraudulent postings," according to a statement posted earlier this week on the \uc2 State Administration for Industry and Commerce\uc2 's website.\par \par \uc2 The campaign follows high-profile investigations into a few Chinese organizations that authorities suspect are pyramid schemes. Regulators didn't mention any company by name.\par \par \uc2 But the news pummeled the shares of \uc2 Herbalife\uc2  and a number of other foreign multilevel marketers, which pay salespeople for recruiting other salespeople, as well as for actual sales. The firms have a significant presence in China, whose fast-growing direct-sales market is the world's second-biggest after the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Herbalife\uc2 , which peddles nutritional supplements and draws 20% of its revenue from the Asia-Pacific region, has been embroiled in a yearslong battle between billionaire investors \uc2 William Ackman\uc2  and \uc2 Carl Icahn\uc2  over whether it operates as a pyramid scheme.\par \par \uc2 Herbalife\uc2  and Mr. Icahn, who has amassed a large stake in the company and claimed several board seats, have said it doesn't. Last year, \uc2 Herbalife\uc2  agreed with the \uc2 U.S. Federal Trade Commission\uc2  to pay $200 million to settle government allegations that it misled consumers. The FTC stopped short of calling \uc2 Herbalife\uc2  an illegal pyramid scheme, although it forced the company to make significant changes to its business model.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ackman, who has bet big against \uc2 Herbalife\uc2 , has said the company operates an illegal pyramid scheme. He has targeted the company's operations in China, claiming that \uc2 Herbalife\uc2  pays its distributors commissions on sales from downstream recruits, which violates Chinese law.\par \par \uc2 "The FTC's conclusion that \uc2 Herbalife\uc2 's compensation plan incentivizes recruiting and qualification buying clearly shows that \uc2 Herbalife\uc2  is operating in violation of Chinese law," a spokesman for Mr. Ackman's fund, \uc2 Pershing Square Capital Management LP\uc2 , said in a statement this week.\par \par \uc2 Herbalife\uc2  has contended that its compensation model differs in China from other countries, and complies with Chinese regulations.\par \par \uc2 Fear of social unrest has made Beijing increasingly wary of fraudulent investment schemes. Pyramid scheme operators\u8212\'20\'14who have been known in China to extort money from targets or even kidnap them\u8212\'20\'14are in the crosshairs.

The industry generated $34 billion in retail sales last year, second only to the U.S. and nearly 20% of the industry's world-wide total, according to the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations.\par \par \uc2 Around one-third of the 92 companies licensed as direct sellers in China are foreign funded, according to data from \uc2 China's Ministry of Commerce\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 China has come down hard on such sellers in the past. In 1998, the Chinese government banned direct sales after it found some companies had set up pyramid schemes and cheated consumers in door-to-door sales frauds.\par \par \uc2 It lifted the ban in 2005 under pressure from the U.S., but tightened the rules on direct sellers.

Schwarzman\uc2 , who organized the conference call, called the White House and spoke with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and a presidential adviser, to give him the news, according to a person familiar with the call. Around the same time, the manufacturing council also had a call and decided to disband.\par \par \uc2 Within minutes of the call to Mr. Kushner, Mr. Trump posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that he had dissolved the councils: "Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!"\par \par \uc2 A White House spokesman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The unraveling of the business councils marks a dramatic moment in corporate America's relationship with the presidency.\par \par \uc2 From its start, the Trump White House had proclaimed an open-door policy for the country's top business leaders. Many chief executives, while wary of being associated with the president's more contentious policies, such as on immigration and climate change, have been eager to help Mr. Trump, a fellow businessman, shape his agenda of deregulation and tax overhaul.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 .'s \uc2 James Dimon\uc2  wrote that he disagreed with Mr. Trump's reaction to recent clashes in Charlottesville, according to an internal memo sent Wednesday afternoon and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. "Racism, intolerance and violence are always wrong\u8230\'20\'26There is no room for equivocation here," Mr. Dimon said. "It is a leader's role, in business or in government, to bring people together, not tear them apart."\par \par \uc2 Companies Wednesday stopped short of saying they would refuse to work with the White House in the future, though executives and corporate crisis managers noted that the reputational costs of sticking with the president have risen sharply.\par \par \uc2 Several CEOs have faced pressure from their own employees or parts of the public for remaining on the council, including International Business Machines Corp.'sGinni Rometty and PepsiCo'sIndra Nooyi.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Rometty and Ms. Nooyi, along with Boston Consulting Group's Rich Lesser and BlackRock Inc. chief Laurence Fink, were among several leaders who joined Wednesday's call prepared to resign from the Strategic and Policy Forum, participants said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schwarzman led Wednesday's call and gave each member an opportunity to speak, people who participated on the call said.\par \par \uc2 "It became clear very quickly that there was a consensus" to disband the group in total, one participant said. "It was important that it be addressed as a group and not a drip-drip."\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It is a leader's role, in business or in government, to bring people together, not tear them apart.'\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Executive \uc2 James Dimon\par \par \uc2 Some panel members said they regretted losing a seat at the table as the White House deliberated on policies that could affect their companies, especially with a president who wasn't familiar with many of their industries.\par \par \uc2 But members observed that the Strategic and Policy Forum only met twice in about eight months, with about half of the council members attending both meetings.\par \par \uc2 Jim McNerney, the former CEO of Boeing, didn't agree with disbanding the group, according to people on the call, yet agreed to go along with the decision. Attempts to reach Mr. McNerney for comment were unsuccessful.\par \par \uc2 Toward the end of the conversation, a participant raised the specter of a "tweet storm" in reaction from Mr. Trump, participants said. Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump tweeted angrily after the CEOs of \uc2 Merck & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Intel Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Under Armour Inc\uc2 . announced they were quitting his manufacturing council.\par \par \uc2 Business leaders now face the challenge of trying to stay in the president's ear without a formal advisory position. Two companies whose leaders served on the Strategic and Policy Forum indicated Wednesday they would remain open to advising the president on future policy matters.\par \par \uc2 Created in the early days of the Trump presidency, the Strategic and Policy Forum and manufacturing-advisory council gathered CEOs for Mr. Trump to consult as he implemented a broad economic plan that included reworking the U.S. tax code and trying to stem the flow of U.S. jobs to other countries.\par \par \uc2 Individual members of both councils had discussed disbanding the forum for months, especially after the decision to leave the Paris climate accord in June and again in July when Mr. Trump barred transgender individuals from serving in the military, members said.\par \par \uc2 Yet plenty of executives saw value in remaining on the forums until Tuesday afternoon's news conference. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky issued a statement early Tuesday that said he would remain on the manufacturing council and advocate for values like diversity and inclusion from the inside.\par \par \uc2 But President Trump's news conference made staying untenable for most members. On Wednesday, Mr. Gorsky issued another statement saying he was leaving the council. "The President's most recent statements equating those who are motivated by race-based hate with those who stand up against hatred is unacceptable and has changed our decision to participate," Mr. Gorsky said.\par \par \uc2 Executives have faced tough questions from workers and young recruits over their relationship with the White House. A poll initiated by \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2  employees this week on Fishbowl, a social network for professionals, found 83% of more than 100 respondents thought Mr. Lesser, the CEO, should step down from the advisory council.\par \par \uc2 Around 40 people protested outside the New York offices of \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  and then \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  on Wednesday, and social-media campaigns heavily criticized corporate chiefs for not quitting the councils.\par \par \uc2 Color of Change, a nonprofit activist group, spearheaded a campaign with the hashtag #QuitTheCouncil and aimed its posts at executives including Campbell Soup CEO \uc2 Denise Morrison\uc2  and \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 's Ms. Nooyi.

Aug. 16, 2017\par \par \uc2 Sale of Once Hot High-Frequency Trading Firm Reflects Industry Troubles\par \par \uc2 By Alexander Osipovich\par \par \uc2 They shook up Wall Street, changing the way the financial industry trades stocks, bonds and derivatives. Now, high-speed traders are in retreat.\par \par \uc2 These upstart firms use sophisticated computer algorithms to move in and out of stocks, futures and other positions in fractions of a second. Known as high-frequency traders, or HFT, they thrived in the years following the financial crisis by exploiting the markets' big price swings.\par \par \uc2 After big Wall Street banks lost business to these more nimble traders, they copied them and began to introduce HFT-style algos and technology on their own expansive trading floors.\par \par \uc2 But more recently, there have been fewer dramatic swings in stocks, commodities and other markets. The CBOE Volatility Index, a widely followed measure of expected U.S. stock-market volatility, has hovered near historic lows this year.\par \par \uc2 Now, one electronic trading firm's deal to acquire a struggling rival shows how this persistently low volatility is upending the HFT world and forcing out weaker players.\par \par \uc2 DRW Holdings LLC, a Chicago-based firm with one of the largest high-speed trading platforms, said on Wednesday it is acquiring \uc2 RGM Advisors LLC\uc2 . The two privately held firms declined to disclose the terms of the deal, which they expect to close next month.\par \par \uc2 RGM turned big profits in the years after the financial crisis, say people close to the firm. It was once among the most visible firms in the often secretive high-speed trading world, where companies jealously guard their algorithms.\par \par \uc2 During its peak years after the crisis, RGM accounted for as much as 5% of U.S. equities trading volume, said a person close to the firm. Walls in the firm's downtown Austin, Tx., office were decorated with cartoonish images of robots.\par \par \uc2 But while the lack of volatility has provided a favorable backdrop for stock markets that climb to new highs, it has been disastrous for the once-thriving HFT business.\par \par \uc2 A costly high-tech arms race in which HFT firms relentlessly compete to shave tiny fractions of a second off data transmission times has also hurt their bottom lines.\par \par \uc2 Revenue at HFT firms from U.S. equities trading is projected to be just $850 million this year, compared to $7.2 billion in revenue from U.S. stocks trading in 2009, \uc2 Tabb Group\uc2  says.\par \par \uc2 Techniques pioneered by the upstart traders are now common at old-line financial firms. \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , for example, had 600 human traders supporting its cash equities business in 2000. That number is down to a handful, the bank said recently. They are supported by hundreds of engineers.\par \par \uc2 Big Wall Street banks now plug directly into exchanges' data centers, speeding up each trade by milliseconds, to better execute trades for institutional clients. HFT firms were initially the heaviest users of such "co-location" services.\par \par \uc2 RGM was among the innovators, but its business deteriorated amid the recent lack of market volatility. The firm made around $800 million in trading profits over its lifetime, but this year it has been losing money, prompting its owners to accelerate efforts to find a buyer, a person close to the firm said. RGM has also cut staff to around 70 employees, down from more than 100 a few years ago.\par \par \uc2 This week, RGM agreed to sell the firm for what one person close to the deal said was less than $10 million.\par \par \uc2 Both DRW and RGM declined to comment on the deal's size.\par \par \uc2 But DRW founder and chief executive Donald Wilson Jr. said his firm will be among the survivors.\par \par \uc2 "DRW is positioned to continue to perform well in a variety of market conditions because we are diversified across risk holding periods and asset classes," he wrote in an emailed statement.\par \par \uc2 RGM becomes the latest firm to succumb to a wave of consolidation that has whittled down HFT firms' ranks. In July, \uc2 Virtu Financial Inc\uc2 . completed a $1.4 billion acquisition of rival \uc2 KCG Holdings\uc2 . The combined firm handles around one in five shares traded in U.S. equity markets each day.\par \par \uc2 Others have scaled back or shut down. Thomas Peterffy, chairman and chief executive of Interactive Brokers Group Inc., said in March he would end his firm's options market-making activities. Two Sigma Securities agreed to buy the business in May.\par \par \uc2 "We're still in the midst of the industry consolidating and reorganizing itself," said Eric Pritchett, chief executive of Potamus Trading LLC, an electronic trading firm based in Boston. "I don't think we're done."\par \par \uc2 RGM was founded in 2001 by three men: Robbie Robinette, who had studied physics at the \uc2 University of Texas at Austin\uc2 ; \uc2 Richard Gorelick\uc2 , a lawyer by training; and Mark Melton, a software developer with a specialty in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . They chose the name "RGM" after their initials, launching operations in Mr. Robinette's living room.\par \par \uc2 The firm made $17 on its first day of trading in December 2001, which its founders used to buy three margaritas, according to an interview with Mr. Robinette posted on RGM's website. RGM eventually expanded into futures, currencies, fixed income and European and Japanese equities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gorelick, who is also the chief executive, defended high-speed trading when it came under attack in Michael Lewis's 2014 book "Flash Boys." The book, which was published as RGM and many of its peers were starting their decline, attacked HFT firms for allegedly taking advantage of slower-moving investors. Mr. Gorelick also testified on Capitol Hill last year to lobby against proposed regulations for algorithmic trading firms.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that RGM had held talks with Chicago-based \uc2 Allston Trading LLC\uc2  about a possible merger. The deal never came to fruition, people familiar with the situation said. Allston declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The next year, RGM closed its London office. It moved to liquidate what remained of its European trading subsidiary last November, U.K. company filings show.\par \par \uc2 Appeared in the August 17, 2017, print edition as \u8216\'20\'18Speed Traders Whittle Down.'\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 U.K. Audit Regulator Fines PwC, Senior Auditor\par \par \uc2 The Financial Reporting Council\uc2 , the U.K. regulator for audit, accounting and reporting, has fined \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers\uc2  and a senior auditor in relation to the audit of financial statements of RSM Tenon.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 They shook up Wall Street, changing the way the financial industry trades stocks, bonds and derivatives. Now, high-speed traders are in retreat.\par \par \uc2 These upstart firms use sophisticated computer algorithms to move in and out of stocks, futures and other positions in fractions of a second. Known as high-frequency traders, or HFT, they thrived in the years following the financial crisis by exploiting the markets' big price swings.\par \par \uc2 After big Wall Street banks lost business to these more nimble traders, they copied them and began to introduce HFT-style algos and technology on their own expansive trading floors.\par \par \uc2 But more recently, there have been fewer dramatic swings in stocks, commodities and other markets. The \uc2 CBOE\uc2  Volatility Index, a widely followed measure of expected U.S. stock-market volatility, has hovered near historic lows this year.\par \par \uc2 Now, one electronic trading firm's deal to acquire a struggling rival shows how this {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/high-frequency-traders-fall-on-hard-times-1490092200"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 persistently low volatility is upending the HFT world }}}\uc2 and forcing out weaker players.\par \par \uc2 DRW Holdings LLC, a Chicago-based firm with one of the largest high-speed trading platforms, said on Wednesday it is acquiring \uc2 RGM Advisors LLC\uc2 . The two privately held firms declined to disclose the terms of the deal, which they expect to close next month.\par \par \uc2 RGM turned big profits in the years after the financial crisis, say people close to the firm. It was once among the most visible firms in the often secretive high-speed trading world, where companies jealously guard their algorithms.\par \par \uc2 During its peak years after the crisis, RGM accounted for as much as 5% of U.S. equities trading volume, said a person close to the firm. Walls in the firm's downtown Austin, Tx., office were decorated with cartoonish images of robots.\par \par \uc2 But while the lack of volatility has provided a favorable backdrop for stock markets that climb to new highs, it has been disastrous for the once-thriving HFT business.\par \par \uc2 A costly high-tech arms race in which HFT firms relentlessly compete to shave tiny fractions of a second off data transmission times has also hurt their bottom lines.\par \par \uc2 Revenue at HFT firms from U.S. equities trading is projected to be just $850 million this year, compared to $7.2 billion in revenue from U.S. stocks trading in 2009, \uc2 Tabb Group\uc2  says.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-does-high-frequency-trading-affect-individual-investors-1408454495"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Techniques pioneered by the upstart traders }}}\uc2 are now common at old-line financial firms. \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , for example, had 600 human traders supporting its cash equities business in 2000. That number is down to a handful, the bank said recently. They are supported by hundreds of engineers.\par \par \uc2 Big Wall Street banks now plug directly into exchanges' data centers, speeding up each trade by milliseconds, to better execute trades for institutional clients. HFT firms were initially the heaviest users of such "co-location" services.\par \par \uc2 RGM was among the innovators, but its business deteriorated amid the recent lack of market volatility. The firm made around $800 million in trading profits over its lifetime, but this year it has been losing money, prompting its owners to accelerate efforts to find a buyer, a person close to the firm said. RGM has also cut staff to around 70 employees, down from more than 100 a few years ago.\par \par \uc2 This week, RGM agreed to sell the firm for what one person close to the deal said was less than $10 million.\par \par \uc2 Both DRW and RGM declined to comment on the deal's size.\par \par \uc2 But DRW founder and chief executive Donald Wilson Jr. said his firm will be among the survivors.\par \par \uc2 "DRW is positioned to continue to perform well in a variety of market conditions because we are diversified across risk holding periods and asset classes," he wrote in an emailed statement.\par \par \uc2 RGM becomes the latest firm to succumb to a wave of consolidation that has whittled down HFT firms' ranks. In July, \uc2 Virtu Financial Inc\uc2 . completed{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/virtu-financial-agrees-to-buy-kcg-holdings-for-1-4-billion-1492689363"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  a $1.4 billion acquisition of rival }}}\uc2 KCG Holdings\uc2 .

Through a series of apps, employers can identify inefficiencies, overspending or gaps in care, then receive suggested fixes such as implementing a telemedicine service or changing their prescription coverage plan.\par \par \uc2 Artemis last received financing at the end of 2016 and had a pre-money valuation of $18.1 million as of May 2017. The latest round brings the company's total funding to date to $26 million.\par \par \uc2 Artemis's service is similar to that offered by much larger and older companies, such as \uc2 Towers Watson\uc2 -acquired Liazon or \uc2 Truven Health \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which was acquired by IBM Watson Health last year for $2.6 billion. But the company's approach is a bit different in that it focuses on the benefits manager as the target user rather than multiple users such as payers, providers or employees themselves.\par \par \uc2 "We focus on the benefits people, who are chronically undersupported," said Artemis CEO and founder Grant Gordon. "We do the heavy lifting of data integration and organization so we can offer an approachable user interface with responsive customer service they would expect from consumer-facing software."\par \par \uc2 It is keeping that user in mind that has led to the company's quick growth, Mr. Gordon said. Since launching, the company has gained 26 customers including large employers like GE, \uc2 Intuit\uc2  and AAA, and it has analyzed some $5.8 billion in health care spending.\par \par \uc2 F-Prime Capital partner Jon Lim, who led the investment and will take a board position, said his decision to back Artemis was influenced by the company's diligence with their customers and response to feedback.\par \par \uc2 "They've gotten to the point of really understanding on intimate levels the pain points the market is experiencing," said Mr. Lim.\par \par \uc2 The company plans to use the funding to hire and develop new products.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170816ed8g0008e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Investors are snapping up a new type of security sold by \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , increasingly assuming the risks of mortgage defaults from taxpayers and powering a quiet transformation of the housing giants after almost a decade of government control.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie have sold roughly $48 billion of the securities since 2013 to a broadening group of buyers, including asset managers and insurance companies. Sales are expected to reach a fresh high of $15 billion this year, up from the previous record $13 billion last year, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The sales mark an early step toward reducing the government's role in the $14.4 trillion U.S. mortgage market. The amount of mortgage debt funneled through Fannie and Freddie and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%.\par \par \uc2 The progress has come despite a long-running stalemate in Congress, which has stumbled in its effort to design a replacement for the decades-old housing-finance system that centers on Fannie and Freddie.\par \par \uc2 It may not be happening as people anticipated, but "the government's footprint in the mortgage market is receding quickly and significantly," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The market for the so-called credit-risk transfers has boomed even as the one for privately issued mortgage-backed securities has remained mostly dormant, a sign that investors have greater comfort in the standards and transparency of these deals than in those issued by Wall Street banks that performed so poorly after the housing bust.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie don't make loans, but buy them from lenders and bundle them into securities. Those bonds typically carry a guarantee that Fannie and Freddie will pay investors if the underlying mortgages default, leaving investors with only the risk that the bonds will lose value if interest rates rise.\par \par \uc2 The credit-risk transfers don't carry that guarantee. Nevertheless, they have proved popular with investors, who have concluded that the yields they offer are worth the added risk. As the market has developed, banks have been willing to trade them, easing concerns that they would need to offer premium yields because they would be difficult for buyers to unload.\par \par \uc2 Reflecting the strong interest, the average yield that investors have demanded to hold one version of the instrument has fallen by more than half in just two years, to roughly 1.5 percentage points on top of a benchmark floating interest rate, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The pool of investors buying the securities is also widening to what many consider more stable sources of capital, a sign of their changing status. While hedge funds made up the largest group of early investors, that distinction now belongs to more traditional money managers, according to J.P. Morgan Securities. Though still small players in the market, insurance companies and real-estate investment trusts have also increased their buying in some recent deals.\par \par \uc2 Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle, said he bought both Fannie and Freddie risk transfers for the firm's Strategic Income Fund and then sold them as the market rallied.\par \par \uc2 "Liquidity has definitely improved as more securities have been issued," he said.\par \par \uc2 The mortgage giants are transferring risk on the loans most likely to default -- those of more than 20 years where homeowners have made less than a 40% down payment. Last year, such mortgages accounted for 60% of all of the single-family mortgages they acquired, according to the \uc2 Federal Housing Finance Agency\uc2 , which oversees the companies.\par \par \uc2 How much risk Fannie and Freddie have shed depends in part on the severity of defaults. In a normal economic expansion, investors would likely shoulder around 20% of the losses in the mortgages underlying the securities, according to a new report by Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . But that number would jump to around 60% to 70% if there were another severe recession comparable to the last one -- enough, if the firms were private, to possibly avoid a federal bailout, according to the \uc2 Moody's\uc2  report, which was written by analysts including Mr. Zandi.\par \par \uc2 The variability is a result of the securities' structure. Each comprises several tranches, linked to a pool of mortgages, with losses from defaults hitting the bottom tranche first and the top tranche last.\par \par \uc2 On almost all securities, Fannie and Freddie still own the riskiest and the safest tranches, seeing it as uneconomical to sell them to investors. That means they are exposed to mild losses, largely shielded from moderate to severe losses, but vulnerable again once defaults reach a catastrophic level.\par \par \uc2 The securities are one part of a government effort to revamp the housing giants. Since being placed under conservatorship in 2008, the firms have adopted a more stable business model by shrinking their once huge investment portfolios and raising the fees they charge lenders to guarantee mortgages. They have also joined forces to build a common system for securitizing home loans.\par \par \uc2 The securities aren't without controversy. Some observers have expressed concerns that Fannie and Freddie are paying investors too much for the risk they are shedding. The securities have also been drawn into a larger debate about what the government should do with Fannie and Freddie, which stand in limbo between the public and private sectors.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 The amount of new one-to-four family mortgage debt funneled through \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2 , \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%. A Page One article Aug. 15 about sales of securities by Fannie and Freddie didn't make clear that the sentence referred to new mortgage debt for one-to-four-family housing units rather than all mortgage debt.\par \par \uc2 (WSJE September 11, 2017)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170815000044"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170815ed8f00017\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The amount of new one-to-four family mortgage debt funneled through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%. A Business & Finance article Aug. 15 about sales of securities by Fannie and Freddie didn't make clear that the sentence referred to new mortgage debt for one-to-four-family housing units rather than all mortgage debt.\par \par \uc2 (WSJA September 11, 2017)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 Investors are snapping up a new type of security sold by \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , increasingly assuming the risks of mortgage defaults from taxpayers and powering a quiet transformation of the housing giants after almost a decade of government control.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie have sold roughly $48 billion of the securities since 2013 to a broadening group of buyers, including asset managers and insurance companies. Sales are expected to reach a fresh high of $15 billion this year, up from the previous record $13 billion last year, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The sales mark an early step toward reducing the government's role in the $14.4 trillion U.S. mortgage market. The amount of mortgage debt funneled through Fannie and Freddie and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%.\par \par \uc2 The progress has come despite a long-running stalemate in Congress, which has stumbled in its effort to design a replacement for the decades-old housing-finance system that centers on Fannie and Freddie.\par \par \uc2 It may not be happening as people anticipated, but "the government's footprint in the mortgage market is receding quickly and significantly," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The market for the so-called credit-risk transfers has boomed even as the one for privately issued mortgage-backed securities has remained mostly dormant, a sign that investors have greater comfort in the standards and transparency of these deals than in those issued by Wall Street banks that performed so poorly after the housing bust.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie don't make loans, but buy them from lenders and bundle them into securities. Those bonds typically carry a guarantee that Fannie and Freddie will pay investors if the underlying mortgages default, leaving investors with only the risk that the bonds will lose value if interest rates rise.\par \par \uc2 The credit-risk transfers don't carry that guarantee. Nevertheless, they have proved popular with investors, who have concluded that the yields they offer are worth the added risk. As the market has developed, banks have been willing to trade them, easing concerns that they would need to offer premium yields because they would be difficult for buyers to unload.\par \par \uc2 Reflecting the strong interest, the average yield that investors have demanded to hold one version of the instrument has fallen by more than half in just two years, to roughly 1.5 percentage points on top of a benchmark floating interest rate, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The pool of investors buying the securities is also widening to what many consider more stable sources of capital, a sign of their changing status. While hedge funds made up the largest group of early investors, that distinction now belongs to more traditional money managers, according to J.P. Morgan Securities. Though still small players in the market, insurance companies and real-estate investment trusts have also increased their buying in some recent deals.\par \par \uc2 Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle, said he bought both Fannie and Freddie risk transfers for the firm's Strategic Income Fund and then sold them as the market rallied.\par \par \uc2 "Liquidity has definitely improved as more securities have been issued," he said.\par \par \uc2 The mortgage giants are transferring risk on the loans most likely to default -- those of more than 20 years where homeowners have made less than a 40% down payment. Last year, such mortgages accounted for 60% of all of the single-family mortgages they acquired, according to the \uc2 Federal Housing Finance Agency\uc2 , which oversees the companies.\par \par \uc2 How much risk Fannie and Freddie have shed depends in part on the severity of defaults. In a normal economic expansion, investors would likely shoulder around 20% of the losses in the mortgages underlying the securities, according to a new report by Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But that number would jump to around 60% to 70% if there were another severe recession comparable to the last one -- enough, if the firms were private, to possibly avoid a federal bailout, according to the \uc2 Moody's\uc2  report, which was written by analysts including Mr. Zandi.\par \par \uc2 The variability is a result of the securities' structure. Each comprises several tranches, linked to a pool of mortgages, with losses from defaults hitting the bottom tranche first and the top tranche last.\par \par \uc2 On almost all securities, Fannie and Freddie still own the riskiest and the safest tranches, seeing it as uneconomical to sell them to investors. That means they are exposed to mild losses, largely shielded from moderate to severe losses, but vulnerable again once defaults reach a catastrophic level.\par \par \uc2 The securities are one part of a larger government effort to revamp the housing giants. Since being placed under conservatorship in 2008 -- when then-Treasury Secretary \uc2 Henry Paulson\uc2  said the government had a responsibility to address their systemic risk -- the firms have adopted a more stable business model by shrinking their once huge investment portfolios and raising the fees they charge lenders to guarantee mortgages. They have also joined forces to build a common system for securitizing home loans.\par \par \uc2 The securities aren't without controversy. Some observers have expressed concerns that Fannie and Freddie are paying investors too much for the risk they are shedding. Investors could also demand sharply higher yields in a market downturn, forcing Fannie and Freddie to either stop selling the securities, increasing their exposure to future defaults, or raise fees they charge lenders, potentially making home loans more expensive.\par \par \uc2 The securities have also been drawn into a larger debate about what the government should do with Fannie and Freddie, which stand in limbo between the public and private sectors -- sending nearly all of their profits to the \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  despite reporting quarterly earnings and having shares outstanding.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170814000026"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170814ed8f0000n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The amount of new one-to-four family mortgage debt funneled through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%. A Page One article Aug. 15 about sales of securities by Fannie and Freddie didn't make clear that the sentence referred to new mortgage debt for one-to-four-family housing units rather than all mortgage debt.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ September 8, 2017)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 Investors are snapping up securities sold by \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  that shift mortgage default risk away from taxpayers, powering a quiet transformation of the housing giants after almost a decade of government control.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie have sold roughly $48 billion of the securities since 2013, transferring a large measure of risk on roughly one-third of the single-family mortgages they guarantee. Sales are expected to reach a fresh high of $15 billion this year, up from the previous record $13 billion last year, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The sales mark an early step toward reducing the government's role in the $14.4 trillion U.S. mortgage market. The amount of mortgage debt funneled through Fannie and Freddie and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%.\par \par \uc2 The progress has come despite a long-running stalemate in Congress, which has stumbled in its effort to design a replacement for the decades-old housing-finance system that centers on Fannie and Freddie.\par \par \uc2 It may not be happening as people anticipated, but "the government's footprint in the mortgage market is receding quickly and significantly," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The market for the so-called credit-risk transfers has boomed even as the one for privately issued mortgage-backed securities has remained mostly dormant, a sign that investors have greater comfort in the standards and transparency of these deals than in those issued by Wall Street banks that performed so poorly after the housing bust.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie don't make loans, but buy them from lenders and bundle them into securities. Those bonds typically carry a guarantee that Fannie and Freddie will pay investors if the underlying mortgages default, leaving investors with only the risk that the bonds will lose value if interest rates rise.\par \par \uc2 The credit-risk transfers don't carry that guarantee. Nevertheless, they have proved popular with investors, who have concluded that the yields they offer are worth the added risk. As the market has developed, banks have been willing to trade them, easing concerns that they would need to offer premium yields because they would be difficult for buyers to unload.\par \par \uc2 Reflecting the strong interest, the average yield that investors have demanded to hold one version of the instrument has fallen by more than half in just two years, to roughly 1.7 percentage points on top of a benchmark floating interest rate, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The pool of investors buying the securities is also widening to what many consider more stable sources of capital, a sign of their changing status. While hedge funds made up the largest group of early investors, that distinction now belongs to more traditional money managers, according to J.P. Morgan Securities. Though still small players in the market, insurance companies and real-estate investment trusts have also increased their buying in some recent deals.\par \par \uc2 Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle, said he bought both Fannie and Freddie risk transfers for the firm's Strategic Income Fund and then sold them as the market rallied.\par \par \uc2 "Liquidity has definitely improved as more securities have been issued," he said.\par \par \uc2 The mortgage giants are transferring risk on the loans most likely to default -- those of more than 20 years where homeowners have made less than a 40% down payment. Last year, such mortgages accounted for 60% of all of the single-family mortgages they acquired, according to the \uc2 Federal Housing Finance Agency\uc2 , which oversees the companies.\par \par \uc2 How much risk Fannie and Freddie have shed depends in part on the severity of defaults. In a normal economic expansion, investors would likely shoulder around 20% of the losses in the mortgages underlying the securities, according to a new report by Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But that number would jump to around 60% to 70% if there were another severe recession comparable to the last one -- enough, if the firms were private, to possibly avoid a federal bailout, according to the \uc2 Moody's\uc2  report, which was written by analysts including Mr. Zandi.\par \par \uc2 The variability is a result of the securities' structure. Each comprises several tranches, linked to a pool of mortgages, with losses from defaults hitting the bottom tranche first and the top tranche last.\par \par \uc2 On almost all securities, Fannie and Freddie still own the riskiest and the safest tranches, seeing it as uneconomical to sell them to investors. That means they are exposed to mild losses, largely shielded from moderate to severe losses, but vulnerable again if defaults reach a catastrophic level.\par \par \uc2 The securities are one part of a larger government effort to revamp the housing giants. Since being placed under conservatorship in 2008 -- when then-Treasury Secretary \uc2 Henry Paulson\uc2  said the government had a responsibility to address their systemic risk -- the firms have adopted a more stable business model by shrinking their once huge investment portfolios and raising the fees they charge lenders to guarantee mortgages. They have also joined forces to build a common system for securitizing home loans that could ultimately be used by other firms.\par \par \uc2 The securities aren't without controversy. Some observers have expressed concerns that Fannie and Freddie are paying investors too much for the risk they are shedding. Investors could also demand sharply higher yields in a market downturn, forcing Fannie and Freddie to either stop selling the securities, increasing their exposure to future defaults, or raise fees they charge lenders, potentially making home loans more expensive.\par \par \uc2 The securities have also been drawn into a larger debate about what the government should do with Fannie and Freddie, which stand in limbo between the public and private sectors -- sending nearly all of their profits to the \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  despite reporting quarterly earnings and having shares outstanding.\par \par \uc2 Some of the securities' strongest advocates include those who want the companies to be dismantled, replaced with a larger number of private firms or a single, government-run utility, which they say would disperse risk and avoid another taxpayer-funded bailout.\par \par \uc2 Many shareholders, however, want to preserve the companies in near their current form while releasing them from conservatorship. One group has backed a proposal that would provide incentives for the institutions to issue risk transfers without mandating them.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich489\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal7335

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The amount of new one-to-four family mortgage debt funneled through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%. An earlier version of this article didn't make clear that the sentence referred to new mortgage debt for one-to-four-family housing units rather than all mortgage debt. (Sept. 7, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Investors are snapping up securities sold by \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  that shift mortgage default risk away from taxpayers, powering a quiet transformation of the housing giants after almost a decade of government control.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie have sold roughly $48 billion of the securities since 2013, transferring a large measure of risk on roughly one-third of the single-family mortgages they guarantee.

An earlier version of this article didn't make clear that the sentence referred to new mortgage debt for one-to-four-family housing units rather than all mortgage debt. (Sept. 7, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Investors are snapping up securities sold by \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  that shift mortgage default risk away from taxpayers, powering a quiet transformation of the housing giants after almost a decade of government control.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie have sold roughly $48 billion of the securities since 2013, transferring a large measure of risk on roughly one-third of the single-family mortgages they guarantee. Sales are expected to reach a fresh high of $15 billion this year, up from the previous record $13 billion last year, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The sales mark an early step toward reducing the government's role in the $14.4 trillion U.S. mortgage market. The amount of new one-to-four family mortgage debt funneled through Fannie and Freddie and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%.\par \par \uc2 The progress has come despite a long-running stalemate in Congress, which has stumbled in its effort to design a replacement for the decades-old housing-finance system that centers on Fannie and Freddie.\par \par \uc2 It may not be happening as people anticipated, but "the government's footprint in the mortgage market is receding quickly and significantly," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The market for the so-called credit-risk transfers has boomed even as the one for privately issued mortgage-backed securities has remained mostly dormant, a sign that investors have greater comfort in the standards and transparency of these deals than in those issued by Wall Street banks that performed so poorly after the housing bust.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie don't make loans, but buy them from lenders and bundle them into securities. Those bonds typically carry a guarantee that Fannie and Freddie will pay investors if the underlying mortgages default, leaving investors with only the risk that the bonds will lose value if interest rates rise.\par \par \uc2 The credit-risk transfers don't carry that guarantee. Nevertheless, they have proved popular with investors, who have concluded that the yields they offer are worth the added risk. As the market has developed, banks have been willing to trade them, easing concerns that they would need to offer premium yields because they would be difficult for buyers to unload.\par \par \uc2 Reflecting the strong interest, the average yield that investors have demanded to hold one version of the instrument has fallen by more than half in just two years, to roughly 1.5 percentage points on top of a benchmark floating interest rate, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The pool of investors buying the securities is also widening to what many consider more stable sources of capital, a sign of their changing status. While hedge funds made up the largest group of early investors, that distinction now belongs to more traditional money managers, according to J.P. Morgan Securities. Though still small players in the market, insurance companies and real-estate investment trusts have also increased their buying in some recent deals.\par \par \uc2 Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle, said he bought both Fannie and Freddie risk transfers for the firm's Strategic Income Fund and then sold them as the market rallied.\par \par \uc2 "Liquidity has definitely improved as more securities have been issued," he said.\par \par \uc2 The mortgage giants are transferring risk on the loans most likely to default\u8212\'20\'14those of more than 20 years where homeowners have made less than a 40% down payment. Last year, such mortgages accounted for 60% of all of the single-family mortgages they acquired, according to the \uc2 Federal Housing Finance Agency\uc2 , which oversees the companies.\par \par \uc2 How much risk Fannie and Freddie have shed depends in part on the severity of defaults. In a normal economic expansion, investors would likely shoulder around 20% of the losses in the mortgages underlying the securities, according to a new report by Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But that number would jump to around 60% to 70% if there were another severe recession comparable to the last one\u8212\'20\'14enough, if the firms were private, to possibly avoid a federal bailout, according to the \uc2 Moody's\uc2  report, which was written by analysts including Mr. Zandi.\par \par \uc2 The variability is a result of the securities' structure. Each comprises several tranches, linked to a pool of mortgages, with losses from defaults hitting the bottom tranche first and the top tranche last.\par \par \uc2 On almost all securities, Fannie and Freddie still own the riskiest and the safest tranches, seeing it as uneconomical to sell them to investors. That means they are exposed to mild losses, largely shielded from moderate to severe losses, but vulnerable again once defaults reach a catastrophic level.\par \par \uc2 The securities are one part of a larger government effort to revamp the housing giants. Since being placed under conservatorship in 2008\u8212\'20\'14when then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the government had a responsibility to address their systemic risk\u8212\'20\'14the firms have adopted a more stable business model by shrinking their once huge investment portfolios and raising the fees they charge lenders to guarantee mortgages. They have also joined forces to build a common system for securitizing home loans that could ultimately be used by other firms.\par \par \uc2 The securities aren't without controversy. Some observers have expressed concerns that Fannie and Freddie are paying investors too much for the risk they are shedding. Investors could also demand sharply higher yields in a market downturn, forcing Fannie and Freddie to either stop selling the securities, increasing their exposure to future defaults, or raise fees they charge lenders, potentially making home loans more expensive.\par \par \uc2 The securities have also been drawn into a larger debate about what the government should do with Fannie and Freddie, which stand in limbo between the public and private sectors\u8212\'20\'14sending nearly all of their profits to the \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  despite reporting quarterly earnings and having shares outstanding.\par \par \uc2 Some of the securities' strongest advocates include those who want the companies to be dismantled, replaced with a larger number of private firms or a single, government-run utility, which they say would disperse risk and avoid another taxpayer-funded bailout.\par \par \uc2 Many shareholders, however, want to preserve the companies in near their current form while releasing them from conservatorship. One group has funded a proposal that would provide incentives for the institutions to issue risk transfers without mandating them.\par \par \uc2 Risk-transfers are a useful tool, said Landon Parsons, a senior adviser at \uc2 Moelis & Company\uc2 , which created the plan, but they "may not be available during a business cycle downturn at a reasonable cost."\par \par \uc2 Write to Sam Goldfarb at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:sam.goldfarb@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sam.goldfarb@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROBK20170815ed8e000ji\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The consultancy estimates about 520,000 people work in the asset management industry globally.\par \par \uc2 Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of Opimas, says AI will lead to job cuts in the back office, operations and customer service. \u8220\'20\'1CSome portfolio managers feel that AI cannot replace them in the investment-decision process. However, we are already seeing this replacement occur,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is particularly true with a shift to passive investment strategies, where a surprising number of investment decisions are still handled by human portfolio managers. This is an area ready to be automated by AI.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 However, fund companies fiercely deny that their growing use of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques, which help portfolio managers spot patterns in vast streams of data, will trigger a dramatic fall in headcount.\par \par \uc2 Although \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms have been used by computer-driven hedge funds for decades, Baillie Gifford is one of several mainstream fund managers that are turning to AI for the first time in a bid to boost returns.\par \par \uc2 Kyle McEnery, an investment analyst at the Scottish fund house, says his colleagues \u8220\'20\'1Chad a long talk about jobs being under threat\u8221\'20\'1D when the project was in its early stages.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe first very positive thing I would say is anything that we automate will only mean investors have more time doing much more valuable tasks and coming up with new ideas,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CIn investment in particular, I think this would be mainly welcomed by our human investors.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Baillie Gifford, one of the UK\u8217\'20\'19s oldest asset managers, has hired a mathematician to help with its AI project, which is being led by four staff from its IT and investment teams. The Edinburgh-based company will hire more specialists if it becomes \u8220\'20\'1Creally obvious\u8221\'20\'1D the algorithms are improving investment performance, Mr McEnery adds.\par \par \uc2 A senior executive at a large hedge fund, speaking privately, says fears that widespread adoption of AI could result in mass redundancies for high-earning portfolio managers are misplaced.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you are executing small trades, I think most people would agree a machine is better at doing that. If you are trying to understand the prospects of a company by speaking to a new chief executive, at the moment, everyone would say a human is better at doing that,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is about understanding what machines are better at. There are certain jobs that have been automated over the past 10 years. But I don\u8217\'20\'19t think the whole of finance will be automated away. AI removes some work, but creates different work.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Asset Management, Germany\u8217\'20\'19s largest investment house, has also started investigating how to use AI to improve sales techniques and attract clients. The \u8364\'20\'AC711bn asset manager has exchanged data sets with several technology companies that specialise in AI analysis and will soon decide which provider to work with.\par \par \uc2 The Frankfurt-based company wants to use AI to introduce chatbots that can respond to simple questions from retail clients when they come to its website. It also wants to automate how it evaluates meeting reports filed by its thousands of sales staff to get a better indication of mass changes in client sentiment.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche AM additionally wants to sift through publicly available data on the performance of clients\u8217\'20\'19 investments with rival asset managers. This could, in theory, help it judge when best to approach clients about switching their money into better-performing funds.\par \par \uc2 Thorsten Michalik, head of distribution in Europe and Asia for Deutsche AM, denies that using \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to streamline these processes will hit headcount in his division. \u8220\'20\'1CFrom the information generated by AI, we hope we will increase the size of our business, which will mean we need to hire more people,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 In Germany, only 15 per cent of the population invests in funds and stocks, he says. He believes AI will help Deutsche AM access the 70m Germans who have never invested, bringing more money into the company and increasing the need for more staff. Mr Michalik\u8217\'20\'19s team has three specialists focused on AI, and he expects this will triple over the next 12 months.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe would really like to reach, via AI, the 85 per cent who are not currently invested. We need to increase the size of the market. The only way we can do this is by using new technology. [Our] people understand this,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 The huge interest in AI has created jobs elsewhere across the sector. According to \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 , the professional networking website, there has been a surge in the number of financial services companies, including banks and asset managers, seeking data scientists over the past two years.\par \par \uc2 There are 6,300 data scientist jobs within financial services currently advertised on \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The number of roles advertised in the sector using the terms data scientist, \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  or \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , has more than tripled over the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Steve Cohen\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Point72, \uc2 Neuberger Berman\uc2  and Wellington Capital are among the large alternative investment managers that are looking to hire more data scientists to work alongside their investment teams.\par \par \uc2 Investors\u8217\'20\'19 growing interest in this area comes on the back of an explosion in the amount of data available online.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 Unigestion\uc2 , the Swiss asset manager, 90 per cent of available data has been created in the past three years, coming from a mix of sources, including weather sensors, social networks, satellite images, online transactions and GPS signals.\par \par \uc2 With the internet of things \u8212\'20\'14 everyday objects connected to the internet \u8212\'20\'14 forecast to grow from 8bn to 20bn devices by 2020, the number of data points will grow exponentially, the Geneva-based asset manager said in a recent research paper.\par \par \uc2 Other mainstream asset managers are also entering the fray. State Street Global Exchange, a division of \uc2 State Street\uc2 , the US custody bank and asset manager, is piloting a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  tool that aims to send alerts to large investors when news breaks that could hurt their portfolios. If a copper mine explodes in North America, for example, \uc2 State Street\uc2  could alert clients with large holdings in Apple to review their positions in the technology company, as it relies on the metal to make its iPhones.\par \par \uc2 Japan\u8217\'20\'19s Nomura Asset Management, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nri.com/global/news/2017/170626_1.aspx"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 said }}}\uc2  in June it had completed a project seeking to assess whether AI can improve the decision-making processes of its portfolio managers. The project, which was carried out with the \uc2 Nomura Research Institute\uc2 , a consultancy, involved systematically labelling data sources for fund managers, such as \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feeds, blogs or news announcements, as positive or negative.\par \par \uc2 This helped Nomura\u8217\'20\'19s investment teams to become \u8220\'20\'1Cmore efficient\u8221\'20\'1D and freed up their time to investigate more interesting investment ideas, according to a spokesman for the NRI.\par \par \uc2 Aldous Birchall, AI lead in the consulting business of PwC, the professional services firm, is more circumspect. He believes some portfolio manager roles will be eliminated as AI is adopted by traditional fund managers.\par \par \uc2 But he adds: \u8220\'20\'1CI would be really surprised to see an apocalypse. I don\u8217\'20\'19t think people will come into the office and be told they have been replaced by a robot. Rather than a team of 10 [portfolio managers running a fund], it will be a team of seven or eight, including a couple of data scientists.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI often get asked \u8212\'20\'14 what\u8217\'20\'19s better, AI or human fund managers? The answer is the best team involves humans plus AI.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170814ed8e000gs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Baillie Gifford has launched a project exploring how to harness \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to improve the performance of its funds, becoming one of the first traditional investment companies to push into an area traditionally dominated by hedge funds.\par \par \uc2 The 109-year-old Scottish asset manager embarked on its AI mission six months ago, following in the footsteps of big hedge fund companies such as \uc2 Man Group\uc2  and \uc2 Winton Capital\uc2 , which have used \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques for years.\par \par \uc2 Baillie Gifford has hired a former mathematician to assist with the project, and has four internal staff from its IT and investment teams focused on the initiative. The goal is to assess whether AI can eliminate mundane tasks that take up fund managers\u8217\'20\'19 time, enabling them to investigate a wider range of potentially market-beating investment ideas.\par \par \uc2 The Edinburgh-based fund house, which tends to hold stocks for a minimum of five years, plans to assess whether AI has a discernible impact on fund performance before hiring more specialists in this area.\par \par \uc2 Despite its reputation as a traditional stockpicking asset manager, Baillie Gifford has been a sizeable and often early-stage investor in several cutting-edge technology companies, including Chinese conglomerates Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent; \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , the social networking site; and Amazon, the online retailer.\par \par \uc2 Kyle McEnery, an investment analyst at the fund house and a former physicist who is closely involved in the project, said the company felt compelled to explore the potential benefits of AI, given the \u8220\'20\'1Cexplosion of data and the increase in processing power\u8221\'20\'1D in recent years.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CConsidering we always look at things in the long term, understanding where things could go is something we should be doing,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1COur approach is helping our investors to do what they do better. We are breaking down the investment process and seeing if there are any areas where a computer would be helpful \u8212\'20\'14 if a human is wasting their time on an area when it would be better spent on a higher value task.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The fund house, which oversees \u163\'00\'A3145bn of assets, is testing algorithms that can scan for stocks that might suit a particular investment style. The global equity team might want to search for companies that generate a certain level of sales revenue or gross profits, have significant insider ownership and meet several other criteria.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe power of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  is you can put in much more than five criteria, and allow [a computer] the freedom to place different weights on the data you put in. [The algorithm could then] supply that team with a constant stream of research ideas, giving them much more competition in their process, which leads to deeper due diligence and debate,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr McEnery said.\par \par \uc2 The asset management arms of several banks and insurers, including \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  and \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 , have also been ahead of the curve in terms of exploring how AI could benefit their investment and sales teams.\par \par \uc2 A growing number of mainstream asset managers are looking to adopt AI to shore up their performance, according to Aldous Birchall, AI lead at PwC, the professional services firm.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSpecialised quant funds have been using this for a long time. What we are seeing now is a broader acceptance [of AI] across the traditional asset management industry,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt will enable them to do a lot more with the same resources: cover more companies and assess more opportunities.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170814ed8e000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc60}{\*\bkmkend toc60}\b \uc2 Fund managers deny AI threatens jobs; INVESTMENT STRATEGY\b0\par\par\uc2 By Madison Marriage \par \uc2 1,277 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2017\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 Surveys FNM1\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Industry believes \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will actually create more opportunities\par \par \uc2 A prestigious Boston-based consultancy issued a warning to the asset management industry this year: within the next seven years, more than 90,000 jobs in the sector would be eliminated by the rise of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Opimas, the company behind the prediction, said asset management would be worse affected than other areas of financial services, which is likely to lose 230,000 jobs overall by 2025. The consultancy estimates about 520,000 people work in the asset management industry globally.\par \par \uc2 Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of Opimas, says AI will lead to job cuts in the back office, operations and customer service. "Some portfolio managers feel that AI cannot replace them in the investment-decision process. However, we are already seeing this replacement occur," he says. "This is particularly true with a shift to passive investment strategies, where a surprising number of investment decisions are still handled by human portfolio managers. This is an area ready to be automated by AI."\par \par \uc2 However, fund companies fiercely deny that their growing use of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques, which help portfolio managers spot patterns in vast streams of data, will trigger a dramatic fall in headcount.\par \par \uc2 Although \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms have been used by computer-driven hedge funds for decades, Baillie Gifford is one of several mainstream fund managers that are turning to AI for the first time in a bid to boost returns.\par \par \uc2 Kyle McEnery, an investment analyst at the Scottish fund house, says his colleagues "had a long talk about jobs being under threat " when the project was in its early stages.\par \par \uc2 "The first very positive thing I would say is anything that we automate will only mean investors have more time doing much more valuable tasks and coming up with new ideas," he says.\par \par \uc2 Baillie Gifford has hired a mathematician to help with its AI project, which is being led by four staff from its IT and investment teams. The Edinburgh-based company will hire more specialists if it becomes "really obvious" the algorithms are improving investment performance, Mr McEnery adds.\par \par \uc2 A senior executive at a large hedge fund, speaking privately, says fears that widespread adoption of AI could result in mass redundancies for high-earning portfolio managers are misplaced.\par \par \uc2 "If you are executing small trades, I think most people would agree a machine is better at doing that. If you are trying to understand the prospects of a company by speaking to a new chief executive, at the moment, everyone would say a human is better at doing that," he says.\par \par \uc2 "It is about understanding what machines are better at. There are certain jobs that have been automated over the past 10 years. But I don't think the whole of finance will be automated away. AI removes some work, but creates different work."\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Asset Management, Germany's second-largest investment house, has also started investigating how to use AI to improve sales techniques and attract clients. The \u8364\'20\'AC711bn asset manager has exchanged data sets with several technology companies that specialise in AI analysis and will soon decide which provider to work with.\par \par \uc2 The Frankfurt-based company wants to use AI to introduce chatbots that can respond to simple questions from retail clients when they come to its website. It also wants to automate how it evaluates meeting reports filed by its thousands of sales staff to get a better indication of mass changes in client sentiment.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche AM additionally wants to sift through publicly available data on the performance of clients' investments with rival asset managers. This could, in theory, help it judge when best to approach clients about switching their money into better-performing funds.\par \par \uc2 Thorsten Michalik, head of distribution in Europe and Asia for Deutsche AM, denies that using \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to streamline these processes will hit headcount. "From the information generated by AI, we hope we will increase the size of our business, which will mean we need to hire more people," he says.\par \par \uc2 In Germany, only 15 per cent of the population invests in funds and stocks, he says. He believes AI will help Deutsche AM access the 70m Germans who have never invested, bringing more money into the company and increasing the need for more staff. Mr Michalik's team has three specialists focused on AI, and he expects this will triple over the next 12 months.\par \par \uc2 "We need to increase the size of the market. The only way we can do this is by using new technology. [Our] people understand this," he says.\par \par \uc2 The huge interest in AI has created jobs elsewhere across the sector. According to \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 , the professional networking website, there has been a surge in the number of financial services companies, including banks and asset managers, seeking data scientists over the past two years.\par \par \uc2 There are 6,300 data scientist jobs within financial services currently advertised on \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The number of roles advertised in the sector using the terms data scientist, \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  or \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , has more than tripled over the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Steve Cohen\uc2 's Point72, \uc2 Neuberger Berman\uc2  and Wellington Capital are among the large alternative investment managers that are looking to hire more data scientists to work alongside their investment teams.\par \par \uc2 Investors' growing interest in this area comes on the back of an explosion in the amount of data available online.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 Unigestion\uc2 , the Swiss asset manager, 90 per cent of available data has been created in the past three years, coming from a mix of sources, including weather sensors, social networks, satellite images, online transactions and GPS signals.\par \par \uc2 With the internet of things - everyday objects connected to the internet - forecast to grow from 8bn to 20bn devices by 2020, the number of data points will grow exponentially, the Geneva-based asset manager said in a recent research paper.\par \par \uc2 Other mainstream asset managers are also entering the fray. State Street Global Exchange, a division of \uc2 State Street\uc2 , the US custody bank and asset manager, is piloting a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  tool that aims to send alerts to large investors when news breaks that could hurt their portfolios. If a copper mine explodes in North America, for example, \uc2 State Street\uc2  could alert clients with large holdings in Apple to review their positions in the technology company, as it relies on the metal to make its iPhones.\par \par \uc2 Japan's Nomura Asset Management, said in June it had completed a project seeking to assess whether AI can improve the decision-making processes of its portfolio managers. The project, which was carried out with the \uc2 Nomura Research Institute\uc2 , a consultancy, involved systematically labelling data sources for fund managers, such as \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feeds, blogs or news announcements, as positive or negative.\par \par \uc2 This helped Nomura's investment teams to become "more efficient" and freed up their time to investigate more interesting investment ideas, according to a spokesman for the NRI.\par \par \uc2 Aldous Birchall, AI lead in the consulting business of PwC, the professional services firm, is more circumspect. He believes some portfolio manager roles will be eliminated as AI is adopted by traditional fund managers.\par \par \uc2 But he adds: "I would be really surprised to see an apocalypse. I don't think people will come into the office and be told they have been replaced by a robot. Rather than a team of 10 [portfolio managers running a fund], it will be a team of seven or eight, including a couple of data scientists.\par \par \uc2 "I often get asked - what's better, AI or human fund managers? The answer is the best team involves humans plus AI."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170814ed8e0000b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 WebMD\uc2  Wants to Go Beyond Medical Information; The site is aiming to be a place where health consumers can also take action\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ali Stratton \par \uc2 1,563 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2017\par 03:12\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Private Equity\par \uc2 RSTPROPE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 In the digital age, people seeking health-related assistance online have more options than ever before. Innovative technologies, as well as cloud computing and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  enable the newly medicalized smartphone to permeate every aspect of health care.\par \par \uc2 As a health information provider, \uc2 WebMD\uc2  is well aware of these changes. According to the company's chief financial officer, \uc2 Blake DeSimone\uc2 , who was appointed to the position in September, \uc2 WebMD\uc2  is in the process of transforming its flagship site for consumers, WebMD.com, from a one-stop shop for information to a platform people can engage with and take action to improve their health.\par \par \uc2 WebMD\uc2  last month agreed to be acquired by private-equity firm \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . for $2.8 billion, after publicly putting itself in play early this year. When announcing the deal, \uc2 WebMD\uc2  said the acquisition would provide flexibility and bolster its resources.\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeSimone, 40, joined \uc2 WebMD\uc2  in 2015 and previously served as senior vice president of finance until his appointment to the executive position.\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Mr. DeSimone, while declining to talk about the pending acquisition, spoke about transparency, expansion to new interfaces, and how \uc2 WebMD\uc2  is leveraging its formidable customer base to make advancements in the digital age. Edited excerpts follow:\par \par \uc2 WSJ: According to \uc2 WebMD\uc2 , 75 million people turn to it each month for medical information. How does \uc2 WebMD\uc2  ensure that the advice it gives is accurate and people can trust it?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: It really manifests itself in two ways. One, being independent. On Medscape and \uc2 WebMD\uc2  we have complete separation between our editorial teams and our commercial teams internally so advertisers will never have an influence on the content created by the editorial teams. The second priority there is transparency. We are a publisher, so there are places on the sites where there is advertiser-sponsored content, and to the extent that there is that content it is labeled as such.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Let's talk about how technology is transforming health care in the digital age. People can now reach doctors through their phones and get instant medical advice. Is that \uc2 WebMD\uc2 's competition?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: Over the course of the last 20 years \uc2 WebMD\uc2  has been a place where consumers and patients and caregivers go to get content, but once they get that content they have to go somewhere else to take the next step in managing their health. We're working to transition the platform to be more than just a place where you get information to a place where you take action.\par \par \uc2 We're in the middle of that evolution right now. No one has the scale that we have right now. So it's up to us to transition the asset to provide these other services so that we can improve the engagement with our audiences.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Can you list specific changes \uc2 WebMD\uc2  is making to enable its customers to take action?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: We can build upon products like our symptom checkers and provide our customers a variety of services like booking a doctor, ordering a lab test or having a telemedicine visit.\par \par \uc2 If a customer was searching for information on a certain condition and then read something on \uc2 WebMD\uc2  that motivated them to want to speak with a doctor, in the future, we'll provide that person with the option of scheduling an appointment or engaging in a telemedicine visit. There could be a link on the page, or a window that would come up, but it would be available to them right on the page they're reading. As you go through the symptom checker experience, the same options would be available.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Could \uc2 WebMD\uc2 's transition from an information source to a place to take action create revenue-producing opportunities for the company?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: Yes. Currently, all of the revenue that we generate on \uc2 WebMD\uc2  and Medscape are advertising and sponsorship based. As we move to areas where consumers can take action, we do believe that presents a new transactional revenue stream to the company.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Does \uc2 WebMD\uc2  believe insurance will cover the expenses patients will incur by using the platform to take action?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: We plan to help them understand potential costs. And that includes whether or not it's covered by insurance. We will provide customers with billing information that they can submit to their insurance company for reimbursement. In the future we will explore relationships with providers to make a seamless and transparent process for consumers.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Some doctors could see \uc2 WebMD\uc2  inserting itself between them and their patients, in its efforts to help customers to take action. What do you think about that?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: Seventy percent of customers who visit \uc2 WebMD\uc2  for information about a disease or condition actually make an appointment to see their doctor within 30 days. If we can make it easier for customers to make an appointment with a doctor or schedule a telemedicine visit, it's good for consumers and for doctors. We're not looking to interrupt that relationship at all. We're just giving them additional options. Ultimately, it's up to a consumer to make the decision that's right for them.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: With the opportunity to point people to specific products or services, how will \uc2 WebMD\uc2  ensure that its customers understand they aren't getting impartial advice?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: Trust with our audience is something that \uc2 WebMD\uc2  has been known for, so we need to maintain that trust. Our editorial team is separate from our commercial teams. All the information we provide is independent. We expect to continue to be independent and not necessarily endorse one telemedicine vendor or lab-test vendor versus another. In cases where we did do that, we would be completely transparent and identify that as being branded by a specific vendor.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Tell me about some of the new platforms \uc2 WebMD\uc2  is expanding to, from its traditional website.\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: According to Gartner, 30% of web browsing sessions will be done without a screen, through alternative interfaces by 2020. We are doing that through Amazon Alexa and Google Home and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  messenger. \uc2 WebMD\uc2  will respond with physician-reviewed answers, and basically all of the information we currently have on the site will be available through these platforms. We want to make our content available to all audiences wherever they are to get access to health-related information.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: How is \uc2 WebMD\uc2  using \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: Over the last couple of years we've made significant investments in research and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  resources and teams so we can improve the \uc2 WebMD\uc2  experience.\par \par \uc2 A good example of how we've leveraged data for customers is the work we've done with \uc2 Reckitt Benckiser\uc2  for cold and flu. \uc2 WebMD\uc2  now publishes interactive cold and flu maps annually to present real-time analysis of the spread of cold and flu. We can now predict cold and flu trends up to four weeks in advance. It leverages various data sources we have including those from \uc2 WebMD\uc2 's symptom checker. The data we collect informs [\uc2 Reckitt Benckiser\uc2 's] media and marketing plans and it's really invaluable to them.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: How does \uc2 Reckitt Benckiser\uc2  use this information to its advantage?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: \uc2 WebMD\uc2 's proprietary models in the cold and flu map are able to predict cold and flu trends in advance. \uc2 Reckitt Benckiser\uc2  then uses those insights to target specific products like Mucinex for users with the symptoms that are most prevalent in a given geography. If nasal congestion is at a high level in New York City, \uc2 Reckitt Benckiser\uc2  might trigger an ad for their Mucinex Sinus Max. Or, if cough and chest congestion is prevalent in San Francisco, they might trigger an ad for Mucinex Expectorant. They're all over-the-counter products. And the campaign is conducted on a completely de-identified basis and the ads they deliver are based solely on geography, so it's not targeting an individual.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: \uc2 WebMD\uc2  has a reputation of scaring people who turn to it for medical questions. What is the company doing to overcome that?\par \par \uc2 MR. DESIMONE: Currently we correlate visitors' symptoms with possible medical conditions based in part on the prevalence rate. The new version of our symptom checker that's launching this summer does two things. It's easier to enter symptoms and it will leverage an even larger library of symptoms and possible conditions.\par \par \uc2 It uses a "match strength" rating system of weak, fair, moderate or strong, to help audiences determine the likelihood of a given condition and give perspective for what the right next step is.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stratton is a Wall Street Journal reporter in New York.

The London firm will target \u8364\'20\'AC300 million ($353.5 million) for the vehicle\u8212\'20\'14nearly as much as the \u8364\'20\'AC370 million it has raised to date, according to its website.\par \par \uc2 Double the Size\par \par \uc2 C5 Capital, another London firm that invests both private equity and venture capital in data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and cybersecurity companies, plans to return to market with a third fund before the end of 2017, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm is expected to target approximately $200 million for the vehicle, nearly double the size of its first fund.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the firm will also start raising capital for a $150 million vehicle to invest in cloud computing companies and software sellers, imminently, a separate person said. In 2015, the firm partnered with \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2  for a cloud-based accelerator program.\par \par \uc2 These fundraising plans come as appetite for technology investment has soared in recent months\u8212\'20\'14pushing some price multiples to above 20 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation\u8212\'20\'14and coincide with a surge in fundraising for information technology-focused strategies.\par \par \uc2 HgCapital said in February it had closed a \u163\'00\'A32.5 billion core fundraising effort alongside its \u163\'00\'A3575 million HgCapital Mercury II fund, both of which invest in technology and technology-enabled services. \uc2 Vitruvian Partners\uc2 , which has invested in travel fare aggregator \uc2 Skyscanner Ltd\uc2 . and software asset management technology provider Snow Software, said in June it had raised about \u8364\'20\'AC2.4 billion, hitting its hard cap.\par \par \uc2 Recently established firm Volpi Capital, which was set up by \uc2 3i Group PLC\uc2 's former head of technology, media and telecommunications Crevan O'Grady, began talks with investors late last year to raise a \u8364\'20\'AC300 million fund to invest in European businesses.\par \par \uc2 "There's growth because they're taking market share," said Adam Turtle, a partner at private-equity advisory \uc2 Rede Partners LLP\uc2 . He added that health-care and tech "would fit under the defensive tech segment", insulating them from economic cycles.\par \par \uc2 Software is eating the world, the saying goes, and private-equity firms are investing in software-as-a-service companies structured around cloud-based services with aplomb.\par \par \uc2 Congested Space\par \par \uc2 Andrew Ferguson\uc2 , managing director at Baird Capital Partners Europe, described private equity\u8212\'20\'14particularly in the lower to midmarket, as "a congested space".\par \par \uc2 His firm invests in technology only "where it powers service companies", such as IT service providers, rather than investing in technology manufacturers.\par \par \uc2 Research provider Preqin Ltd. said in its 2017 Global Private Equity and Venture Capital report that funds focused on the IT sector were targeting among "the largest sums of capital" of all funds in the asset class, amounting to a total of $29 billion in aggregate as of April.\par \par \uc2 Strong appetite to invest in the sector comes as the line between private equity and venture capital is blurring. Private-equity firms are investing growth capital in revenue-generating companies and venture-capital funds are getting larger.\par \par \uc2 Appetite for investment in European technology was kickstarted when \uc2 Skype Technologies SA\uc2 , one of the region's first unicorns, filed to list on the public markets in 2010 and sold to \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . for $8.5 billion a year later.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jessica Davies at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jessica.davies@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jessica.davies@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20170814ed8e000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

He recently indicated he's still looking for political cover to follow through with his plan.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Watt is facing a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation that has no easy answers.\par \par \uc2 At issue are the mortgage-finance giants' ultra-thin capital levels, which will drop to zero in January under the terms of their federal bailouts. As a result, should the companies suffer an operating loss, they would have no capital to absorb it and would be forced to draw on their $258 billion government backstop. That would be interpreted as yet another bailout for the companies and, according to Mr. Watt, could trigger "adverse" market consequences.\par \par \uc2 To avoid that scenario, Mr. Watt has said he might {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-senators-put-fannie-freddie-overhaul-back-in-play-1494495000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 order the companies to retain earnings rather than to continue sending them}}}\uc2  to the Treasury Department (as they currently do under the terms of their bailouts). But so far he's received {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mnuchin-expects-fannie-and-freddie-to-keep-sending-profits-to-the-us-treasury-2017-05-18"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 no political support from the Trump administration or key congressional Republicans}}}\uc2  to make such a change.\par \par \uc2 (Meanwhile, the companies {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fannie-freddie-signal-possible-payment-delay-as-debt-ceiling-looms-1501795451"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 signaled earlier this month}}}\uc2  that they might not make their quarterly dividend payment to Treasury at the end of September\u8212\'20\'14a move that could divert about $5 billion from federal coffers just as the government's debt ceiling needs to be raised.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Watt seems now to acknowledge he's stuck: He wants to order the companies to begin to build up their capital buffers, but there are significant political pitfalls for doing do.\par \par \uc2 "I have publicly expressed my concerns that the declining capital buffers leave the enterprises with little or no ability to absorb losses," he wrote the \uc2 National Association of Realtors\uc2  last week. "However, I am sensitive to the prospect that whatever steps FHFA could take might be misperceived as either an effort to promote recapitalization and release of the enterprises [from government control] or as interference with Congress's important work to advance housing finance reform."\par \par \uc2 To be sure, Mr. Watt didn't rule out eventually requiring the companies to retain their profits, but his letter suggests he is eager to see some political momentum to back such a move, saying he will "continue to look for ways to ensure that the concerns I have expressed are addressed constructively."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Watt is an Obama-administration appointee whose term expires in January 2019.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. Watt declined to comment on the letter, which came in response to a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://narfocus.com/billdatabase/clientfiles/172/3/2925.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Realtor-backed plan to allow the mortgage-finance firms to begin retaining some of their profits}}}\uc2  while Congress deliberates on how to refashion them. The \uc2 National Association of Realtors\uc2  says allowing the companies to retain some of their earnings would create a buffer between any losses and taxpayers, who would be on the hook should the companies need to draw on their Treasury backstop.\par \par \uc2 William Brown, the group's president, said in a written statement that his members "appreciate" Mr. Watt's attention to the issue.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Trump Chips Away at Postcrisis Wall Street Rules\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy and Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 Efforts toward financial deregulation are beginning to take concrete shape on rules governing trading desks, bank boardrooms, corporations' financial disclosures and more. Nearly seven months into the Trump administration, regulators are setting the stage for a wave of eased rules.\par \par \uc2 Several agencies are reviewing the Volcker rule, a part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that limits banks' trading. Some regulators also recently dropped a plan to restrict bonuses on Wall Street that had been opposed by banks and brokerage firms. And the Labor Department on Wednesday disclosed an 18-month delay in the so-called fiduciary rule that requires brokers to act in retirement savers' best interests rather than their own.\par \par \uc2 The moves show that while President Donald Trump is struggling to advance his legislative agenda in Congress, his administration has begun laying the groundwork to change some of the myriad rules that Wall Street has sought for years to overturn or water down.\par \par \uc2 "On most topics, we are still awaiting the approval of appointees, but it is encouraging that there are some issues, some of which are technical but incredibly important to running a bank, where some progress is being made," said \uc2 Greg Baer\uc2 , president of the Clearing House Association of large banks.\par \par \uc2 "It is a time to\u8230\'20\'26determine where the pendulum has gone too far," Craig Phillips, counselor to U.S. Treasury Secretary \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2 , told a government-advisory committee July 20 at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Phillips, a former investment banker and senior executive at BlackRock Inc., has been leading the administration's effort to identify changes to financial rules. He was a principal author of a Treasury Department report released in June that recommended 97 policies in the lending sector for Congress and regulators to re-examine. More reports are coming, covering other sectors.\par \par \uc2 So far, the rule book for Wall Street hasn't been rewritten in major ways, in part because nominees for some key posts haven't been named or are awaiting Senate confirmation. But officials who are in place are laying the groundwork.\par \par \uc2 Those efforts are triggering pushback about whether they would undermine protections adopted after the 2008 bank bailouts. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has said many of the proposals amount to "weakening or eliminating important safeguards."\par \par \uc2 "Big banks are making record profits, yet they claim they're besieged by their watchdogs," he said last month.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Baer calls the changes under consideration "an effort to rethink things in a cogent way."\par \par \uc2 Partisan tensions on Capitol Hill will make it difficult to make changes through legislation, meaning some items on the industry's wish list, such as full repeal of the Volcker rule, are unlikely. But that inertia doesn't restrict agency officials, who typically have broad discretion on how to implement rules that stem from legislation Congress has passed.\par \par \uc2 The current regulatory agenda of the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , published in July, removed more than a dozen proposals related to Dodd-Frank, including the plan to restrict bonuses.\par \par \uc2 The commission's Trump-nominated chairman, Jay Clayton, has said he wants to lighten the regulatory burden on public companies, which are required to make public filings to keep shareholders informed about financial performance, business trends and potential risks.\par \par \uc2 He hasn't taken action to scale back those rules yet, but his predecessor Michael Piwowar, a Republican SEC commissioner tapped by Mr. Trump to serve as acting chairman until Mr. Clayton was confirmed, started work toward changing two rules. One requires disclosure of the pay gap between chief executives and workers, and another requires companies to investigate whether their products include minerals from African countries where mining can benefit armed groups. Any significant changes to the rules would require an opportunity for public comment and a commission vote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, in remarks last month to the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , also questioned whether small shareholders are abusing an election process that allows them to seek changes to corporate bylaws.\par \par \uc2 A more radical SEC step under study is how to revise the rules for who can invest in private companies. U.S. law allows companies to issue stock with little regulatory oversight as long as all investors qualify as wealthy or sophisticated enough to understand the risk or withstand potential losses. But Mr. Piwowar has questioned the restriction, saying it walls off sought-after investments for the rich.\par \par \uc2 The SEC and the four other federal agencies that wrote the Volcker rule agreed in recent weeks to give banks leeway on aspects of the regulation while beginning private discussions about how to rewrite it.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , the chief agency that regulates federally chartered banks and which is temporarily led by a Trump appointee, took the first tangible step toward potentially rewriting the rule when it reopened it for comments from the public.\par \par \uc2 In early August, the Senate confirmed three of Mr. Trump's nominees to the U.S. derivatives regulator, the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 , including Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo. That representation will strengthen the commission's ability to carry out Mr. Giancarlo's desired revamp of postcrisis rules governing the swaps market.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump in July announced his pick for the vacant job of Federal Reserve vice chairman in charge of bank oversight. The nominee, financier and former Treasury Department official Randal Quarles, has said he would support reviews of the Volcker rule as well as the central bank's annual stress tests of large banks.\par \par \uc2 Staffers at the Fed already are taking a fresh look at a bank-capital rule known as the leverage ratio, a move long sought by the largest U.S. banks, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 And the Fed in August proposed scaling back requirements it places on banks' boards of directors, after determining it was overloading boards with too many specific requirements.\par \par \uc2 Not all the action is deregulatory. The new CFTC commissioners recently vowed to finish a position-limits rule to limit speculation in commodity markets, a regulation mandated by Dodd-Frank.\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 , still led by an Obama appointee, in early July restricted mandatory arbitration in financial contracts, making it easier for consumers to sue financial companies. That rule won't last if enough Republicans in the Senate vote to repeal it in the coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Gabriel T. Rubin contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Investors Take On Mortgage Risk From Taxpayers\par \par \uc2 By Sam Goldfarb\par \par \uc2 Investors are snapping up a new type of security sold by \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , increasingly assuming the risks of mortgage defaults from taxpayers and powering a quiet transformation of the housing giants after almost a decade of government control.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie have sold roughly $48 billion of the securities since 2013 to a broadening group of buyers including asset managers and insurance companies. Sales are expected to reach a fresh high of $15 billion this year, up from the previous record $13 billion last year, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The sales mark an early step toward reducing the government's role in the $14.4 trillion U.S. mortgage market. The amount of mortgage debt funneled through Fannie and Freddie and other taxpayer-backed entities roughly doubled after the financial crisis, to around 70%.\par \par \uc2 The progress has come despite a long-running stalemate in Congress, which has stumbled in its effort to design a replacement for the decades-old housing-finance system that centers on Fannie and Freddie.\par \par \uc2 It may not be happening as people anticipated, but "the government's footprint in the mortgage market is receding quickly and significantly," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The market for the so-called credit-risk transfers has boomed even as the one for privately issued mortgage-backed securities has remained mostly dormant, a sign that investors have greater comfort in the standards and transparency of these deals than in those issued by Wall Street banks that performed so poorly after the housing bust.\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie don't make loans. They buy them from lenders and bundle them into securities. Those bonds typically carry a guarantee that Fannie and Freddie will pay investors if underlying mortgages default, leaving investors only with the risk that the bonds will lose value if interest rates rise.\par \par \uc2 The credit-risk transfers don't carry that guarantee. Nevertheless, they have proved popular with investors, who have concluded that the yields they offer are worth the added risk. As the market has developed, banks have also been willing to trade them, easing concerns that they would need to offer premium yields because they would be difficult for buyers to offload.\par \par \uc2 Reflecting the strong interest, the average yield that investors have demanded to hold one version of the instrument has fallen by more than half in just two years, to roughly 1.5 percentage points on top of a benchmark floating interest rate, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.\par \par \uc2 The pool of investors buying the securities is also widening to what many consider more stable sources of capital, a sign of their changing status. While hedge funds made up the largest group of early investors, that distinction now belongs to more traditional money managers, according to J.P. Morgan Securities. Though still small players in the market, insurance companies and real-estate investment trusts have also increased their buying in some recent deals.\par \par \uc2 Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle, said he bought both Fannie and Freddie risk-transfers for the firm's Strategic Income Fund and then sold them as the market rallied.\par \par \uc2 "Liquidity has definitely improved as more securities have been issued," he said.\par \par \uc2 The mortgage giants are transferring risk on the loans most likely to default\u8212\'20\'14those of more than 20 years where homeowners have made less than a 40% down payment. Last year such mortgages accounted for 60% of all single-family mortgages they acquired, according to the \uc2 Federal Housing Finance Agency\uc2 , which oversees the firms.\par \par \uc2 How much risk Fannie and Freddie have shed depends in part on the severity of defaults. In a normal economic expansion, investors would likely shoulder around 20% of the losses in the mortgages underlying the securities, according to a new report by Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But that number would jump to around 60% to 70% if there was another severe recession comparable to the last one\u8212\'20\'14enough, if the firms were private, to possibly avoid a federal bailout, according to the \uc2 Moody's\uc2  report, which was written by analysts including Mr. Zandi.\par \par \uc2 The variability is a result of the securities' structure. Each comprises several tranches, linked to a pool of mortgages, with losses from defaults hitting the bottom tranche first and the top tranche last.\par \par \uc2 On almost all securities, Fannie and Freddie still own the riskiest and the safest tranches, seeing it as uneconomical to sell them to investors. That means they are exposed to mild losses, largely shielded from moderate to severe losses, but vulnerable again once defaults reach a catastrophic level.\par \par \uc2 The securities are one part of a larger government effort to revamp the housing giants. Since being placed under conservatorship in 2008\u8212\'20\'14when then-Treasury Secretary \uc2 Henry Paulson\uc2  said the government had a responsibility to address their systemic risk\u8212\'20\'14the firms have adopted a more stable business model by shrinking their once massive investment portfolios and raising the fees they charge lenders to guarantee mortgages. They have also joined forces to build a common system for securitizing home loans that could ultimately be used by other firms.\par \par \uc2 The securities aren't without controversy. Some observers have expressed concerns that Fannie and Freddie are paying investors too much for the risk they're shedding. Investors could also demand sharply higher yields in a market downturn, forcing Fannie and Freddie to either stop selling the securities, increasing their exposure to future defaults, or raise fees they charge lenders, potentially making home loans more expensive.\par \par \uc2 The securities have been also been drawn into a larger debate about what the government should do with Fannie and Freddie, which stand in limbo between the public and private sectors\u8212\'20\'14sending nearly all of their profits to the \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  despite reporting quarterly earnings and having outstanding shares.\par \par \uc2 Some of the securities' strongest advocates include those who want the companies to be dismantled, replaced with a larger number of private firms or a single, government-run utility, which they say would disperse risk and avoid another taxpayer-funded bailout.\par \par \uc2 Many shareholders, however, want to preserve the companies in near their current form while releasing them from conservatorship. One group has funded a proposal that would provide incentives for the institutions to issue risk transfers without mandating them.\par \par \uc2 Risk-transfers are a useful tool, said Landon Parsons, a senior adviser at \uc2 Moelis & Company\uc2 , which created the plan, but they "may not be available during a business cycle downturn at a reasonable cost."\par \par \uc2 Fiduciary Rule Casualty: Brokers' Mutual-Fund Offerings\par \par \uc2 By Daisy Maxey\par \par \uc2 Is less more when it comes to investor choice? That's the question facing brokerage firms and investment advisers as they look to comply with a landmark retirement-savings rule.\par \par \uc2 Large brokerage firms typically offer thousands of mutual funds to clients. But compliance demands of the fiduciary rule, which began to take effect in June and requires stewards of tax-advantaged retirement savings to act in clients' best interests rather than their own, are causing some firms to review their offerings.\par \par \uc2 Conducting the due diligence and documentation required on so many investments can be onerous, and under the rule, some firms may face increased litigation risks. As a result, brokerages may remove some funds\u8212\'20\'14including those with higher fees or those that present perceived risks\u8212\'20\'14from their sales platforms.\par \par \uc2 "If you have more than 5,000 mutual funds on your platform, that oversight is a lot of work," said Alma Piscitello, executive vice president of Northern Lights Distributors, which provides underwriting services and counsels investment managers on fund distribution.\par \par \uc2 Some brokerage and advisory firms have already told Northern Lights of funds being pulled from brokerage platforms because of the fiduciary rule, generally because of size or expense, Ms. Piscitello said.\par \par \uc2 Under the Obama-era regulation, which aims to eliminate conflicted advice that can arise based on incentives to sell financial products, those offering financial advice to retirement savers may earn commissions and compensation that might give them an incentive to recommend one product over another, but must do so under an exemption. For advisers who use the exemption, any fees must be level with similar investment products or services. That has put mutual funds, with their varying share classes and costs, under the spotlight.\par \par \uc2 Advocates of the rule say weeding out high-cost or risky funds would benefit investors. But some managers fear the fund review will cause sales of their products to suffer and that fund expenses may be used as the key metric in the process, while financial advisers worry that funds they've used in clients' portfolios for years will be discontinued.\par \par \uc2 USA Financial\uc2  hasn't cut any funds from its brokerage platform, but the Michigan-based financial-services firm has vetted its investment offerings with the fiduciary rule in mind, said Matt McGrew, the firm's chief operations officer.\par \par \uc2 If nothing changes and the rule takes full effect in January as planned, \uc2 USA Financial\uc2  anticipates cutting its more than 350 sales agreements across mutual funds, variable annuities, alternative investment and asset managers to "well less than 150," Mr. McGrew said.\par \par \uc2 But the rule remains in flux, with the Labor Department on Wednesday proposing to delay the compliance deadline by 18 months, which experts say suggests the rule still may undergo significant revisions.\par \par \uc2 Mark Travis, president and chief executive of Intrepid Capital Management in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., said some advisers who have sold his funds for years told him recently their firms plan to stop. Clients who already have money invested in Intrepid's funds will be able to stay invested, the advisers said, but no new money will be allowed on some brokerage platforms after the rule takes full effect.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Travis said one adviser is pushing back, telling his home office that he wants to continue offering Intrepid's funds as portfolio protection for clients. But, Mr. Travis said, the adviser has been told to have "a plan B" ready.\par \par \uc2 Investor shares of Intrepid's flagship $421.9 million \uc2 Intrepid Capital Fund\uc2  have an expense ratio of 1.4% compared with 0.91% for the median fund in its category, according to \uc2 Morningstar Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "That's a significant fee hurdle," said Jason Kephart, a senior analyst at Morningstar. Still, the fund's long-term performance has been solid, he added. The fund, which focuses on protecting investors' capital, lost just 16.7% in 2008 during the financial crisis as its average peer shed 28%.\par \par \uc2 Among bigger brokerages cutting fund offerings, some cite the fiduciary rule as impetus while others say it's simply part of regular due diligence.\par \par \uc2 LPL Financial\uc2  said it plans to launch a new mutual-fund platform early next year to standardize advisers' compensation to comply with the rule. The platform will offer fewer fund families than its existing platform and limit upfront commissions and trailing fees, or annual commissions.\par \par \uc2 Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit last year trimmed its mutual-fund offerings to 2,200 from 3,500, and expects to cut that number to 1,800 by year's end. The move is part of an enhanced due-diligence process and regular evaluation of its lineup, and not related to the fiduciary rule, a spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 Advisers who are using funds that have been cut from fee-based accounts can keep their existing positions, the spokeswoman said, but must do so within commission-based accounts and won't be permitted to add new assets.\par \par \uc2 To comply with the fiduciary rule, Merrill has shifted to fee-based retirement accounts with some limited exceptions.\par \par \uc2 Advocates of the rule had hoped it would lead to a re-evaluation of investment offerings. The Obama administration said its goal in pursuing the rule was to protect unwitting individual investors from conflicted advice, which it said costs American families billions of dollars a year and pushes down annual returns on their retirement savings.\par \par \uc2 "It was always a feature of this rule that it was going to force investment products to compete under a best-interest standard instead of competing to be sold by paying the broker more generously," said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America. "Forcing investment products to compete based on cost and quality will be best for investors, even if every decision made in narrowing these fund menus doesn't optimize the outcome."\par \par \uc2 Search Is On for Top Audit Regulator\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14One of the highest-paying jobs in regulating Wall Street is about to be open\u8212\'20\'14and the boss is taking applications.\par \par \uc2 U.S. officials are looking to hire a new chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a little-known body that oversees the country's largest accounting firms and their audits of public companies and broker-dealers, according to a statement issued Friday. The role, created by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law, pays more than $670,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 The PCAOB, as it is known, is a nonprofit regulator that is overseen by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . The SEC's commissioners also pick the audit regulator's chairman and other members of its board. The term of the current chairman, James Doty, expired in October 2015, but he stayed in the role because SEC commissioners didn't act to replace him.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's announcement said it is seeking a successor to Mr. Doty, indicating he won't be reappointed. Mr. Doty has led the body since 2011 and sometimes clashed with the biggest audit firms over proposals that sought to shine more light on the behind-the-scenes work of auditors. In June, for instance, the accounting board approved a rule that requires auditors to disclose more about any "critical audit matters"\u8212\'20\'14areas of their audit that were especially challenging or complex or forced them to make tough decisions in evaluating a company's books.\par \par \uc2 Congress set relatively lofty salaries for the audit regulator's board members to attract qualified candidates from the legal and accounting fields. Board members at the agency make about $546,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 Seats on the audit regulator are especially attractive to lawyers and accountants in Washington, D.C., who have toiled at government agencies where they earn far less.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Doty had a mixed record as chairman. Business groups sometimes complained his inspectors were too tough on audit firms. He was also forced several years ago to retreat from an idea to make companies rotate their auditors after several years.\par \par \uc2 The SEC briefly considered replacing Mr. Doty in September 2015, just before his term expired. At the time, the candidates for the job included William Duhnke, a top Republican staff member on the Senate Banking Committee.

The moves, most coming in recent months, are prompting questions from market participants about who holds power at these companies, and whether they will be run for the benefit of investors.\par \par \uc2 The changes follow directives from Beijing, which has been pushing to establish the Communist Party's role in corporate charters on the mainland. They make explicit what many had already assumed: that China's ruling party\u8212\'20\'14the country's sole governing authority despite the existence of several other political parties\u8212\'20\'14keeps a tight grip on the country's state-owned firms. Those firms now make up the bulk of Hong Kong's market.\par \par \uc2 For the past two decades, Beijing has listed the stocks and bonds of its state-owned enterprises in Hong Kong\u8212\'20\'14the offshore finance center with a separate business-friendly legal system\u8212\'20\'14as a means of raising capital from global investors to fuel China's economic expansion.\par \par \uc2 The companies now placing their boards under Party guidance include some of the biggest listed in Hong Kong, with a combined market capitalization of 9.7 trillion Hong Kong dollars\u8212\'20\'14almost a third of the total value of stocks listed on the city's exchange.\par \par \uc2 They include China's biggest bank, \uc2 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China\uc2 , its largest brokerage, \uc2 Citic Securities\uc2 , and oil-and-gas giant \uc2 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp\uc2 ., better known as Sinopec.\par \par \uc2 Many of the companies have passed amendments to their corporate structures and others are being put to shareholder vote in the next few weeks.\par \par \uc2 "When making decisions on significant matters, the Board shall seek advice from the Party committee of the Company," reads the amended article of association of Beijing-based engineering contractor China Machinery Engineering Corp.\par \par \uc2 Not all big state-owned enterprises have changed their charters. \uc2 PetroChina Co\uc2 ., the listed unit of China's biggest oil company, whose shares trade in Shanghai, Hong Kong and New York, hasn't done so. \uc2 PetroChina\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 So far, the Hong Kong stock market has largely ignored the moves, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 22% this year and hovering near a two-year high.\par \par \uc2 The stocks and bonds those companies issue comprise a major chunk of some benchmarks widely used by global investors, such as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The development is making some fund managers uneasy.\par \par \uc2 These latest disclosures provide "more questions than answers," said Jamie Grant, head of Asia fixed income at First State Investments. Mr. Grant said his firm has been assessing whether the changes affect the value of some of their stock and bond portfolios, since they noticed the amendments quietly being implemented this summer.\par \par \uc2 If the changes reflect an advance in Chinese President Xi Jinping's corruption crackdown, they may ultimately benefit investors, Mr. Grant said. Alternatively, they could be part of an attempt by the Communist Party to curb high debt levels, he added.\par \par \uc2 Outspoken private investor and former Hong Kong stock exchange director David Webb is more critical.\par \par \uc2 Making the Communist Party's role official provides companies "with cover to follow party instructions and reduces the chance that they will prioritize shareholder value," Mr. Webb wrote in an email. "It underlines the falsity of [Chinese] leaders' claims to be \u8216\'20\'18letting market forces play a greater role' and \u8216\'20\'18deepening reforms.'"\par \par \uc2 None of the Chinese companies that disclosed these changes responded to requests for comment. The Chinese body that oversees state enterprises, State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC, wasn't available to comment.\par \par \uc2 The amendments underscore the growing dominance of mainland companies and capital in Hong Kong. Mainland investors have flooded into Hong Kong's property market and are buying up an increasing proportion of the stock market via new trading links with Shanghai and Shenzhen.\par \par \uc2 Chinese government agencies have also blocked accountancy firms in Hong Kong from producing mainland-company documents that have been requested by regulators in other countries, citing national secrecy concerns.\par \par \uc2 President Xi Jinping is pushing the Communist Party to take a more visible leadership role in society, with state-owned enterprises at the forefront. Two years ago, the government called for "strengthened Party leadership and improved corporate governance" and to enshrine the Party's role in corporate charters.\par \par \uc2 SASAC ordered state firms under central government control to make the changes by June end, while local governments are giving companies they control until the end of the year to comply.\par \par \uc2 The push has accelerated since April, Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange filings indicate. Several of the Hong Kong-listed companies that have mandated the creation of Communist Party committees said their boards would take into account the opinions of those committees "before making decisions on major matters." Some stated that the chairman of the board and the secretary of the Party committee should be the same person. Many of the companies also established disciplinary committees to police corruption.\par \par \uc2 China Aluminum International Engineering Corp\uc2 . stated in its amended articles of association that its Communist Party committee would help create "an effective system under which no one dares to, or can be corrupted, or thinks of committing corruption."\par \par \uc2 One portfolio manager at a global investment firm expressed concern about the involvement of Party members in the corporate decision-making process, particularly since they might not have the best interests of the company or its shareholders in mind. Valuations could suffer as a result, he said.\par \par \uc2 As a group, the 32 companies that have allowed the Communist party greater influence currently are valued roughly 24% cheaper than the Hang Seng Index.\par \par \uc2 But shareholders of state companies who object to the increased Communist Party influence can't do much about it. Most state-owned enterprises are majority-owned by Beijing, which has enough voting rights to force through the changes.\par \par \uc2 Hong Kong's market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, declined to comment on the trend.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for \uc2 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing\uc2 , the city's stock market operator, said the Chinese state firms were following listing rules, though it had noted some "minor variations" in their articles of association.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Fanfan Wang and Yifan Xie contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Ex-Trader Seeks Redemption for \u8216\'20\'18Intellectual Grift'\par \par \uc2 By Matt Wirz\par \par \uc2 "God it smells like dead animal in here," says Chris Arnade, a former bond trader, as he opens the doors of his battered minivan in an attempt to clear the baked-in stink.\par \par \uc2 It's 105 degrees in the parking lot of a Bakersfield, Calif., \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  on a recent Saturday. Homeless men and women pass by on their way to get breakfast, free ice or to sit in the air conditioning.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arnade walked away from Wall Street after 20 years to photograph and write about America's disaffected poor. His work, especially on how economic inequality contributed to Donald Trump's political ascent, has garnered a large following of fans\u8212\'20\'14and detractors\u8212\'20\'14across the political spectrum.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arnade's unusual bipartisan appeal\u8212\'20\'14both Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton and billionaire Democratic fundraiser Chris Sacca invited him to lunch this spring\u8212\'20\'14reflects the contradictions of a life spent straddling social and economic divides.\par \par \uc2 He grew up lower middle class in the rural south, where his family stuck out for its civil rights activism. He made millions on Wall Street from what he calls "intellectual grift," while spending his days arguing for liberal economic changes with conservative co-workers.\par \par \uc2 The 52-year-old Mr. Arnade says the new career is a conscious attempt to reconcile his multiple identities, and perhaps atone for his time in finance.\par \par \uc2 "This is more comfortable to me," he says, waving his hand at the foot traffic around the Bakersfield \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 . "This is what I grew up with."\par \par \uc2 Tall and unshaven with shoulder-length graying hair, Mr. Arnade has swapped his trader's khakis and button-down shirts for jeans and T-shirts, usually worn several days in a row. He radiates frenetic energy, walking everywhere at a rapid clip and conversing in a hopscotch that jumps from one topic to another.\par \par \uc2 Most nights on the road he sleeps in the van or at cut-rate motels. He woke to yelling on a recent night at a Bakersfield Days Inn and found police officers investigating a murder across the hall.\par \par \uc2 "I peeked into the room and there was a lot of blood," Mr. Arnade says. "Then I went back to bed."\par \par \uc2 The journey from bond trader to the Bakersfield parking lot began in a ramshackle house in San Antonio, Fla. Mr. Arnade's father, a Jewish university professor who escaped Nazi Germany, and mother, a socialist activist, raised him and six siblings in the conservative, Catholic town.\par \par \uc2 There he played high-school football and baseball and learned to shoot guns. But he was also teased for his bookishness and called a "n\u8212\'20\'14 lover," he says. His parents skimped on new clothes and car repairs so they could take the family on far-flung academic research trips and all of the children went to college, a rarity in San Antonio at the time, he says.\par \par \uc2 "Being caught in the middle you end up something of a watcher," says Mr. Arnade. "You never fit in entirely."\par \par \uc2 He also felt like an outsider on Wall Street, where he landed in 1993 after receiving a doctorate in particle physics from \uc2 Johns Hopkins University\uc2 , borrowing money to buy the suit he needed for his interview with Salomon Smith Barney.\par \par \uc2 "He was very rural Florida and different from anyone else we were working with, these lacrosse players who grew up well off in the suburbs," says Jeff Lox, a former colleague of Mr. Arnade.\par \par \uc2 Financial analysis came easy to him, Mr. Arnade says, and he enjoyed the problem-solving aspects of his job trading emerging-market bonds, a then-nascent industry. He traveled to countries such as Brazil and Argentina and enjoyed perks like getting a table at sushi restaurant Nobu without reservations.\par \par \uc2 "When you talk about grey matter, Chris clearly had that," says Stephen Dizard, Mr. Arnade's boss during his early years trading emerging-market bonds.\par \par \uc2 As he climbed the ranks, Mr. Arnade frequently argued politics with other traders, most of who leaned toward the "libertarian wing of the Republican party," says Peter Besold, a former co-worker who now trades for hedge fund \uc2 Millennium Management\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He moved in 2006 to \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 .'s proprietary trading desk, where he wagered as much as $100 million on single trades in government bonds and currencies. The move boosted his stress. "I used to wake up some mornings and have to vomit," he says.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arnade lost money in the 2008 financial crisis\u8212\'20\'14his only down year in two decades\u8212\'20\'14but that wasn't what turned him off trading.\par \par \uc2 "The thing that got to him was hearing [traders] who had lost millions and gotten bailed out complaining that Obamacare raised their taxes," Mr. Lox says.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Arnade grew angry at co-workers, he also wondered what they might accomplish if they quit finance to tackle economic and political issues. "One thing about banking, the people are smart and good at solving problems," he says. "It's such a waste."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arnade says he stayed on Wall Street so long because he and his family grew accustomed to their affluent lifestyle in Brooklyn, including private schools and luxury vacations. "I stuck it out as much by inertia as anything else," he says. To escape, he took half-day walks through New York photographing immigrant and poor communities.\par \par \uc2 A turning point came in 2012 when \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  shut down Mr. Arnade's proprietary trading desk because of new bank regulation. Around the same time, his mother died of pancreatic cancer.\par \par \uc2 "Let's just say I don't think my mom ever approved of my career," he says.\par \par \uc2 He decided to quit finance and focus on photo essays, starting with addicts and prostitutes he had befriended on walks in the Bronx.\par \par \uc2 The move caused anxiety at home. "I'm not the clingy type but there's a panic about \u8216\'20\'18where's the money going to come from?'" said Valerie Arnade, Mr. Arnade's wife. The family cut expenses by relocating to a house in New Paltz, a college town in the Hudson Valley.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arnade declined to disclose specifically how much money he made on Wall Street but says he saved enough to put his three children through college and maintain his family's new lifestyle.\par \par \uc2 He spent several years working on the streets, in squats and in rehabs getting to know his subjects for the series, which has been viewed about 1.5 million times on Flickr. Mrs. Arnade became his editor, catching mistakes and offering feedback on his writing, a partnership that continues today.\par \par \uc2 Some attacked his work on social media, calling it exploitative, and Mr. Arnade grew nostalgic for the arguments he used to have on Wall Street. "Everybody I ever dealt with on the trading floor would acknowledge when they were wrong," he says. "That doesn't happen on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 He began reporting for newspapers and magazines and in late 2014 started traveling to towns across the country with high rates of poverty and drug addiction. He met residents on the street, in churches and mosques, community colleges and \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  franchises. Many felt abandoned economically and angry enough about Wall Street bailouts to support Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 He began to question the quantitative approach to problems he developed as a physicist and trader. "I've come to understand the value of thinking emotionally," Mr. Arnade says. "Thinking about things rationally through numbers is very confining."\par \par \uc2 Driving through Bakersfield's dilapidated downtown, Mr. Arnade pulls over to speak to Ruth Tate, an 87-year-old African-American woman sweeping her sidewalk in the heat. She tells him about her move from Mississippi 50 years ago, her late husband's passing, her disappointment in how the U.S. is "going down the drain."\par \par \uc2 He listens, then asks, "I don't mean to make you uncomfortable but, is the racism bad here? Who did you vote for in the election?" She avoids the first question, then reluctantly says she voted for Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Kashkari: \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  Needs to Hold People Accountable\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, pointing to press reports about a shake-up at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 's (WFC) board of directors, says the San Francisco-based bank needs to hold people in the bank accountable for its scandals. "What we all saw happening at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  is totally unacceptable," Kashkari says, in response to a question at a town hall event about the scandals involving the bank's sales practices. "We need to hold people accountable for their actions," he says.

Forty-three percent of the companies polled in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://haystax.com/defending-wrong-enemy/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 new survey}}}\uc2  from the \uc2 SANS Institute\uc2 , a security training organization, and the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company \uc2 Haystax Technology\uc2  said malicious employees were their most worrisome security concern, though fewer than 20% of respondents said they had an insider threat-detection plan in place.\par \par \uc2 A new paper published by Columbia Law School's Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity now aims to help decision-makers mitigate cyber risk by effectively using background checks with a focus on cybersecurity. Researchers Robin Kempf, an associate professor at the John Jay college of Criminal Justice, and Chelsea Binns, an assistant professor of criminal justice and homeland security at St. John's University, examined financial industry hiring practices to determine what government and other private companies can learn.\par \par \uc2 When formulating a plan to conduct background checks on employees, the researchers recommended organizations should recognize which positions require access to sensitive data and proactively identify the types of criminal conduct--such as fraud or abusing technology privileges--that would prevent an employee from being hired.\par \par \uc2 The researchers advised organizations include in the hiring process an existing employee who does not have hiring responsibilities but is charged with supervising the data collection process and passing disqualifying information to hiring managers.\par \par \uc2 "I think any employer would tell you they would prefer not to conduct a background check because it's a process they don't want to endure," said Ms. Binns. "It can happen that a desirable candidate becomes unhireable because of a tentative lie on their resume or other misjudgment in their past. When employers are armed with that information they are obligated to act on that information because, if they don't, they're taking a huge risk for themselves and for their organization."\par \par \uc2 That risk was on display earlier this year when 11 former \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . employees filed a lawsuit against the bank after they were fired over background checks. \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  carried out the checks following a 2008 federal law that prohibited financial companies from employing workers with convictions for crime involving lies and other forms of dishonesty. In some cases the fired \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  employees' cases were decades old, for minor crimes, or had been expunged from their records.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  denies the claims in this lawsuit and stands by our hiring and employment policies and practices related to criminal background checks, but can't speak to the specifics of the individual allegations due to the litigation," stated the bank {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/02/07/wells-fargo-bank-lawsuit-fired-employees-wfc.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in a statement}}}\uc2  in February.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  slideshow {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonleopold/how-to-spot-a-leaker-according-to-the-fbi?utm_term=.txVO07jbB#.vhPx53Mz4"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 obtained by BuzzFeed News}}}\uc2  in May shows the \uc2 FBI\uc2  is working to detect potential risks, too. Even investigators at the bureau are likely having trouble ferreting out "high-risk behavior," though, based on criteria that counts working odd hours, traveling overseas without a good reason or personal bragging as potential red flags.\par \par \uc2 Researchers advised companies today to use their best judgment in their hiring practices today.\par \par \uc2 "Studies have shown that criminal history is one of the strongest indicators of future bad acts," said Ms. Kempf, adding the likelihood of an individual repeating bad acts drops significantly over time. "My advice would be to get as much information as you can."\par \par \uc2 (Jeff Stone writes exclusively for WSJ Pro Cybersecurity.

That's starting to change.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Maria LaMagna \par \uc2 1,668 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2017\par 03:01\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  has set its sights on millennials.\par \par \uc2 Martina Hund-Mejean\uc2 , Mastercard Inc.'s chief financial officer, says the company is positioning itself to take advantage of a shift toward greater use of credit cards by millennials as they become more confident about managing credit and debt.\par \par \uc2 The number of credit cards held by millennials in the U.S. amounted to an average of just over two per person in 2016, up 52% from 2010, according to \uc2 Experian PLC\uc2 , with an average balance per person of $3,542, up 32% from 2010. Grabbing as big a slice as possible of that growing market would help \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  compete with \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 . in the overall credit-card market, where \uc2 Visa\uc2  captured 53% of purchases in the U.S. in the first half of this year, compared with 22% for \uc2 Mastercard\uc2 , according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Ms. Hund-Mejean discussed \uc2 Mastercard\uc2 's efforts to attract the next generation of credit-card users around the world. Edited excerpts follow.\par \par \uc2 From insight to product\par \par \uc2 WSJ: What are some of the consumer insights you've learned recently about millennial behavior?\par \par \uc2 MS. HUND-MEJEAN: During and after the financial crisis, millennials were seeing how tough it actually was for their parents to be paying back the credit they got extended by providers and by banks. A lot of the millennials started using only debit-card kind of products because they thought they knew they could be doing their household budgeting in a better way without falling into the trap their parents fell into.\par \par \uc2 Well, lo and behold, as the millennials are maturing over the last two, three, four years, we're starting to see a changed behavior. They're starting to feel much more comfortable in terms of their own budgeting discipline. They learned it through what they're doing with their checking account and their debit account.\par \par \uc2 Everybody thought millennials are interested only in debit. They're actually growing into the credit-card space.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: How is \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  using that information in its business?\par \par \uc2 MS. HUND-MEJEAN: We know from research that millennials want to have more discipline when it comes to money management and want more control over spending. They also love to travel, see the world and have a memorable experience; they would probably enjoy travel-related rewards. They are concerned about digital security, and a good user experience is what they are looking for.\par \par \uc2 So, based on these insights, we enhanced our World Elite credit-card platform in the U.S. Instead of a ready-made, one-size-fits-all rewards program, our benefits optimizer provides cardholders a single online touchpoint for rewards management. People can track and manage multiple \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  accounts. From there they have the flexibility to access and activate their benefits, even selecting new ones. Pay With Rewards, a mobile app where consumers can set up when and where to redeem points automatically at the time of transaction, was developed from research that showed us that millennials want instant digital-redemption options.\par \par \uc2 Ease and safety\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Are millennials particularly interested in mobile and seamless ways to pay?\par \par \uc2 MS. HUND-MEJEAN: Digital and physical are moving together, it's completely converging. When you think about consumers, what they really like to do, they don't care if they're in a store or on a website, they want to pay the same way. Millennials and even centennials [those born after millennials] are no different in this respect. Where they're different from my generation is that they have been born into this technology-driven world. They have a mobile way of life.\par \par \uc2 So, in a mobile-first life, they expect to engage, interact and transact with friends, family, brands and even their money digitally. And they want to do so in simple and safe ways. That's where technologies like biometrics are coming into play. Some of our internal research has found that nearly 60% of millennials in the U.S. would like to be able to make payments by scanning their smartphone.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Mobile payments have grown significantly, but usage is still relatively small. \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  has invested in various ways of making payments, including wearables that can be used for payments and an app that works with smart refrigerators to pay for the items they order. Why do that now?\par \par \uc2 MS. HUND-MEJEAN: You need to think of this as a marathon, not a sprint. Plastic cards have been around for 50 years. People know how to use them, and merchants know how to accept them. So, that acceptance grows faster and easier.\par \par \uc2 For mobile payments, we're building on what we've learned. But think of it almost as the chicken and the egg. Merchants begin to accept mobile payments when there's enough pull from consumers for that. Consumers also tend to pick up mobile payments when there's enough acceptance for them. And then eventually the whole thing is picking up steam.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: As millennials have grown up, they've also seen many examples of data breaches and incidents of fraud online. It wasn't that long ago that companies including \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  began to require a switch from traditional credit cards that have a magnetic stripe to Europay-Mastercard-Visa, or EMV cards, which have added security features including a chip. Despite those upgrades, we still see cases of fraud. How is \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  moving forward to secure transactions?\par \par \uc2 MS. HUND-MEJEAN: In terms of EMV, which is only a small subchapter of fraud, everywhere EMV is rolled out, fraud has declined in a very significant way, even in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Where the fraud has increased for the U.S. is online. And that is because EMV is only in the physical space.\par \par \uc2 But chip-card technology is serving as a base for securing the online world as well, [by enabling the creation of] a unique code for every purchase. If that code appears more than once, the transaction would be red-flagged as fraudulent.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: To keep online payments secure, you've also invested in tokenization, which allows consumers to make payments without vendors having the ability to store cardholders' account information. Instead, the vendors receive a unique series of numbers\u8212\'20\'14a "token"\u8212\'20\'14that is used to validate the customer's identity. Is tokenization enough when it comes to preventing online fraud?\par \par \uc2 MS. HUND-MEJEAN: Tokens are creating a safer way to send data electronically, and our work in biometrics\u8212\'20\'14what some people refer to as selfie pay\u8212\'20\'14is helping to drive greater verification of the cardholder's identity.\par \par \uc2 If you were to think about fraud traditionally, think of a balloon. You could squeeze or reduce the air in one part, and it would flow to another part. That's what you've seen as new technologies are introduced in-store or online. What we're working on now is to not just move that air, or fraud, around, but to reduce and eliminate it through a multilayered strategy. And our security development over the years and recent acquisitions speak to that.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: What are some of those acquisitions? What else are you doing to reduce fraud?\par \par \uc2 MS. HUND-MEJEAN: We're heavily investing to make sure we get to the next areas of where we can keep you safe. Some of the areas are biometrics. Now you're using your thumbprint. \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  did selfie pay, which is facial recognition, which gets a lot more points in terms of recognizing you than a thumbprint. That might be the safer thing.\par \par \uc2 Currently, people identify themselves online with passwords and security questions, but these are neither secure, because they're easily stolen or socially engineered, nor easy to use, because they are often forgotten, there are too many of them. Mastercard Identity Check Mobile eliminates the need for cardholders to recall passwords, dramatically speeding up the digital checkout experience while also improving security. Instead, the cardholder can verify their identity by using the fingerprint scanner on their smartphone or via facial-recognition technology by taking a selfie photo.\par \par \uc2 Just recently [in March], one of my favorites, we bought a company called NuData. They recognize you depending on how you hold your iPhone and what you actually do in terms of typing in your password, at which speed you're typing in your password, and what else you're doing on the phone. So there's a lot of data and a lot of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  behind it that NuData uses.\par \par \uc2 No end for cash\par \par \uc2 WSJ: \uc2 Visa\uc2  recently offered $10,000 each to as many as 50 restaurants and food vendors who were willing to stop accepting cash. What do you think about efforts to go cashless?\par \par \uc2 MS. HUND-MEJEAN: I believe for decades we'll still be having cash. We probably will always have cash.\par \par \uc2 Even though one of our vision statements is "a world beyond cash," there will always be cash in countries for certain things. People will feel more comfortable with cash. I come from Germany. You will not get rid of cash in Germany. The grandmother will want to give a bill to her 10-year-old grandson and not have the parents know about it.\par \par \uc2 Ms. LaMagna is a reporter for MarketWatch in New York.

Early this year, Didi invested in 99, a ride-sharing company in Brazil.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-chinese-rival-didi-kuaidi-quietly-backs-its-u-s-rival-lyft-1441864107"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 It's also put money into}}}\uc2 Lyft Inc\uc2 . in the U.S. and Ola in India. Didi has reached beyond car services, investing in Ofo Inc., one of China's top bike-sharing apps, and in Ele.me, a major app-based food delivery service.\par \par \uc2 To some venture capitalists, Didi seems to be doing what they usually do\u8212\'20\'14raising money from investors and betting on startups they see as having growth potential. To others, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/graphics/chinas-tech-war-all-against-all/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Didi is following the playbook of internet giants}}}\uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 . and \uc2 Tencent Holdings Ltd\uc2 , both of which have invested in a wide range of domestic and foreign startups, including Didi.\par \par \uc2 In either case, analysts and members of the investment community say Didi isn't behaving like a startup\u8212\'20\'14even if it is the second most-valuable startup in the world with a $50 billion valuation\u8212\'20\'14just behind Uber.\par \par \uc2 "It's not normal for an unprofitable company to do this," says Wang Cong, a finance professor at China Europe International Business School. "Unprofitable startups should use the capital they raise on operations."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-ubers-fight-with-its-chinese-nemesis-didi-kuaidi-1441234010"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 In the year since it vanquished Uber after a depleting, subsidy-fueled battle for the China market}}}\uc2 , Didi is still unprofitable and has become more of an investor in other startups than a cutting-edge disrupter.\par \par \uc2 It now represents a new kind of startup, a fast-growing phenom that rises to the status of an industry giant due to its scale and capital. Abetting this is a winner-takes-all trend in the internet industry. Investors pile their cash on a small field of mega-startups, hoping to choose the one company that will dominate a particular sector (think \uc2 Facebook\uc2  for social media or Alibaba for e-commerce).\par \par \uc2 In its five years of existence, Didi has raised more than $15 billion in venture funding, private equity and debt financing, including $5.5 billion in April\u8212\'20\'14the largest round for any tech startup ever. That's more than the $12 billion Uber raised in total in seven years.\par \par \uc2 "Didi is a fundraising machine," a venture capitalist who isn't a Didi investor told me. "Its biggest competitive advantage is the huge amount of capital it raised, not its technology."\par \par \uc2 Bulked up with cash and seemingly dominant in its home market, Didi needs to justify its $50 billion valuation more than ever\u8212\'20\'14even its defenders say so. Uber's recent corporate turmoil and the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-posts-2-2-billion-loss-in-first-quarterly-report-stock-plunges-1494446940"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 share-price fall}}}\uc2  for Snapchat parent \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 . since its market debut show that the fortunes of widely admired startups can change quickly.\par \par \uc2 In announcing deals, Didi says its investments are strategic and that the company benefits from its relationships with regional winners across the world by sharing technology, product development and operations. The company says it offers 20 millions rides a day in China. "We are glad our investors support us in this strategy and see these choices bear good outcomes," a spokeswoman says.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Didi's victory over Uber last August}}}\uc2  left the Chinese company in a near monopoly position in its home market. Didi acquired Uber's China operations, while Uber became Didi's largest investor with a stake of about 18%.\par \par \uc2 Still, it proved to be too early for victory laps. Some of China's largest cities {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/didi-chinas-uber-navigates-rough-regulatory-road-1476105950"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 enacted stringent regulations on ride-sharing}}}\uc2 , decreasing the numbers of eligible drivers\u8212\'20\'14and hence the number of rides. With Uber out, Didi cut back on subsidies and raised prices for some services, sparking user complaints and criticism from state media. The popularity of bike sharing has also cut into Didi's business, according to mobile data monitoring site Trustdata.\par \par \uc2 While there's no sizable competitor for Didi, there are more than 130 ride-hailing platforms in the country, according to the transportation ministry. Some taxi companies\u8212\'20\'14Didi's biggest regulatory headache\u8212\'20\'14are beefing up their own ride-hailing services and have lodged a complaint about the Didi-Uber China merger with the regulator.\par \par \uc2 A Commerce Ministry spokesman recently said its antimonopoly department summoned Didi for meetings and is investigating the merger. Didi said it's in communication with authorities.\par \par \uc2 Looking to the future, Didi is also investing in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technologies, especially driverless cars\u8212\'20\'14a field that's nearly as crowded as ride-sharing. Even so, investors are still likely to lavish funds on the company because its position as China's biggest taxi service and its sizable war chest make Didi a safer bet.\par \par \uc2 "The logic of China's venture investing market is that it's not a problem if money can solve it, from talent, technology to market share," an investor in Didi told me. "It's getting really boring."\par \par \uc2 Write to Li Yuan at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:li.yuan@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 li.yuan@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Hitching a Ride\par \par \uc2 A look at ride-sharing company \uc2 Didi Chuxing\uc2 's investments\par \par \uc2 * Aug. 2017: Careem, ride-hailing in the Middle East and North Africa, value of investment unknown\par \par \uc2 * Aug. 2017: Taxify, ride-hailing in Europe and Africa, unknown investment value\par \par \uc2 * July 2017: Grab, ride-hailing in Southeast Asia, $2 billion with \uc2 SoftBank Group\par \par \uc2 * July 2017: Ofo, bike-sharing in China, unknown investment value\par \par \uc2 * Feb. 2017: Ofo, bike-sharing in China, unknown investment value\par \par \uc2 * Jan. 2017: 99, ride-sharing in Brazil, unknown investment value\par \par \uc2 * Sept. 2016: Ofo, bike-sharing in China, tens of millions of dollars\par \par \uc2 * Sept. 2016: Grab, ride-hailing in Southeast Asia, unknown investment value\par \par \uc2 * Nov. 2015: Ele'me, meal-delivery service in China, unknown investment value\par \par \uc2 * Sept. 2015: Ola, ride-hailing in India, unknown investment value\par \par \uc2 * Sept. 2015: Lyft, ride-hailing in the U.S., $100 million\par \par \uc2 * Aug. 2015: Grab, ride-hailing in Southeast Asia, unknown investment value Source: \uc2 Didi Chuxing\uc2 , Dealogic\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170810ed8a0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

It is adopting an \uc2 IBM\uc2  technology that can extract information from non-standardised papers and feed it straight into bank processing systems.\par \par \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and \uc2 Standard Chartered\uc2  are also both testing distributed ledger technology, in effect creating a secure electronic chain of information between buyer, seller, logistics and other service providers to slash paper use and speed up settlement. Digitising documents \u8212\'20\'14 which at present pass through \uc2 HSBC\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s industrial scanner, capable of scanning 10,000 an hour \u8212\'20\'14 eliminates the mountain of paper that guarantees payment between buyers and sellers.\par \par \uc2 But consultants caution that trade finance lacks more than technology: that the Victorian system has endured so long is testament to the lack of alternatives and absence of standardisation. Unlike in, say, ecommerce, there is no ecosystem of banks, shippers, ports and customs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBanks and others have been working on this for decades,\u8221\'20\'1D said Thomas Olsen, a partner at consultancy \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2  in Singapore. \u8220\'20\'1CThat has struggled over the last 20 years for a few reasons\u8221\'20\'1D including the difficulty in getting all constituents to move together.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 IBM\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology, initially in English language import and export bills \u8212\'20\'14 about a third of the total paper volume \u8212\'20\'14 will enable \uc2 HSBC\uc2  to jettison much of the mundane clerical work and increase accuracy, said Mr Moore.\par \par \uc2 Other companies are offering similar services, such as Singapore-based Taiger. \u8220\'20\'1CIf you have a human reading a document and extracting information, we can eliminate the human in 80-90 per cent of cases,\u8221\'20\'1D said Sinuhe Arroyo, Taiger\u8217\'20\'19s founder and chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170809ed890083z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Houseparty has more than a million daily users. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to them as monthly users. (Aug. 11)\par \par \uc2 Tech startups live by the rule that speed is paramount. Houseparty, creator of a hot video app, has an extra reason for urgency.\par \par \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 ., a dominant force in Silicon Valley, is stalking the company, part of the social network's aggressive {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-rivals-shadow-looms-over-snapchat-ipo-1486296005"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mimicking of smaller rivals}}}\uc2 . \uc2 Facebook\uc2  is being aided by an internal "early bird" warning system that identifies potential threats, according to people familiar with the technology.\par \par \uc2 This fall, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  plans to launch an app similar to Houseparty, internally called Bonfire, say people familiar with the project. Both apps let groups of people hang out over live video on a smartphone.\par \par \uc2 "They see we're having traction," says Sima Sistani, co-founder of Houseparty, which is based in San Francisco. "That's why we're pushing so hard."\par \par \uc2 Silicon Valley is dominated by a few titans, a development that's fundamentally altering the nature of America's startup culture. While it's as easy as ever to start a company, it is getting harder to grow fast enough and big enough to avoid getting either acquired or squashed by one of the behemoths.\par \par \uc2 For months, Houseparty could see \uc2 Facebook\uc2  in the rearview mirror. Last year, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  executives approached it for meetings the startup interpreted as exploring an acquisition. Then, two months after Houseparty publicly introduced itself as "the internet's living room" in November, \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's Messenger app said it would become a "virtual living room."\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  in February launched a study of Houseparty, wooing its teenage users in a post that began: "Hi everyone!! Do you use Houseparty?"\par \par \uc2 The deep pockets of giants such as \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . make it increasingly difficult for startups to compete and stay independent. The four firms have a combined market capitalization of almost $2.5 trillion, a rough equivalent to the annual gross domestic product of France.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  acquired photo-sharing app \uc2 Instagram\uc2  in 2012 for $1 billion and messaging service WhatsApp in 2014 for $22 billion. \uc2 Google\uc2  in 2013 bought Waze, a rival to Google Maps. \uc2 Amazon\uc2  in 2010 bought Quidsi, the online retailing company behind diapers.com and other sites, after trying to copy it.\par \par \uc2 Lately, the titans also appear to be imitating smaller rivals more aggressively. In July, a week after the initial public offering of \uc2 Blue Apron Holdings Inc\uc2 ., an \uc2 Amazon\uc2  subsidiary {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/07/17/it-might-be-time-to-add-blue-apron-to-the-death-by-amazon-index/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 filed to trademark a meal-delivery kit}}}\uc2  with a tagline that echoed Blue Apron's offering. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-is-developing-technology-for-snapchat-like-media-content-1501868688"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Both Google and Facebook have taken aim at }}}\uc2 features on Snap. Inc.'s Snapchat platform. \uc2 Amazon\uc2  declined to comment. \uc2 Google\uc2  didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 At an all-hands meeting last summer, Facebook Chief Executive \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  told employees they shouldn't let pride get in the way of serving users, another way of saying they shouldn't be afraid to copy rivals, according to someone who was at the meeting. The message became an informal internal slogan: "Don't be too proud to copy."\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  executives have said publicly it is common in tech for companies to build on technologies pioneered by others.\par \par \uc2 Regulators, politicians and academics are increasingly questioning how tech giants use their considerable clout. In June, the \uc2 European Union\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/google-slapped-with-2-7-billion-eu-fine-over-search-results-1498556971"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 antitrust regulators fined Google}}}\uc2  $2.71 billion, saying its search engine favored its own comparison-shopping service over others. \uc2 Google\uc2  has said it disagrees with the conclusions and will consider an appeal.\par \par \uc2 "If you're an app, are you better off getting acquired or competing against one of the big platforms?" says Scott Stern, management professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While getting acquired can be "a very good win for the founders, that might be at the expense of a more competitive landscape."\par \par \uc2 Houseparty, formally known as Life on Air Inc., was one of the first startups to go all-in on video chat, with an app that lets small groups of friends drop into a video conversation as if hanging out in a dorm room. It has tapped a coveted audience: teens who love Snapchat but not necessarily \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The odds are already stacked against it. The average smartphone user has about 89 apps on a device but uses only seven or eight daily, according to Verto \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Apple and \uc2 Google\uc2  dominate, commanding about 60% of the time and 80% of the ad dollars spent on mobile, the market-research firm says.\par \par \uc2 Houseparty "is one of the cool new apps\u8212\'20\'14a good example of somebody who is challenging the status quo and may have success in a certain age group," says Verto CEO Hannu Verkasalo. But \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2  and Apple "are extremely monopolistic," he says. "It's very difficult to break in."\par \par \uc2 Two of Houseparty's founders\u8212\'20\'14Ms. Sistani, 38, and Ben Rubin, 29\u8212\'20\'14have been on the verge of success before. They previously led one of the first live-video-streaming apps, Meerkat, but its downloads tumbled after \uc2 Twitter Inc\uc2 . booted the app off its platform in favor of its own live-streaming app.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  delivered the death blow to Meerkat by deciding to go full force into live video. "We couldn't go head to head," recalls one of Meerkat's investors, \uc2 Josh Elman\uc2 , a former Facebook manager who is a partner at the venture-capital firm \uc2 Greylock Partners\uc2  and a Houseparty investor and board member.\par \par \uc2 Later that summer, Mr. Rubin, Ms. Sistani and several others including the third co-founder, Itai Danino, sequestered themselves for several days to brainstorm. What users loved about Meerkat, they decided, was a feature that let them share the screen for 60 seconds with a friend. That type of video interaction was more private than the live video broadcasts on Meerkat, they concluded, and more spontaneous than a phone call.\par \par \uc2 Their new app idea: "We want to remind people how nice it is to catch up with your friends. Or how easy it is to say hi to your mom," says Mr. Rubin. "It doesn't need to be this heavy thing."\par \par \uc2 In February 2016, Mr. Rubin and Ms. Sistani launched Houseparty and began to demo it on college campuses. In May 2016, it briefly became the top social-networking app for the iPhone, according to app-research firm Sensor Tower.\par \par \uc2 Houseparty downloads went from 10,000 to 100,000 in one day and then crashed, unable to handle the load. The app was down for several hours and then glitchy through July, when the team decided it needed a major overhaul.\par \par \uc2 When Houseparty was at its most vulnerable, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  came knocking. Fidji Simo, head of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's video efforts, contacted Mr. Rubin, according to people familiar with the contact. She wanted to talk about live video, the people say. It was the first sign \uc2 Facebook\uc2  was scrutinizing Houseparty.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zuckerberg is sensitive to anything that might disrupt \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , even the teeniest startup, say current and former executives and employees.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  uses an internal database to track rivals, including young startups performing unusually well, people familiar with the system say. The database stems from \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's 2013 acquisition of a Tel Aviv-based startup, Onavo, which had built an app that secures users' privacy by routing their traffic through private servers. The app gives \uc2 Facebook\uc2  an unusually detailed look at what users collectively do on their phones, these people say.\par \par \uc2 The tool shaped \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's decision to buy WhatsApp and informed its live-video strategy, they say. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  used Onavo to build its early-bird tool that tips it off to promising services and that helped \uc2 Facebook\uc2  home in on Houseparty.\par \par \uc2 Houseparty says its growth had been stymied by the app's crash, which slowed its ability to introduce new features and attract new users. The calls from \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's Ms. Simo led to "natural conversations," says Mr. Elman, the Houseparty investor and director, in which \uc2 Facebook\uc2  was exploring whether Houseparty would be a good fit for an acquisition.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rubin didn't want to sell but was under pressure from his board to keep Houseparty's options open, Mr. Elman says. "If a company like \uc2 Facebook\uc2  or Snapchat needs your team's expertise, that might be a better return for shareholders than the risk of going big," Mr. Elman says he told Mr. Rubin.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rubin says in general he isn't against getting acquired as long as the opportunity would allow him "to continue to work on the mission on a larger scale."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rubin communicated with Ms. Simo and others over email and phone and then met with \uc2 Facebook\uc2  executives at \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's offices, says a person familiar with the contacts. Messrs. Rubin and Elman declined to discuss details of the conversations.\par \par \uc2 Later, Ms. Simo informed Houseparty the talks wouldn't go further, the person says. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  said Ms. Simo declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 In December, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  began its group-video-chat offensive. Its Messenger app introduced the feature with the ability to see up to six people in a conversation, compared with the eight-person rooms on Houseparty.\par \par \uc2 In February, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  invited Houseparty users between the ages of 13 and 17 to come to its offices in Menlo Park, Calif., to participate in a study and keep a diary for a week afterward that they would share with \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , offering as an inducement $275 \uc2 Amazon\uc2  gift cards.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Houseparty readied for battle with $50 million in fresh funding in December from a group led by \uc2 Sequoia Capital\uc2 , a venture-capital firm that invested in WhatsApp and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 . Mike Vernal, a former \uc2 Facebook\uc2  executive, a Sequoia partner and Houseparty director, says \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's interest in Houseparty and live video chat is to be expected because "\uc2 Facebook\uc2  has a mission that is fundamentally about helping people connect with each other." He says he is optimistic about Houseparty's growth potential.\par \par \uc2 Houseparty rebuilt its app so it could expand reliably without crashing. It added 25 employees, increasing its staff by 30%. Last month, it recruited a vice president of engineering, Kinshuk Mishra, who had helped \uc2 Spotify AB\uc2 , the music-streaming service, fend off Apple Music. It introduced a new chat feature called "passing notes" to attract more users.\par \par \uc2 In Houseparty's office in an unmarked warehouse in San Francisco's trendy Soma neighborhood, the startup's leaders huddled in a tense meeting in May to discuss plans to beef up the app. When Ms. Sistani heard the company's lawyer had delayed some minor changes to the terms of service, the latest in a series of delays, she jumped in and said: "No. No. No. No! Just update the policy."\par \par \uc2 The pressure increased later that month when Houseparty learned of Bonfire, \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's planned live group-chat app. (Tech news site The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15916850/facebook-houseparty-clone-bonfire-group-video-chat"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Verge reported on Bonfire in July}}}\uc2 .) "I have no problem with the copying," Mr. Rubin says. "It's just business. It's just a distraction."\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0B\u8203\'20\'0BHouseparty, which has one-million-plus daily users, compared with \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's 1.32 billion, is determined to beat Bonfire, he says.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Elman says he is encouraged that Bonfire is a stand-alone app and that \uc2 Facebook\uc2  hasn't been particularly successful with those. But, he says, if \uc2 Facebook\uc2  figures out how to integrate the power of Houseparty "into a property that I'm already using 10 times a day, that would scare the crap out of me."\par \par \uc2 Write to Betsy Morris at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:betsy.morris@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 betsy.morris@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Deepa Seetharaman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170809ed8900335\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

"I will give you an exact date in a week."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rubin's company is attempting to challenge Apple and \uc2 Samsung\uc2  with a new phone at roughly the same time as the smartphone behemoths unroll major releases. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-anniversary-edition-gives-analysts-pre-party-jitters-1498642205"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Apple in September is expected to unveil}}}\uc2  three new phones, instead of the usual two, including a special 10th-anniversary iPhone with a different display and new features like wireless charging and facial-recognition technology. \uc2 Samsung\uc2  next month is expected to launch its premium Galaxy Note 8 phone.\par \par \uc2 Essential has gained attention largely because of the pedigree of Mr. Rubin, who sold his previous startup, Android, to \uc2 Google\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14now a unit of \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14in 2005, and then helped turn its software into the world's most-used smartphone operating system, rivaling Apple's iPhone.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, Essential is trying to create the same brand affinity that Apple has created by building a complete hardware-software ecosystem. The Essential smartphone itself comes with a special port that the company hopes will attract the development of a wide range of accessories, to go with its own 360-degree camera. It also plans a device called Home that will control household smart devices. Mr. De Masi also declined to provide release-date details for that device.\par \par \uc2 "In the Western world there is a need for there to be a new lovemark," Mr. De Masi said, "a brand where there is an emotive connection for consumers."\par \par \uc2 Essential isn't targeting mass-market popularity out of the gate. The initial strategy is to take advantage of the company's small scale to innovate faster than larger rivals, said Mr. De Masi, pointing to his phone's titanium-ceramic shell, which he said wouldn't be possible to manufacture in iPhone-size quantities.\par \par \uc2 "If we are able to sell low single digit millions [in the first year] that's very successful for a startup," Mr. De Masi said.\par \par \uc2 Distribution will be limited at the start. \uc2 Sprint Corp\uc2 ., the fourth-largest carrier in the U.S., is the only wireless company that will stock it in the U.S. Telus Corp. will carry it in Canada. The phone will also be available unlocked, for use on any carrier network, at \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2 , \uc2 Best Buy\uc2  and Essential.com.\par \par \uc2 Mr. De Masi declined to provide details for those carriers' offers. He said international carrier relationships would be announced later this year.\par \par \uc2 Analysts are skeptical of Essential's chances.\par \par \uc2 "Having a good product isn't enough in a crowded market" said analyst Neil Mawston of research firm Strategy \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , emphasizing the importance in the U.S. of distribution via top carriers \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Verizon Communications Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 T-Mobile US\uc2 . Inc. "If you don't get buy in from the big three, you're stopped before you've even started."\par \par \uc2 Essential was set earlier this year to raise $100 million from \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 ., which owns \uc2 Sprint\uc2 , but the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-drops-100-million-investment-in-iphone-rival-1490023608"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Japanese investor scrapped the deal}}}\uc2  partly because of its close relationship with Apple, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Apple committed $1 billion to SoftBank's Vision Fund.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Essential turned to a number of new investors for the latest round, including Access Technology Ventures, which led the investment, Vy Capital and Australia's sovereign-wealth fund.\par \par \uc2 Mr. De Masi declined to disclose Essential's valuation. Equidate, a marketplace for private-company shares, estimated Essential's valuation at $1 billion based on its shares outstanding and share price. Essential has raised a total of $330 million.\par \par \uc2 Write to Rolfe Winkler at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:rolfe.winkler@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rolfe.winkler@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170809ed8900233\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Quantitative hedge funds and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  will disrupt hedge funds." So says Jeff Tarrant of Prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 Partners (" Fledgling quants seek to disrupt Wall Street ", August 2).\par \par \uc2 There is a glaring assumption in this statement. Mr Tarrant is assuming that books, music and television have similar business models to asset management. These businesses are different and should not be compared to one another.\par \par \uc2 First, books, music and television all focus on tangible value for money. Why would a consumer not purchase a product that is cheaper and easier when the desired result is known? As consumers our goal is to read a book, listen to music and watch television. We all understand these processes, and if a product arrives that facilitates these more cheaply and quickly, why would we not exploit this anomaly?\par \par \uc2 The fundamental premise for asset management is to generate excess returns for clients. This is far more intangible as it involves attempting to navigate the future. To compensate for future uncertainty, diversification is necessary. Every intelligent investor should seek to diversify his or her holdings. The future is unknowable and it has been proved that excess returns in all asset classes are often generated from unconventional and relatively unpopular investment techniques. If the popularity of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and quantitative hedge funds continues to grow, will there be any future promise of excess returns in a crowded environment? In asset management, concentration is a double-edged sword; while it works well during periods of prosperity, the opposite is true in times of misfortune. The same cannot be said for books, music and television.\par \par \uc2 The anomaly of instantly tangible, cheaper and easier products is not necessarily available in asset management. Even if it is available, the time that it takes for the results from buying a product to materialise enable consumers to question their judgments, which inhibits the domination of disruption.\par \par \uc2 Finally, consumers of books, music and television do not say: "I'll get a book from Waterstones and \uc2 Amazon\uc2  to hedge my bets for the forthcoming ambiguity of retail business models." While I invest in a few quantitative hedge funds and they have, for all intents and purposes, been disrupters, I do not believe they will disrupt the industry with the same majesty of Apple, \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and \uc2 Netflix\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ferdinand Campbell\par \par \uc2 RWC,\par \par \uc2 London SW1, UK\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170808ed880001e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The SoftBank Vision Fund is still being completed after gathering $93 billion in an initial closing in May. An earlier version of this story said $93 million. (Aug. 8, 2017) \par \par \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . and its Vision Fund are closing a $1 billion investment in online sports retail company \uc2 Fanatics Inc\uc2 ., part of a sizable bet the startup's licensing agreements with the \uc2 National Football League\uc2  and others give it the power to compete with e-commerce giant \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The investment in the e-commerce company is scheduled to close this month as part of a round of funding that will lift its total valuation to $4.5 billion {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323844804578529661628131042"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 from $3 billion}}}\uc2 , the people said. Other investors in this round include the \uc2 NFL\uc2  and Major League Baseball, which invested about $95 million and $50 million, respectively, earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank in April made an initial investment of an undisclosed sum, according to a person familiar with the matter, but the bulk of the $1 billion investment comes from SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund. The fund, whose investors include Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth funds as well as companies such as \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Qualcomm Inc\uc2 ., is still being completed after gathering $93 billion in an initial closing in May.\par \par \uc2 In addition to Fanatics, the Vision Fund has committed to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-invests-300-million-in-wework-1490051107"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 invest nearly $3 billion in shared-office-space giant WeWork}}}\uc2  Cos. and $1 billion in satellite-internet startup \uc2 OneWeb Ltd\uc2 ., among others.\par \par \uc2 The Fanatics deal reflects SoftBank and its Vision Fund's belief that the company has built an e-commerce business that can withstand the pressures of Amazon, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Still, selling sports jerseys and caps online appears to stray from the Vision Fund's stated mission: investing in startups at the forefront of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Investments fitting that mold include the acquisition of \uc2 Google\uc2 's robotics division \uc2 Boston Dynamics\uc2  and a stake in chip maker \uc2 Nvidia Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fanatics has signed long-term licensing agreements through at least 2030 with major U.S. sports leagues, giving it exclusive rights to sell and make licensed merchandise. It also has agreements to manage e-commerce sales and operations for international soccer clubs like \uc2 Manchester United\uc2  and Real Madrid.\par \par \uc2 The company's revenue last year topped $1.4 billion, up from about $1 billion in 2015. It expects to generate $2.2 billion in revenue this year. About three-quarters of revenue is direct-to-consumer sales from Fanatics.com or the 200-plus team and league sites the company operates.\par \par \uc2 Fanatics' revenue pales in comparison to Amazon, which had $94.66 billion in net product sales last year, and \uc2 eBay Inc\uc2 . which did nearly $80 billion in gross merchandise volume on its marketplace.\par \par \uc2 Analysts largely believe those large e-commerce players will continue to grow by acquiring smaller competitors or forcing rivals out of business. Only some niche players are expected to survive.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank has been burned by previous e-commerce investments. It invested $627 million in India's Snapdeal in 2014 only to see the online marketplace lose ground to Amazon. In May, SoftBank said it took a $1.4 billion loss on investments in its most recent fiscal year, largely from its stakes in Snapdeal and India taxi-hailing app Ola.\par \par \uc2 Fanatics has tried to differentiate itself from other e-commerce companies by adding manufacturing capabilities. In May, it acquired Majestic, a division of \uc2 VF Corp\uc2 ., giving it several manufacturing facilities. It is making Under Armour Inc.-branded MLB uniforms for retail and using the factories to accelerate its efforts to bring fast-fashion to sports.\par \par \uc2 For example, after \uc2 New York Yankees\uc2  slugger Aaron Judge won the home run derby in July, Fanatics began marketing and manufacturing T-shirts celebrating the victory. It was able to do so quickly, people familiar with the company said, because it is an official licensee of MLB and owned the manufacturing facilities to make the shirts.\par \par \uc2 Other Fanatics investors include Singapore state-owned investment company \uc2 Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd\uc2 ., \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 ., \uc2 Insight Venture Partners\uc2  and \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mayumi Negishi contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Tripp Mickle at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Liz Hoffman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:liz.hoffman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 liz.hoffman@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170808ed88004mp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Most folks realized these startups hooked millions of ordinary people with this seemingly innocuous form of sports gambling.\par \par \uc2 Some sports nerds with a penchant for number-crunching recognized another thing about fantasy sports: The art of stacking a fantasy baseball team with power sluggers has more than a few things in common with the venture capitalist seeking to sniff out the next big thing. Most important, it turns out that venture investors\u8212\'20\'14like today's generation of data-crazy baseball executives\u8212\'20\'14can position their team for some outsize returns (or wins) by harnessing the power of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Who knew?\par \par \uc2 Tauhid Zaman, a professor of behavioral \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at MIT Sloan School of Management, and his doctoral student assistant cleaned up cash prize pools when they put their predictive analytical chops to work in \uc2 DraftKings\uc2 ' contests. Along they way, Mr. Zaman noticed that venture investors, like fantasy sports participants, both try to win the big payout with a home-run kind of performance.\par \par \uc2 For VCs, of course, it's all about a fund shooting for an exit that will result in a massive payday that returns the whole fund. Same idea in the winner-take-all form of fantasy sports; the professor thought that the quantitative models that served him well with baseball and hockey picks could be applied to the venture industry's challenge of picking a winning portfolio. After creating elaborate scoring methods to study outcomes for 58,000 startups over the past 16 years, the MIT team racked up some big wins\u8212\'20\'14and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/data-driven-portfolios-power-home-run-exits-in-mit-study-1502105402"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 outperformed the exit rates for some of venture capital's most vaunted firms}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "In both cases," Mr. Zaman said, "we were trying to pick entries (lineups of players or startup companies) so that one of them does really, really well, or \u8216\'20\'18wins.' Remember, one winner makes you all the money."\par \par \uc2 Chalk up another win for the predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  model making its way into venture capital.\par \par \uc2 Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 When Melinda Roberts found shingles in her front yard after a storm, her insurer didn't dispatch a claims adjuster to investigate. It sent a drone.\par \par \uc2 The unmanned aircraft hovered above Ms. Roberts's three-bedroom Birmingham, Ala., home and snapped photos of her roof. About a week later, a check from \uc2 Liberty Mutual Insurance\uc2  arrived to cover repairs. "It took a lot less time than I was expecting," Ms. Roberts said.\par \par \uc2 Drones, photo-taking apps and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  are accelerating what has long been a clunky, time-consuming experience: the auto or home-insurance claim.\par \par \uc2 Traditionally, an insurance claim associated with minor home damage or fender-bender auto accidents started with a phone call from a customer and ended days or weeks later with a mailed check. In between, the insurer often would send an inspector to investigate the situation in person.\par \par \uc2 But about four in 10 car insurers no longer use employees to physically inspect damage in some cases, according to a \uc2 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\uc2  survey of insurance executives. Claims that rely on greater automation can be handled in two to three days, compared with 10 to 15 days for a more traditional approach that involves an in-person visit, according to the survey.\par \par \uc2 One new home insurer, Lemonade, drew attention in January, when it said it took just three seconds for its \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  claims bot to settle and pay a claim for a stolen jacket.\par \par \uc2 Insurers typically guard their claims-handling times as industry secrets. But some said the time for a customer to get a price estimate and receive a payment is speeding up, and the change could make it more likely that policies are renewed.\par \par \uc2 A faster process can also save insurers money. About 11 cents of every premium dollar in personal property-and-casualty insurance is spent on investigating and settling claims, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\par \par \uc2 Automation can reduce the size of payouts, too. "The faster you can settle a claim, typically the less you can settle it for, so there is a direct financial incentive," said Matthew Josefowicz, chief executive of insurance-technology consulting firm Novarica. Claims such as water damage can get worse if they aren't addressed quickly, he said.\par \par \uc2 Speed can have drawbacks. Some auto-repair-shop industry groups have argued that photo-based appraisals can overlook significant damage and actually slow the claims process.\par \par \uc2 "It's great to speed up certain parts of the process, [but] to think that one photograph, one piece of code or one algorithm is the Holy Grail, I think is a bit of a misnomer," said Andrew Newman, president of reinsurance broker Willis Re.\par \par \uc2 Delaware, Pennsylvania and Virginia changed their regulations last year to allow appraisers to base car-repair estimates on photos or videos, but Massachusetts and Rhode Island still have some restrictions on photo appraisals.\par \par \uc2 Chicago startup Snapsheet helps car insurers with photo appraisals, using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to speed up the process. It takes up to three hours for the company to produce a price estimate after a customer submits photos of a damaged car, according to CJ Przybyl, Snapsheet's president.\par \par \uc2 For claims involving more minor damage, the processing time is expected to fall sharply as automation continues. A car-insurance claim is currently handled by an average of three employees, said Bill Brower, vice president of claims at \uc2 RELX Group\uc2 's \uc2 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\uc2  -- the same number as when he started working in the industry in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 Soon, the entire claims process -- from notifying insurance companies when damage occurs to estimating repair costs based on photos -- could be done with no human input, he said. \uc2 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\uc2  helps insurers streamline their claims processes. "We're on the cusp of this major, major change" in claims handling, Mr. Brower said. "Consumers' expectations have changed."\par \par \uc2 At Lemonade, customers already file claims by chatting with a bot through the Lemonade app, uploading relevant photos and recording videos of themselves describing the loss. The company's algorithms run 18 antifraud tests, said \uc2 Daniel Schreiber\uc2 , Lemonade's CEO.\par \par \uc2 The New York company said about one-fourth of its claims are settled and paid automatically, with the rest being passed on to a team of humans to assess. Lemonade launched in September and now sells policies in four states.\par \par \uc2 Allstate Corp\uc2 . told car-repair shops in March that it is asking customers to send photos of car damage through its app rather than using drive-in inspection centers. The switch cut the time for a customer to get an estimate from several days to about 13 hours, an \uc2 Allstate\uc2  executive told repair shops in a May letter.\par \par \uc2 "We give customers their money in hours, not in days," Allstate Chief Executive \uc2 Tom Wilson\uc2  said in a May conference call. "It's cheaper, better and faster."\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Liberty Mutual\uc2 , adjusters are now using drones daily to photograph home damage, said Lily Wray, the company's vice president of claims innovation for U.S. consumer markets. It is one of several insurance companies that have received federal approval in recent years to use or test unmanned aircraft to inspect everything from hail-damaged roofs to collapsed buildings. "We're taking something that takes hours down to minutes," she said.\par \par \uc2 Insurers say drones will improve their ability to swiftly respond to claims from hurricanes, tornadoes and floods by providing aerial images of places claims adjusters can't always access. They also see drones as a way to reduce injuries from risky roof inspections.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Roberts, the \uc2 Liberty Mutual\uc2  customer with roof damage in Alabama, was relieved that the insurer's drone saved a claims adjuster a climb to the top of her house.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170808000010"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170808ed8800009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

I must have heard this phrase some time in the past - a greek, via FT.com\par \par \uc2 British pension schemes prepare to axe investment consultants\par \par \uc2 In 2013, our local government pension scheme's investment consultant stated that passive funds were unlikely to be beaten on performance. That same year, our consultant advised us to invest in a smart-beta fund to beat an index. It didn't, has higher costs, higher volatility and poorer performance.\par \par \uc2 What can we do about it? Nothing, as their advice is not regulated for occupational pension funds and, legally, they state that they only offer advice and what the subcommittee does with it is their own fault.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FCA\uc2  has continually let down contributors to occupational pension funds - Alpha man, via email\par \par \uc2 There will always be a need for advisers, given that trustees are lay people without specialist knowledge.

The company says its test uses a combination of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , genomics algorithms, and next-generation sequencing to detect more than 1,250 pathogens.\par \par \uc2 The test, which uses a standard blood draw, identifies DNA fragments left by bacteria, viruses, fungi and other pathogens in the blood. Karius is making the test commercially available as a lab service and says it can typically deliver a diagnosis within one business day of receiving a blood sample.\par \par \uc2 Karius, which has operated quietly since raising seed financing led by Data Collective in 2014, is commercial-ready now and has made its technology available to hospitals and research institutes, said Data Collective Managing Partner Matt Ocko.\par \par \uc2 Write to Brian Gormley at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:brian.gormley@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 brian.gormley@wsj.com}}}\uc2  Twitter: @BrianPGormley\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170807ed87000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

They set out to make a framework that can identify a portfolio that has either huge returns (in the form of profitable exits) or none at all, and to create a data-rich ways to measure them.\par \par \uc2 According to Mr. Zaman, their portfolio model outperformed the venture industry, returning exit rates of as much as 60% vs. about half that for top firms like Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund and Greylock Partners. Those returns came from exits by companies that had seed or Series A funding rounds in 2011 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 Seeking to maximize the probability of achieving at least one exit, they found had higher success rates based on quantitative scoring of investments combined with estimated "drift" of valuations that came with each funding round.\par \par \uc2 To build quantitative scoring of companies, the researchers attached numerical ratings on a wide range of attributes of startups, ranging from educational background of founders to the exit track records of their investors. Their study covered some 83,000 companies founded in 2000 or later, using public sources such as LinkedIn and \uc2 PitchBook Data\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zaman said that after trailing behind other areas of finance, the venture industry is finally able to embrace quantitative investing that allows investors to use \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and predictive modeling to mine rich depositories of data.\par \par \uc2 "This is the year, now," he said, "when you have that data to test out the models."\par \par \uc2 Write to Alexander Davis at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Alec.Davis@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Alec.Davis@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170807ed870005n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Value investing is mired in one of its worst stretches on record, prompting concerns that the investment style favored by generations of fund managers is losing its effectiveness.\par \par \uc2 Value stocks, those that are cheaper than many peers relative to earnings or reported net worth and are typically purchased by fund managers anticipating long-term appreciation, have significantly lagged behind their growth-stock counterparts so far this year, compounding a gap that has persisted since the end of the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Instead, investors have gravitated toward companies with fast earnings or price growth, such as \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Netflix Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Tesla Inc\uc2 ., and the market's price/earnings ratio has continued to rise -- a trend that many value investors contend can't continue forever.\par \par \uc2 Stocks that look cheap relative to traditional fundamental metrics such as profit or cash flow have fallen so far out of favor that \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  in June questioned whether the markets are witnessing the death of value investing. With value investments in Europe and Asia also struggling, value funds globally are on track to post their worst performance this year relative to growth funds since before the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 The struggle for value stocks over such a prolonged period contradicts the popular investment approach coined by financial analyst Benjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, and since popularized by \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2 . The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chairman has attracted a legion of followers who remain confident that value investing will never go out of style.\par \par \uc2 From the Great Depression to the U.S. tech bubble to the global financial crisis, the notion that a new paradigm would replace value investing has repeatedly occurred. Those predictions have almost always ended poorly.\par \par \uc2 While value investing appears to have lost some luster now as the so-called FAANG stocks -- \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 ., Amazon, \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  parent \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . -- have surged in value, the most steadfast devotees to value-style investing are often the ones that benefit most in market downturns.\par \par \uc2 The market's attraction to highflying stocks punished value investors in a similar fashion in the late 1990s during the dot-com bubble. Growth stocks beat their value peers toward the end of two major bull markets that peaked in 2000 and 2007, before large market selloffs reversed the trend, putting value stocks ahead.\par \par \uc2 Some investors today worry that the longer growth stocks are viewed as nearly invincible, the worse the likely pullback will ultimately be. "The super-stocks that lead a bull market inevitably become priced for perfection," said \uc2 Howard Marks\uc2 , the co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management who correctly estimated in January 2000 that tech and internet stocks were overheated and about to fall -- two months before the dot-com bubble burst. "And in many cases, the companies' perfection turns out eventually to be either illusory or ephemeral."\par \par \uc2 The attraction to growth stocks, investors and analysts say, stems from the low interest rates, slow economic growth and mild inflation that have gripped the world. Central banks have been accommodative for so long that they have skewed conventional investor wisdom, analysts say, benefiting companies that can generate growth.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S., the Russell 1000 Growth Index beat its value-stock counterpart by 10 percentage points in the first half, the widest spread over that period since 2009. Over the past decade, the performance of U.S. growth stocks has been almost three times better than that of value stocks, contributing to what index fund giant State Street Global Advisors calls "the longest period of underperformance for value since the late 1940s."\par \par \uc2 Investors have pulled $116 billion from U.S. large-cap value funds over the past 10 years, according to \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 , with more than one-fourth of that outflow occurring over the past 12 months.\par \par \uc2 In Europe, the MSCI Europe Value index, which includes stocks with low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings and price-to-book ratios, gained 3% in the first six months of the year. The MSCI Europe Growth index gained 9% over the same period. The trend also holds true in Asia, where an MSCI regional value index underperformed its growth counterpart by 10 percentage points in the first half.\par \par \uc2 "In this low-inflation, low-growth world we've become accustomed to, investors are chasing anything that has growth tied to it," says Kelman Li, an analyst at Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. "When that happens, value suffers."\par \par \uc2 Many of the largest stocks in Asia with low price/earnings ratios have been among the worst performers this year, he said. Yet since 1990, value stocks have actually outperformed growth. Mr. Li calls this phenomenon a "historical paradox" for investors in Asia and emerging markets, who typically search for growth.\par \par \uc2 For now, "every market in Asia screens as overvalued," Mr. Li said. "The bias toward growth continues."\par \par \uc2 Value fund managers have felt the pinch. The median value fund around the world trailed the median growth fund by 7 percentage points in 2017's first half, on pace for the worst underperformance since 2007, according to \uc2 eVestment\uc2 . The data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm measured actively managed value and growth funds in the U.S., Europe and Asia -- which collectively have $8.8 trillion in assets under management -- and found that so far this year value funds have lagged behind growth in all three regions for the first time since 2010.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, much of value's underperformance could still be cyclical. "Sometimes value investing strategies will probably cease to work as investors flock to exploit them, yet it certainly does not follow that value investing as a whole will ever be out for good," Nobel Prize-winning economist \uc2 Robert Shiller\uc2  wrote in his book "Irrational Exuberance."\par \par \uc2 But for some who have practiced value investing throughout their careers, value stocks' time in the wilderness is starting to seem awfully long. "This time seems very, very different," longtime value investor \uc2 Jeremy Grantham\uc2 , the co-founder and chief investment strategist at Boston money manager GMO, wrote in a recent quarterly letter. In a follow-up note, he added that valuations have stayed richer for far longer than historical cycles have previously dictated. "As a value manager, I wish it were not so."\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich485\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal7275

It is more that you will have to cede your intellectual superiority to one.\par \par \uc2 The bread and butter for Wall Street analysts is forecasting quarterly profits for the companies they cover. It turns out a computer model can do a better job than humans in many circumstances, according to a paper by Ryan Ball of the \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2  and Eric Ghysels of the University of North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 The economists built a model that uses real-time stock prices and macroeconomic inputs and found that for companies where analysts had a wide range of opinions the computer model's forecasting error was 10% less than the humans'. Even better at predicting earnings is a cyborg synergy that combines the \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  with the handcrafted analyst forecasts. The authors liken the teamwork to a self-driving car that assists a driver.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170807000067"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170807ed870001l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

You aren't going to be replaced by a computer.\par \par \uc2 It is more that you will have to cede your intellectual superiority to one.\par \par \uc2 The bread and butter for Wall Street analysts is forecasting quarterly profits for the companies they cover. It turns out that a computer model can do a better job than live humans in many circumstances, especially ones in which it is particularly hard to predict the future, according to a paper by Ryan Ball of the \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2  and Eric Ghysels of the University of North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 The economists built a model that uses real-time stock prices and macroeconomic inputs and found that for companies where analysts had a wide range of opinions -- especially small companies, manufacturing and tech stocks -- the computer model's forecasting error was 10% less than the humans'.\par \par \uc2 But analysts shouldn't trade in their CFAs to open a bakery just yet.\par \par \uc2 Even better at predicting earnings is a cyborg synergy that combines the \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  with hand-crafted analyst forecasts. The authors liken the teamwork to a self-driving car that assists a driver, though most drivers need less help than analysts in avoiding crackups.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170807000021"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170807ed870000j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc91}{\*\bkmkend toc91}\b \uc2 Value Investing Is in the Dumps\b0\par\par\uc2 By Steven Russolillo \par \uc2 1,006 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 August 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)\par \uc2 AWSJ\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Value investing is mired in one of its worst stretches on record, prompting concerns that the investment style favored by generations of fund managers is losing its effectiveness.\par \par \uc2 Value stocks, those that are cheaper than many peers relative to earnings or reported net worth and are typically purchased by fund managers anticipating long-term appreciation, have significantly lagged behind their growth stock counterparts so far this year, compounding a gap that has persisted since the end of the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Instead, investors have gravitated toward companies with fast earnings or price growth, such as \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Netflix Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Tesla Inc\uc2 ., and the market's price-earnings ratio has continued to rise -- a trend that many value investors contend cannot continue forever.\par \par \uc2 Stocks that look cheap relative to traditional fundamental metrics such as profit or cash flow have fallen so far out of favor that \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  in June questioned whether the markets are witnessing the death of value investing. With value investments in Europe and Asia also struggling, value funds globally are on track to post their worst performance this year relative to growth funds since before the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 The struggle for value stocks over such a prolonged period contradicts the popular investment approach coined by financial analyst Benjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, and since popularized by \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2 . The billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chairman has attracted a legion of followers who remain confident that value investing will never go out of style.\par \par \uc2 From the Great Depression to the U.S. tech bubble to the global financial crisis, the notion that a new paradigm would replace value investing has repeatedly occurred. Those predictions have almost always ended poorly.\par \par \uc2 While value investing appears to have lost some luster as the so-called FAANG stocks -- \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 ., Amazon, \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  parent \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . -- have surged in value, the most steadfast devotees to value-style investing are often the ones that benefit most in market downturns.\par \par \uc2 The market's attraction to highflying stocks punished value investors in a similar fashion in the late 1990s during the dot-com bubble. Growth stocks beat their value peers toward the end of two major bull markets that peaked in 2000 and 2007, before large market selloffs reversed the trend, putting value stocks ahead.\par \par \uc2 Some investors today worry that the longer growth stocks are viewed as nearly invincible, the worse the likely pullback will ultimately be.\par \par \uc2 "The super-stocks that lead a bull market inevitably become priced for perfection," said \uc2 Howard Marks\uc2 , the co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management who correctly predicted in January 2000 that tech and internet stocks were overheated and about to fall -- two months before the dot-com bubble burst. "And in many cases, the companies' perfection turns out eventually to be either illusory or ephemeral."\par \par \uc2 The attraction to growth stocks, investors and analysts say, stems from the low interest rates, slow economic growth and mild inflation that have gripped the world. Central banks have been accommodative for so long that they have skewed conventional investor wisdom, analysts say, benefiting firms that can generate growth.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S., the Russell 1000 Growth Index outperformed its value stock counterpart by 10 percentage points in the first half, the widest spread over that period since 2009. Over the past decade, the performance of U.S. growth stocks has been almost three times better than that of value stocks, contributing to what index fund giant State Street Global Advisors calls "the longest period of underperformance for value since the late 1940s."\par \par \uc2 Investors have pulled $116 billion from U.S. large-cap value funds over the past 10 years, according to \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 , with more than one-fourth of that outflow occurring over the past 12 months.\par \par \uc2 In Europe, the MSCI Europe Value index, which includes stocks with low valuations on metrics such as price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, gained 3% in the first six months of the year. The MSCI Europe Growth index gained 9% over the same period.\par \par \uc2 The trend also holds true in Asia, where an MSCI regional value index underperformed its growth counterpart by 10 percentage points in the first half.\par \par \uc2 "In this low-inflation, low-growth world we've become accustomed to, investors are chasing anything that has growth tied to it," says Kelman Li, an analyst at Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. "When that happens, value suffers."\par \par \uc2 Many of the largest stocks in Asia with low price-to-earnings ratios have been among the worst performers this year, he said. Yet since 1990, value stocks have actually outperformed growth. Mr. Li calls this phenomenon a "historical paradox" for investors in Asia and emerging markets, who typically search for growth.\par \par \uc2 For now, "every market in Asia screens as overvalued," Mr. Li said. "The bias toward growth continues."\par \par \uc2 Value fund managers have felt the pinch. The median value fund around the world lagged behind the median growth fund by 7 percentage points in the first half of the year, on pace for the worst underperformance since 2007, according to \uc2 eVestment\uc2 . The data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm measured actively managed value and growth funds in the U.S., Europe and Asia and found that so far this year value funds have lagged behind growth in all three regions for the first time since 2010.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, much of value's underperformance could still be cyclical. But for some who have practiced value investing throughout their careers, value stocks' time in the wilderness is starting to seem awfully long.\par \par \uc2 "This time seems very, very different," longtime value investor \uc2 Jeremy Grantham\uc2 , the co-founder and chief investment strategist at Boston money manager GMO, wrote in a recent quarterly letter. In a follow-up note, he added that valuations have stayed richer for far longer than historical cycles have previously dictated. "As a value manager, I wish it were not so."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170806000058"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170806ed870001g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

It's the Insurance Inspector; About 40% of car insurers no longer use employees to physically inspect damage in some cases\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nicole Friedman \par \uc2 1,015 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 August 2017\par 10:30\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When Melinda Roberts found shingles in her front yard after a storm, her insurer didn't dispatch a claims adjuster to investigate. It sent a drone.\par \par \uc2 The unmanned aircraft hovered above Ms. Roberts' three-bedroom Birmingham, Ala., home and snapped photos of her roof. About a week later a check from \uc2 Liberty Mutual Insurance\uc2  arrived to cover repairs.\par \par \uc2 "It took a lot less time than I was expecting," Ms. Roberts said.\par \par \uc2 Drones, photo-taking apps and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  are accelerating what has long been a clunky, time-consuming experience: the auto or home-insurance claim.\par \par \uc2 Traditionally, an insurance claim associated with minor home damage or fender-bender auto accidents started with a phone call from a customer and ended days or weeks later with a mailed check. In between the insurer often would send an inspector to investigate the situation in person.\par \par \uc2 But about four in 10 car insurers no longer use employees to physically inspect damage in some cases, according to a \uc2 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\uc2  survey of insurance executives. Claims that rely on greater automation can be handled in two to three days compared with 10 to 15 days for a more traditional approach that involves an in-person visit, according to the survey.\par \par \uc2 One new home insurer, Lemonade, drew attention in January when it said it took just three seconds for its \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  claims bot to settle and pay a claim for a stolen jacket.\par \par \uc2 Insurers typically guard their claims-handling times as industry secrets. But some said the time for a customer to get a price estimate and receive a payment is speeding up, and the change could make it more likely that policies are renewed.\par \par \uc2 A faster process can also save insurers money. About 11 cents of every premium dollar in personal property-and-casualty insurance is spent on investigating and settling claims, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\par \par \uc2 Automation can reduce the size of payouts, too. "The faster you can settle a claim, typically the less you can settle it for, so there is a direct financial incentive," said Matthew Josefowicz, chief executive of insurance-technology consulting firm Novarica. Claims like water damage can get worse if they aren't addressed quickly, he said.\par \par \uc2 Speed can have drawbacks. Some auto-repair shop industry groups have argued that photo-based appraisals can overlook significant damage and actually slow the claims process.\par \par \uc2 "It's great to speed up certain parts of the process, [but] to think that one photograph, one piece of code or one algorithm is the Holy Grail, I think is a bit of a misnomer," said Andrew Newman, president of reinsurance broker Willis Re.\par \par \uc2 Delaware, Pennsylvania and Virginia changed their regulations last year to allow appraisers to base car-repair estimates on photos or videos, but Massachusetts and Rhode Island still have some restrictions on photo appraisals.\par \par \uc2 Chicago startup Snapsheet helps car insurers with photo appraisals, using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to speed up the process. It takes up to three hours for the company to produce a price estimate after a customer submits photos of a damaged car, according to CJ Przybyl, the company's president.\par \par \uc2 For claims involving more minor damage, the processing time is expected to drop dramatically as automation continues. A car-insurance claim is currently handled by an average of three employees, said Bill Brower, vice president of claims at \uc2 RELX Group\uc2 's \uc2 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14the same number as when he started working in the industry in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 Soon, the entire claims process\u8212\'20\'14from notifying insurance companies when damage occurs to estimating repair costs based on photos\u8212\'20\'14could be done with no human input, he said. \uc2 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\uc2  helps insurers streamline their claims processes.\par \par \uc2 "We're on the cusp of this major, major change" in claims handling, Mr. Brower said. "Consumers' expectations have changed."\par \par \uc2 At Lemonade, customers already file claims by chatting with a bot through the Lemonade app, uploading relevant photos and recording videos of themselves describing the loss. The company's algorithms run 18 antifraud tests, said \uc2 Daniel Schreiber\uc2 , Lemonade's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 The New York company said about one-fourth of its claims are settled and paid automatically, with the rest being passed on to a team of humans to assess. Lemonade launched in September and now sells policies in four states.\par \par \uc2 Allstate Corp\uc2 . told car-repair shops in March that it is asking customers to send photos of car damage through its app rather than using drive-in inspection centers. The switch cut the time for a customer to get an estimate from several days to about 13 hours, an \uc2 Allstate\uc2  executive told repair shops in a May letter.\par \par \uc2 "We give customers their money in hours, not in days," Allstate Chief Executive \uc2 Tom Wilson\uc2  said in a May conference call. "It's cheaper, better and faster."\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Liberty Mutual\uc2 , adjusters are now using drones daily to photograph home damage, said Lily Wray, the company's vice president of claims innovation for U.S. consumer markets. It is one of several insurance companies that have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aig-receives-faa-approval-for-drone-use-1428499777"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 received federal approval}}}\uc2  in recent years to use or test unmanned aircraft to inspect everything from hail-damaged roofs to collapsed buildings.\par \par \uc2 "We're taking something that takes hours down to minutes," she said.\par \par \uc2 Insurers say drones will improve their ability to swiftly respond to claims from hurricanes, tornadoes and floods by providing aerial images of places claims adjusters can't always access. They also see drones as a way to reduce injuries from risky roof inspections.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Roberts, the \uc2 Liberty Mutual\uc2  customer with roof damage in Alabama, was relieved that the insurer's drone saved a claims adjuster a climb to the top of her house.\par \par \uc2 "I would much rather have it done that way than have him call me and tell me he's fallen off my roof," she said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Nicole Friedman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:nicole.friedman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 nicole.friedman@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170804ed840015q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 TaskRabbit\uc2  chief executive \uc2 Stacy Brown-Philpot\uc2  still remembers running home one day to escape a group of grade-school bullies, only to have her grandmother lock her out of the house. "She said, 'You're going to have to get through this yourself,' " Ms. Brown-Philpot says. "And I had to stand up for myself and fight."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Brown-Philpot, now 41, lost that fight with a punch in the face, but she learned a valuable lesson. "You have to learn to get through it yourself, because there are going to be times in your life when there's going to be no one else around but you," she says.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Brown-Philpot credits the lessons of her childhood, growing up in a tough neighborhood in Detroit, with helping her to succeed. In the past six months, she has expanded \uc2 TaskRabbit\uc2 , an on-demand chore service, to 21 new locations, bringing its presence to a total of 39 U.S. cities (plus London). This spring, she confirmed reports that the company is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/taskrabbit-shops-for-a-buyer-1491606423"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 exploring a potential sale}}}\uc2  after receiving unsolicited interest from a buyer.\par \par \uc2 Through the \uc2 TaskRabbit\uc2  app, users can choose a task they want done, such as assembling furniture, moving, delivering packages or cleaning. Users then get a list of local "taskers," people who are willing to do the job and have been vetted by the company, along with their hourly rate. The company takes a 30% cut of each completed task.\par \par \uc2 In the next few months, Ms. Brown-Philpot says, the company will launch a series of new partnerships, adding to its recent collaborations with \uc2 IKEA\uc2  and \uc2 Amazon\uc2 . Since it was founded in 2008, the company has raised about $38 million. Documents related to a 2015 financing round put the company's value at around $50 million. A company spokesman says that the firm is "very close to overall profitability."\par \par \uc2 Outside of \uc2 TaskRabbit\uc2 , Ms. Brown-Philpot joined the board of the department-store retailer Nordstrom in May and has been on the board of \uc2 Hewlett-Packard\uc2  since 2015.\par \par \uc2 She grew up the child of a single mother who was an insurance-claims adjuster. After graduating from the \uc2 Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\uc2 , she earned her M.B.A. from the \uc2 Stanford Graduate School of Business\uc2  and then eventually found a job in sales at \uc2 Google\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In 2009, she moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Hyderabad, India, to become senior director of Google's online and sales operations in the country. It was a difficult decision. She and her husband had been thinking about starting a family when she got the offer. At first, she turned it down, but then her husband, who also works in technology, convinced her to take the job.\par \par \uc2 A year later, she returned to the Bay Area and soon had her first child. (She and her husband now have two daughters, ages 6 and 2.) She ran \uc2 Google\uc2 's global consumer operations before becoming an entrepreneur in residence there. She joined \uc2 TaskRabbit\uc2  as its chief operations officer in 2013 and became CEO in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Today, in an industry notoriously lacking in women and minorities, Ms. Brown-Philpot is one of the few black women running a sizable technology company. She is working to increase diversity at her own firm. \uc2 TaskRabbit\uc2  works with Code2040, a nonprofit aimed at providing minorities with training, experience and internships at tech companies. She also expects recruiters to present her with a diverse list of candidates, especially for senior roles. Her goal is to raise the percentage of African-American employees at her company from its current 12% to 13% by the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 "The big problem is that a lot of Americans, whether they are underrepresented minorities or from rural areas, do not know about career opportunities in the tech industry because they may not have had role models who are part of this field or learned about STEM in school," she says. "One goal for Silicon Valley must be to redouble our collective efforts to make sure people of all backgrounds are aware of opportunities in tech."\par \par \uc2 When she's not at \uc2 TaskRabbit\uc2 , Ms. Brown-Philpot spends time with her family and enjoys exercising. Last month, she ran a half-marathon in San Francisco. She was so anxious that she could barely sleep the night before. "I've not always had as much confidence as I have now," she says, but "there are days\u8230\'20\'26even now, where I'm not sure [of myself]."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Brown-Philpot is looking to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to expand her company's range. She thinks that people will someday be able to talk to their devices to set up tasks. And appliances such as refrigerators could automatically signal to a tasker that, say, a filter needs changing.\par \par \uc2 Employees must act as a tasker every few months. That includes Ms. Brown-Philpot, though she's kept her company title hidden. One user hired her to help clean his apartment before he moved out, and asked her, "Why do you task?" She said, "Because I love making people happy. And because I just want you to get your security deposit back."\par \par \uc2 Write to Alexandra Wolfe at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170804ed84005pl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

In the time left, they are working to confirm certain Trump administration nominees. Succeeding at that goal will require something that has so far been lacking: a bit more reaching across the aisle.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of Trump administration picks, including individuals tapped for positions at the Treasury Department, \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  and other federal financial agencies, are pending before the full Senate for confirmation.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have rejected Republican efforts to quickly advance these nominees through a process known as unanimous consent. Instead, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) in most circumstances has been invoking Senate procedures to require up to 30 hours of debate per nominee, an amount of Senate floor time that means lawmakers can't confirm more than a handful of nominees each week.\par \par \uc2 That could change as early as Thursday. Senate lawmakers are eager to leave town for their summer break and the health-care bill has collapsed, opening the door to other legislative priorities. Leaders of both parties say they are hopeful they will be able to reach a deal to unanimously confirm dozens of pending nominees.\par \par \uc2 While Senate leaders have declined to say which nominees would be included in any deal, Republican aides said a package could include Kevin Hassett, President Donald Trump's pick to head the Council of Economic Advisers, as well as individuals tapped for vacancies at the Treasury, CFTC, Department of Housing and Urban Development and Commerce Department.\par \par \uc2 Though prospects for a deal are high, it's unlikely any agreement in the next week or two will include Mr. Trump's picks for the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  or the Federal Reserve, because those nominees have yet to clear the Senate Banking Committee, a crucial step before the full Senate can vote on them. As a result, it's unlikely these nominees will be confirmed until the fall, according to Senate aides.\par \par \uc2 It's far from a new era of cross-party comity. But the upshot of last week's collapse of GOP health-care legislation could mean the Senate is finally able to confirm a number of individuals to long-vacant posts\u8212\'20\'14a signal of slightly less partisanship in the chamber.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18London Whale' Has a New Target: \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 's Top Brass\par \par \uc2 By Lucy McNulty, Gregory Zuckerman and Rebecca Davis O'Brien\par \par \uc2 The U.S. case against two former \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . traders charged with concealing billions of dollars in losses fell apart because a key witness known as the London Whale shifted blame to Chief Executive Officer James Dimon and other top executives, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Four years ago, Bruno Iksil, a former J.P. Morgan trader in London, agreed to testify against ex-coworkers Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout for their roles in a 2012 trading debacle that cost the bank more than $6 billion. But over the past year, Mr. Iksil changed his story.\par \par \uc2 "I mostly inferred that Dimon and his close lieutenants were responsible much, much more than my two colleagues could ever be," Mr. Iksil said in an email, his first comments since prosecutors requested the case be dropped on July 21.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Iksil's shifting explanations about who was responsible helped end the high-profile U.S. criminal case, the person said.\par \par \uc2 On July 21, prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office filed a motion in federal court to drop the charges against Messrs. Martin-Artajo and Grout, saying the government "no longer believes that it can rely on the testimony of Iksil in prosecuting this case" after "a review of recent statements and writings made by Iksil." The office provided no other details beyond that statement.\par \par \uc2 The reversal is an unexpected turn in one of the biggest banking scandals since the end of the 2008 financial crisis. The 2012 fiasco raised questions about risk controls inside \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14which initially had dismissed the possibility of significant losses related to the trades\u8212\'20\'14and led to congressional testimony from many of the bank's top officers, including Mr. Dimon. The bank eventually paid at least $800 million in fines to regulators. "We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them," Mr. Dimon said in a September 2013 statement.\par \par \uc2 The evolution of Mr. Iksil's views over the past year were reflected on a website he created to explain his version of events; a 400-page unpublished memoir; and a letter to several publications.\par \par \uc2 The losses, Mr. Iksil wrote in a chapter of the unpublished memoir reviewed by Dow Jones & Co.'s Financial News, developed in the years after senior managers asked a London outpost of the bank known as the Chief Investment Office to reduce certain positions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Iksil never asserted that Mr. Dimon gave this initial order, but on his website, he cited a September 2010 public presentation from the CEO that predicted such reductions as a way of meeting new regulatory demands.\par \par \uc2 Even as losses mounted in 2012, valuations of those positions weren't hidden, Mr. Iksil wrote in his memoir. Instead, he wrote, they were communicated to top bank officers, suggesting to Mr. Iksil that others were fully aware of the issues.\par \par \uc2 A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman declined to comment about Mr. Iksil's allegations.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge formally closed the criminal case against Messrs. Martin-Artajo and Grout last week. Both men still face civil charges brought by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . They have denied wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Iksil in 2013 reached a deal with U.S. prosecutors to not be prosecuted in exchange for his willingness to testify. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  hasn't been charged.\par \par \uc2 The question of who was ultimately responsible for the losses was a subject of public debate after the losses came to light. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  said in its 2013 report on the episode that Mr. Dimon and the bank's chief financial officer instructed the office in late 2011 to reduce its exposure to riskier assets as a way of meeting new regulatory demands, but traders then placed inaccurate values on certain positions as they debated the size of the losses.\par \par \uc2 Top J.P. Morgan executives, including the person in charge of the office responsible for the trades, testified publicly that they were often misinformed about the positions by the firm's traders.\par \par \uc2 But a report issued by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations concluded the bank didn't express a problem with how the positions were being treated, brushed off internal warnings and misled regulators and investors about the scope of its losses. The same report, citing testimony from Mr. Iksil, stated that a decision was first made in 2010 to shrink the positions but didn't attribute that order to any specific person.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Iksil's latest version of events aligns more closely with the Senate's report. In his emailed comment, he says he looked through reports published by the Senate and \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  in 2013 as well as details of an investigation into the matter by the U.K.'s \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2 . The FCA shared those details with Mr. Iksil before it dropped its investigation of the trader in 2015, according to the FCA and Mr. Iksil.\par \par \uc2 In his email, Mr. Iksil surmised that his change hurt the U.S. case against his former colleagues. It "certainly relied on my testimony\u8230\'20\'26after reading my recent statements and writing\u8230\'20\'26the DOJ got the \u8216\'20\'18belief' that they could not proceed with the case," Mr. Iksil wrote.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Iksil said the failure of the case wasn't all due to his new stance. The case stalled, he said, because U.S. authorities weren't able to extradite Mr. Martin-Artajo, a Spanish citizen, and Mr. Grout, a French citizen.\par \par \uc2 "Extradition was impossible so far, which means that the DOJ could not proceed with its case anyway," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 When announcing they would drop the charges on July 21, federal prosecutors noted that a Spanish court had rejected a request to extradite Mr. Martin-Artajo, and said they had determined attempts to extradite Mr. Grout from France "would have been futile."\par \par \uc2 "Even if the defendants appeared," the prosecutors said, they no longer believed they could rely on Mr. Iksil's testimony.\par \par \uc2 J.P.

Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . agreed to pay $4.6 million to settle allegations it didn't properly inform people about why their account applications were denied, a federal regulator said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  said the bank was "keeping customers in the dark" about screening it conducts on potential customers using information about customer behavior that is compiled by third-party companies. Banks supplying consumer data to companies such as \uc2 Chex Systems\uc2  and Early Warning Systems are required to ensure the information is accurate.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB said Chase didn't have an accuracy process in place between 2010 and 2014 and didn't provide consumers required information about application denials and disputes.\par \par \uc2 "Since identifying the issue three years ago, we've significantly improved our procedures for sharing information with agencies," a spokeswoman for Chase said.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB said Chase, like other banks, provides information to companies that collect and report negative information about consumer checking accounts, including whether an account was closed due to an unpaid negative balance or due to suspected fraudulent activity.\par \par \uc2 Banks are required to provide consumers with the name and contact information of the company that supplied any information used to screen customers' account applications. Between October 2014 and February 2015, Chase sent denial notices to approximately 17,500 checking account applicants, according to the CFPB. These notices, it said, didn't identify the reporting company that supplied negative information Chase relied on in making account decisions.\par \par \uc2 In addition to paying the penalty, the bank agreed to implement policy changes to prevent further violations, the CFPB said.\par \par \uc2 Blast From the Past: Chicago Open Outcry Floor Wins Approval\par \par \uc2 By Gunjan Banerji\par \par \uc2 A relic of past trading days enjoyed a victory on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Box Options Exchange\uc2  won approval from the \uc2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  to launch an open outcry floor in Chicago, the first of its kind in decades.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's decision marks the end of a monthslong back and forth between Box and rival exchanges and trading firms, some of whom opposed a new physical trading floor. Box said in a statement that it anticipates launching the floor later this month at the \uc2 Chicago Board of Trade\uc2  building.\par \par \uc2 Critics argued that a new floor would further stress an already fragmented options market structure. The complex architecture has been blamed partly for causing an exodus of options market makers\u8212\'20\'14trading firms that provide continuous buy and sell quotes.

The resulting outflows have depressed the Chinese currency, prompting authorities to make moving money out more difficult.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the government introduced strict controls on acquisitions worth more than $10 billion that lie outside the purchaser's core business. Analysts say Beijing also wants to focus buying in key industries like agriculture and advanced technologies, as well as in areas that support national initiatives like President Xi Jinping's signature "One Belt One Road." That message became clear when regulators in June singled out \uc2 Wanda Group\uc2 , \uc2 HNA Group Co\uc2 ., and other large private conglomerates when conducting a check on borrowings onshore, they say.\par \par \uc2 Scrutinizing borrowings offshore further tightens the reins on spending. The collateral behind offshore financing can range from cash on borrowers' balance sheets to property, land and accounts payable, and needs an onshore banking branch to arrange.\par \par \uc2 On paper, an onshore bank looking to provide collateral-backed financing need only register with the forex regulator. That rule went into effect in 2014, part of a set of provisions that lawyers saw as relaxing controls on the nation's capital account. Now they say both banks and companies could face hurdles to engaging in collateral-backed financing.\par \par \uc2 In practice, regulators will likely ask banks for more information during registration, meaning "everything will take longer," says Jolyon Ellwood-Russell, a Hong Kong-based lawyer specializing in trade finance at Simmons and Simmons. He said the additional scrutiny may effectively leave banks waiting for approval.\par \par \uc2 The bank branch providing the loan abroad may also turn cautious, should there be worries about whether it would be able to claim the full value of the domestic collateral, said Mr. Ellwood-Russell.\par \par \uc2 "I have been cautioning clients," said one lawyer who declined to be named, adding that practices can quickly change under tightening "from the very top."\par \par \uc2 Australia's Largest Bank Breached Money-Laundering Law, Regulator Says\par \par \uc2 By Robb M. Stewart\par \par \uc2 MELBOURNE, Australia\u8212\'20\'14Australia's financial-intelligence agency accused the nation's biggest bank of failings it said may have opened the way for money laundering and financial crime.\par \par \uc2 In a civil suit filed Thursday in the federal court in Sydney, the \uc2 Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre\uc2  alleged that \uc2 Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd\uc2 . contravened the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act more than 53,700 times\u8212\'20\'14each carrying a maximum penalty of 18 million Australian dollars (US$14.3 million).\par \par \uc2 Nearly all the alleged violations were failures to make timely reports to \uc2 Austrac\uc2  of cash transactions of A$10,000 or more, as the law requires.\par \par \uc2 The bank, Australia's largest by loan volume and market value, acknowledged the lawsuit and said it would comment on the specific claims in due course.\par \par \uc2 In its court filing, the agency, known as \uc2 Austrac\uc2 , said the bank rolled out "intelligent deposit machines," a type of ATM that accepts deposits of cash and checks, in 2012 but didn't assess the money-laundering and terrorism-financing risk until mid-2015. In addition to the late reports on the large cash transactions, it said Commonwealth Bank failed to report on time or even at all millions of dollars in suspicious transactions and didn't monitor customers to manage the risks even after it became aware of suspected money laundering.\par \par \uc2 Commonwealth Bank said in a statement that it has been in discussions with \uc2 Austrac\uc2  and has cooperated fully with its requests. The bank said it has worked to continuously improve compliance, and kept the agency up-to-date on its efforts. The bank also said it reports more than 4 million transactions to \uc2 Austrac\uc2  annually in an effort to identify suspicious activity and has invested more than A$230 million in compliance and reporting systems to combat money laundering.\par \par \uc2 More than A$5.81 billion (US$4.62 billion) was deposited using the Commonwealth Bank machines in the first half of last year, \uc2 Austrac\uc2  said. They accept cash deposits of up to A$20,000, with no limit on the number of times a customer can use them daily. The machines allowed for anonymous cash deposits into Commonwealth Bank accounts, the agency said, since the bank doesn't know details of cardholders from other banks.\par \par \uc2 The court action should send companies that report to the agency a message about their obligations to fight money laundering and terrorism financing, said \uc2 Austrac\uc2 's acting chief executive, Peter Clark.\par \par \uc2 The agency said suspected money laundering was conducted through Commonwealth Bank accounts via cash deposits into the machines that were followed immediately by international and domestic transfers. In many cases, \uc2 Austrac\uc2  said, the deposits were broken into amounts small enough to avoid triggering the bank's reporting obligation. The agency alleges that the bank identified patterns of suspicious activity but failed to report instances in a timely manner, or sometimes at all.\par \par \uc2 Among the allegations, \uc2 Austrac\uc2  said that from late 2014 to August 2015 about A$20.6 million was deposited through ATMs into 30 Commonwealth Bank accounts\u8212\'20\'1429 held in fake names\u8212\'20\'14and transferred offshore. Two people have been convicted of dealing with proceeds from crime and other offenses related to the activity, it said in the court document.\par \par \uc2 As part of another alleged money-laundering syndicate, the agency said that between June 2014 and January 2015, three people deposited almost A$2.3 million into three accounts and almost immediately transferred the money domestically.\par \par \uc2 In another example, it said that between February 2015 and May 2016 more than A$21 million in cash\u8212\'20\'14allegedly illicit-drug proceeds\u8212\'20\'14was deposited into 11 accounts held at Commonwealth Bank and transferred to other domestic accounts.\par \par \uc2 In all, \uc2 Austrac\uc2  alleged the bank was late with 53,506 reports on transactions of A$10,000 or more from November 2012 to September 2015 and failed to report on time or at all suspicious transactions totaling over A$77 million.\par \par \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers\uc2  to Settle Brokerage Audit Allegations\par \par \uc2 By Michael Rapoport\par \par \uc2 Accounting firm \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\uc2  agreed Wednesday to pay $1 million to settle a regulator's allegations that its audit of Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch brokerage had been inadequate.\par \par \uc2 PwC's 2014 audit of Merrill had failed to find that the brokerage improperly left billions of dollars in customer assets exposed to creditors' claims, said the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which regulates the auditing industry.\par \par \uc2 Broker-dealers are required to hold certain customer securities in separate, safeguarded accounts to protect them from the claims of creditors if the brokerage failed.

That was down from 10.3% of $4.1 trillion in loans last year. The report is published by the Federal Reserve, \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Leveraged lending, which is typically used for corporate buyout deals, represented 65% of loans flagged as problematic. Credit tied to the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 26%.\par \par \uc2 The regulators noted that the oil-and-gas industry began a "slow, albeit volatile, recovery in late 2016," so the level of concern raised in recent years has eased somewhat. However, the regulators said they remain particularly concerned about leveraged lending, where nonbanks hold most of the riskier loans.\par \par \uc2 "Any downturn in the economy would result in a significant increase in the already considerable adversely risk rated leveraged lending exposure," the report said.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the loans flagged as problematic declined less than 1% in 2017, to $417.6 billion, from $421.4 billion in 2016.\par \par \uc2 OCC Takes Step Toward Volcker Rule Revamp\par \par \uc2 By Liz Hoffman and Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 The national bank regulator took a first step toward changing the Volcker rule trading ban, as regulators continue behind-the-scenes discussions about revamping the much-criticized regulation.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  asked for public feedback Wednesday on potential changes to the rule's definition of proprietary trading, the scope of firms subject to the rule, metrics calculated to measure banks' compliance and restricted investment funds known as "covered funds," among other topics. It asked a series of questions, including whether banks should be able to conduct "additional activities" and whether the rule should be changed to "remove unnecessary burden."\par \par \uc2 The OCC and four other regulatory agencies that enforce the rule\u8212\'20\'14the Federal Reserve, \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , and \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14have publicly committed to discuss potential changes in recent weeks, but haven't reached an agreement on specifics, according to people familiar with those discussions.\par \par \uc2 The regulatory discussions continued Friday at a meeting of the \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2  of senior regulators, where officials discussed recommendations to change the rule made by the Treasury Department in a June financial regulation report.\par \par \uc2 "During the discussion, the FSOC member agencies shared many good ideas on how the Volcker Rule could be improved," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement Tuesday. "I look forward to continuing to work with our banking and market regulators on modifying the rule."\par \par \uc2 Acting Comptroller \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2  in July said his agency could move on its own to solicit public comment on the rule, although he said he was hoping to do so jointly with other regulators. On Wednesday, he called the move to seek public input "one piece of a larger interagency effort to improve the rule."\par \par \uc2 "A bipartisan consensus has emerged that the Volcker rule needs clarification and recalibration," he said in a statement. "Regulators do not have a monopoly on good ideas."\par \par \uc2 The agency's information request lasts for 45 days, giving bankers and others a public forum to suggest changes.\par \par \uc2 The Volcker rule is one of several Obama-era rules in play as the U.S. undertakes a broad review of regulations adopted after the 2008 financial crisis. Others under scrutiny include big bank stress tests and a Labor Department rule governing retirement advice.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration has said it supports the goal of the Volcker rule, which is designed to ensure that taxpayer-insured banks aren't using customers' money to make hedge-fund-like speculative bets.\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0BIt was mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, but that law left it to the five regulatory agencies to agree on the rule's fine print, a process that took several years. The rule went into effect in July 2015.\par \par \uc2 The June Treasury report said that in practice, "the rule has spawned an extraordinarily complex and burdensome compliance regime." Regulators appointed by President Donald Trump and Mr. Obama have agreed with that sentiment.\par \par \uc2 Bankers and regulators say they have struggled to define the line between a speculative trade and a transaction intended to serve clients. Banks are using regulator-approved metrics to track whether traders are buying and selling securities commensurate with customers' expected demand, but that expensive and time-consuming process often yields more questions than answers, they say.\par \par \uc2 The rule also has created a complex legal calculus for deciding what types of investment funds are permissible for banks to own.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, liberal groups that support the rule have questioned whether the process for measuring compliance is actually preventing banks from engaging in risky activities.\par \par \uc2 Regulators could move to ease the rule in several ways, from relaxing its record-keeping requirements to giving banks more leeway when potential violations arise.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Senate Committee Approves CFTC Nominees\par \par \uc2 The Senate Agriculture Committee approves three nominees\u8212\'20\'14two Republicans and one Democrat\u8212\'20\'14to serve as commissioners on the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 .

That's because the humans who write public company and investment adviser disclosure documents will start to adapt to detection patterns, a move that will affect the information investors receive, he says.

Increasingly, large companies are hiring cybersecurity experts to advise their boards on the best ways to stop data breaches before they occur.\par \par \uc2 Top financial service institutions and other Fortune 500 players are bringing in security pros to advise their boards. Now, as regulations look increasingly likely, many more small- and medium-sized businesses could follow suit.\par \par \uc2 In March, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators proposed the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act, which would require public companies to share details of governing body cybersecurity expertise as part of their \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  filings. If the bill progresses into law, it would promote cybersecurity risk management priorities in the same way the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law encouraged board-level finance expertise.\par \par \uc2 But the bill's implication is already clear: a lack of cybersecurity expertise could decrease investor confidence in an organization's cyberrisk management abilities, and affect an organization's ability to recover from the inevitable data breach.\par \par \uc2 At the heart of the issue is communication disconnect between security executives and the board. In too many companies, cybersecurity risk has not been adequately translated into terms a board can understand.\par \par \uc2 That language barrier has contributed to a lack of security awareness, even as breaches continue to plague international companies. A dearth of talent able to operate and communicate effectively at board-level has also created delays for many companies seeking to improve their own situation.\par \par \uc2 "Too many companies view cybersecurity as a technology problem. They lose sight of the broader issue of enterprise risk," said Gregory Touhill, the first federal chief information security officer and author of the book "Cybersecurity for Executives, A Practical Guide."\par \par \uc2 Organizations oftentimes utilize their CISO as a board advisor. This can be an unsatisfactory experience, though, when the CISO is also expected to report to the board on cyberrisk issues.\par \par \uc2 "I think there is value for larger companies, particularly those engaged in critical infrastructure activities, but that may not be a good fit for small and medium sized businesses," said Mr. Touhill, who now works as president of Cyxtera Technologies, a secure infrastructure company and soon-to-be board member of cyber \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company, Bay Dynamics Inc.\par \par \uc2 Meeting the demand for expertise, and ensuring those experts really are capable, will be a challenge, according to Mr. Touhill. He pointed to professional training and certification as a significant part of the answer for small- and medium-sized businesses.\par \par \uc2 "Not having that access could sink a company," he said.\par \par \uc2 Board Education Opportunities\par \par \uc2 Both the \uc2 National Association of Corporate Directors\uc2  and Carnegie Mellon University now offer cybersecurity oversight programs aimed at boosting the skill level of directors and arming the next generation of board advisors with skills to articulate, measure and manage enterprise cyberrisk.\par \par \uc2 "Board members today are actively engaged in re-architecting their business strategy to incorporate a cybersecurity vision that breaks down siloes, protects endpoints seamlessly, and ultimately stops the mega breach," said George Kurtz, chief executive of the cybersecurity vendor Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. and a strategic advisor to \uc2 Banco Santander S.A\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Information security needs to be translated from bits and bytes to conversations about risk management, brand protection, defense of business intelligence, and customer retention."\par \par \uc2 (Rob Sloan is cybersecurity research director at WSJ Pro.
