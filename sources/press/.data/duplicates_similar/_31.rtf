As recruiters embrace such technologies to sift candidates, I took a test that is given to entry-level bank analysts. I wanted to discover whether AI would be better at selecting women than an interviewer used to hiring young, male graduates from Oxford and Harvard - or would it replicate the bias against women and minorities?\par \par \uc2 Koru, which counts \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  and \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  among its clients, surveys employees to discover their strengths and weaknesses. The software asks questions for which there is no obvious answer, such as "Which sounds more like you? - 'I will be able to achieve most of the goals that I have set for myself', or 'In uncertain times, I usually expect the best' ".\par \par \uc2 The AI hiring company then asks applicants to take similar tests to see if they fit the organisation. Koru says these qualities can vary significantly between organisations, with most investment bankers in the same company having more skills in common than they would share with those in other banks.\par \par \uc2 Josh Jarrett\uc2  , co-founder and chief product officer of Koru, believes AI can help employers to find candidates that have skills that go unrecognised because of the current hiring process.\par \par \uc2 "What I was excited to see is that women outperformed on several of those sub-competencies, [such as] emotional intelligence and teamwork, which is a notoriously hard thing to measure," says Mr Jarrett. Employers are more likely to interview those with a "high fit" score, so women may gain points for skills that do not come across as easily on a CV.\par \par \uc2 A new generation of AI recruitment technologies have been invented by companies from start-ups to \uc2 Google\uc2 . The latter says it built its \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  model using 17m job postings. Many sell their software as a way to bypass human bias, but they are also aware they need to keep an eye on their algorithms in case they, too, are biased.\par \par \uc2 AI is like a child imitating its parents' behaviour rather than doing what they say. It sucks in data, finds patterns and copies them. Although employers may say they want diversity, a recruitment programcould instead follow the pattern of employers' human systems.\par \par \uc2 For example, if an AI tool examines data about a company's workforce - their experience, skills and performance - it could increase the number of white men if that is the trend, rather than considering more diverse candidates. If the people behind the AI have those same biases, that could also perpetuate them.\par \par \uc2 "We know that AI is not neutral," says Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of a start-up called ReadySet , which is dev-oted to increasing diversity in technology companies. "AI is designed by people and those people have their own biases, and sometimes those biases get embedded into the tools and the platforms they use."\par \par \uc2 AI already has its first cautionary tale, she says. Some US courts started using predictive software to decide when to give prisoners parole, by calculating their risk of reoffending in a more consistent way. An investigation by \uc2 ProPublica\uc2  , the non-profit journalism organisation, found it was biased against African Americans, wrongly labelling them as future criminals at almost twice the rate of white defendants.\par \par \uc2 "What was supposed to be a bias mitigation tool ended up being a bias exacerbation tool. We risk seeing that happening in the hiring space as well," Ms Hutchinson says.\par \par \uc2 A Toronto start-up called Ideal uses AI to find thousands of candidates for entry-level positions. The start-up employs psychologist Ji-A Min as its head data scientist to monitor the decisions made by the software. The aim is to try to ensure that clients can comply with diversity rules, such as the \uc2 US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\uc2  's regulations.\par \par \uc2 "Telling humans to ignore their unconscious bias is virtually impossible," she says. "Because the AI is training on historical data about human decision-making, it can start to replicate human bias if you are not monitoring the system. So if there is some kind of . . . bias, we go in and correct the principles we use."\par \par \uc2 As an African-American woman from a poor background, Stephanie Lampkin, chief executive of Blendoor , says she understands the potential negative effect of using historical data. She says there can be "accountability" problems and no real "quality assurance".\par \par \uc2 Her start-up is using data and AI to check the bias of human recruiters. Individual hiring managers are told if and when they tend to favour a certain type of candidate so they can be held accountable for their choices. "They can dig deeper and show [that] you favour white men between 25 and 30 who graduated from Stanford and have this degree," she says. Blendoor can recommend steps to correct the bias, such as attending a careers fair at a women's college or sponsoring an event at a conference focused on diversity.\par \par \uc2 On completing the Koru test, I was not convinced it had uncovered hidden skills to help an employer make an unbiased decision, matching me to the qualities it values rather than the white, male faces they see in the corridor.\par \par \uc2 I scored most highly on "polish", otherwise known as communication skills, "curiosity" and "grit". I did badly on rigour - I sometimes make decisions based on gut feeling - and ownership (I apparently may be focused on my own success ahead of the team).\par \par \uc2 Luckily, my current team did not agree, so I will not have to submit to an AI recruiter any time soon.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170927ed9r0001m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

By Sujeet Indap\par \par \uc2 It was a throwaway line in an early 2009 speech from the newly inaugurated President Barack Obama. Under pressure to convey populist anger about Wall Street bailouts, he offered a glib admonition towards the banking sector: "You can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer's dime."\par \par \uc2 For America's biggest gaming empire, \uc2 Harrah's Entertainment\uc2 , the rebuke could not have come at a worse time. A year earlier, Harrah's had been taken over in a bold $31bn leveraged buyout by Apollo Global Management and TPG, two private equity pioneers. They paid a 31 per cent premium for the later renamed \uc2 Caesars Entertainment\uc2  - honouring its best-known property, Las Vegas' Caesars Palace. The high price reflected the belief that casinos had stood resilient in earlier recessions.\par \par \uc2 But by 2015, Caesars filed for bankruptcy protection , weighed down by $24bn of debt. Convention business, the lifeblood of Las Vegas, dried up as the financial sector steered clear of Nevada. Casino owners never forgot Mr Obama's dig and partially blamed their subsequent financial woes on it.\par \par \uc2 The Caesars bankruptcy has been one of the nastiest corporate brawls in recent memory. Caesars debtholders - led by \uc2 Elliott Management\uc2 , Appaloosa Management and Oaktree Capital - accused the private equity firms of "unimaginably brazen looting" in the years after the 2008 buyout.\par \par \uc2 The creditors, described by one member of the buyout group as the "smartest debt investors in the world", alleged that the private equity owners had methodically siphoned Caesars' crown jewel properties to other entities they owned to salvage what ever value remained for themselves. Apollo and TPG insisted that they had battled to keep Caesars alive so it could fight another day.\par \par \uc2 The allegations of impropriety gained enough legal traction that Apollo's co-founder \uc2 Marc Rowan\uc2  and TPG co-founder \uc2 David Bonderman\uc2  were ordered by a court last year to produce personal financial documents showing their ability to meet billions of dollars of potential personal judgments against them. Jim Millstein, the company's banker, said in a 2015 court hearing that the fight could degenerate into "one of the great messes of our time".\par \par \uc2 But while the Masters of the Universe were busy swapping accusations, Las Vegas quietly recovered. With a former casino owner now occupying the White House , finance and tech gatherings regularly roll into town, attracting thousands who want to eat, party, gamble, take in a show and forget the real world.\par \par \uc2 A Sin City renaissance had injected so much life into the core Caesars business - operating profit is up by half in three years - that the only reasonable choice for the warring factions was to settle the costly legal fight.\par \par \uc2 A slimmer, revitalised Caesars emerges from bankruptcy in the next week valued at perhaps $25bn, not far from its sale price in 2008.\par \par \uc2 In the end, the debtholders held all the aces, although the private equity firms will be allowed to keep a piece of the action. But, for all the wrangling and lawsuits, the fortuitous outcome is a result of the less flashy work of repairing an underlying business.\par \par \uc2 Protecting the equity\par \par \uc2 "The casino business has this mathematical beauty to it. But nobody was using it," explained Gary Loveman , who went from a Harvard Business School professor who consulted for Caesars in the 1990s to being the company's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Mr Loveman's insights from collecting the gambling, dining and lodging habits of Caesars customers led to the creation of a loyalty programme called Total Rewards. Gamblers could rack up points by betting at Caesars' small-time casinos in Illinois or Mississippi, then use those points at glitzier resorts in Las Vegas or Atlantic City.\par \par \uc2 His \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  initiative was a smash. By 2007, Caesars, which had started out 70 years earlier as a single bingo hall in Reno, Nevada, had accumulated more than 50 properties in the US. Annual group revenue exceeded $12bn.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, the chain attracted the interest of Apollo and TPG, which were involved in the push by private equity firms to do once inconceivable leveraged buyouts of large, listed companies. At $31bn, Caesars ranks as the seventh-biggest LBO in American history.\par \par \uc2 "We thought we had the ability to use more leverage than public companies were comfortable with so the overall cost of capital was lower. In retrospect, this [arbitrage] should not be what PE is all about," says an executive at one prominent financial investor, explaining the 2004-08 LBO binge.\par \par \uc2 Led by Apollo and TPG, the equity investors would contribute $6bn of equity towards Caesars. Smaller members of the group included the industrialist James Packer , \uc2 Robert Kraft\uc2  , the owner of the \uc2 New England Patriots\uc2 , and even Steven Mnuchin, now the US Treasury secretary.\par \par \uc2 Apollo and TPG have consistently denied any charges of wrongdoing, maintaining they acted consistent with their duties. The creditor groups declined to comment for this story.\par \par \uc2 The deal's closing in 2008 was just in time for the onset of the financial crisis. The collapse of tourism and conventions contributed to annual revenue falling at Caesars by a fifth between 2007 and 2009. The company faced nearly $2bn in annual interest payments, which alone exceeded its cash generation. With Apollo effectively calling the shots, Caesars tried different tactics which led to the subsequent legal free-for-all.\par \par \uc2 "Apollo founders are famously difficult people," says one long-time executive who had worked closely with Apollo for years, referring to \uc2 Leon Black\uc2  , \uc2 Joshua Harris\uc2  , \uc2 Marc Rowan\uc2  and others who met at \uc2 Michael Milken\uc2 's Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank in the 1980s. "Their duty is to the equity and they will do anything legally they can do to defend that equity."\par \par \uc2 Between 2011 and 2014, Caesars - at the behest of Apollo - began selling off portions of its intellectual property and Las Vegas properties including \uc2 Planet Hollywood\uc2 , \uc2 Bally\uc2 's, Linq/Octavius, the Quad and the Cromwell. The buyers of all those assets: none other than entities controlled by Apollo and TPG.\par \par \uc2 For Caesars' private equity owners, the billions in proceeds kept Caesars afloat. While Mr Rowan was the most senior Apollo executive involved at Caesars, the day-to-day management was left to a young Apollo investor, \uc2 David Sambur\uc2 , who had joined the firm in 2004 in his mid-20s. While considered analytically brilliant, his bare-knuckle negotiating tactics wore thin on others.\par \par \uc2 "Sambur is one of the most difficult human beings I have ever dealt with," says one veteran restructuring specialist about the Apollo executive's negotiating tactics over Caesars. "He was like the cat with the cheese. He would make an offer one day and retract it the next." One creditor said that it was not uncommon for Mr Sambur to storm out of negotiating sessions, leaving the others in the room confused about the status of the talks. Apollo declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Creditors of the primary Caesars operating company saw the parade of asset sales not as life-saving manoeuvres but as craven asset stripping: a "Good Caesars" had been created that seized the best properties on behalf of Apollo and TPG, leaving the loan and bondholders the weakest assets that could not satisfy debts.\par \par \uc2 Lawsuits amid restructuring\par \par \uc2 Lawsuits began in 2014 over the asset sales and accompanying terminations of bond guarantees made by the Caesars parent company. In early 2015, Caesars filed for Chapter 11 protection in Illinois, where it had casinos.\par \par \uc2 That meant that Caesars was fighting a creditor war on two fronts: on the one hand, it was contesting the spiralling litigation in multiple venues and, on the other, working to strike a consensual restructuring to take advantage of the recovering Las Vegas. By 2016, Caesars had rallied support with debtholders that represented $14bn of the operating company's $18bn in debt.\par \par \uc2 The key remaining adversaries: David Tepper's Appaloosa and \uc2 Howard Marks\uc2 ' Oaktree, formidable hedge funds that had accumulated stakes in Caesars' junior "second-lien bonds" and had clashed before with Apollo at other companies.\par \par \uc2 Caesars' initial offer to this group in 2015 was a recovery of 9 cents on the dollar, each cent representing roughly $50m. In American law, the concept of "cramdown" allows a bankruptcy judge to overrule holdout creditors blocking an otherwise reasonable deal.\par \par \uc2 But Apollo's plan to isolate and cram down the junior bondholder group flopped. Richard Davis, a former Watergate counsel and federal prosecutor, had been appointed as an independent examiner to investigate the claims of fraudulent asset sales at Caesars after its LBO. Mr Davis concluded in 2016 that there was significant evidence of as much as $5bn worth of fraudulent transfers executed by Caesars' management and board. Liability for these transfers flowed up as far as board members including Mr Loveman, Mr Bonderman and Mr Rowan.\par \par \uc2 While the fraud lawsuits were automatically paused because of the bankruptcy proceedings, the separate lawsuits against the parent Caesars company over bond guarantee terminations continued with more than $10bn in possible liability. Apollo had been successful in getting Benjamin Goldgar, the Illinois bankruptcy judge, to pause those trials in order to let the parties strike a restructuring deal.\par \par \uc2 By late summer, Judge Goldgar lost his patience with the private equity firms and allowed the bond guarantee trials to proceed. He noted that the offer on the table from Apollo and TPG allowed the two to contribute virtually no money of their own to the new Caesars while getting complete releases in liability from fraud and other wrongdoing claims.\par \par \uc2 "Particularly disturbing is that [neither TPG nor Apollo] is making any financial contribution to the reorganisation although the proposed plan would release all claims against them," he said.\par \par \uc2 In September, he ordered Mr Loveman, Mr Bonderman and Mr Rowan to begin providing personal financial statements. The ownership group capitulated last autumn . The parent Caesars entity controlled by the equity sponsor group agreed to put $6bn into the restructured company, including handing back most of their equity ownership in Caesars to the overall creditor group.\par \par \uc2 "Maybe they could have gotten away with two or three of these asset sales," says one creditor. "But if you rob a bank nine times, on the tenth time the cops will probably show up."\par \par \uc2 The initial 9 cents on the dollar offer to the junior bond group was increased to 66 cents, comprised of cash and a stake in the new Caesars. That debt has now traded up to above 90 cents. The Caesars stock that trades publicly has almost doubled this year. Both securities demonstrate the enthusiasm for the sleeker Caesars in a revitalised Las Vegas. The sliver of equity, just under 20 per cent, which Apollo and TPG were allowed to keep is worth nearly $2bn.\par \par \uc2 TPG's Caesars headache has been replaced by another at Uber. Mr Bonderman was forced to resign from the board after an insensitive remark to fellow director, Arianna Huffington .\par \par \uc2 Times are better for Apollo, which this year raised a $25bn buyout fund, the largest in history. Its shares are the best performing among listed US private equity firms in the past two years. Several rivals are increasingly willing to replicate its hardball tactics in their own creditor negotiations.\par \par \uc2 By 2016, most of the key indicators of Las Vegas tourism, such as visitors and rooms occupied, were ahead of their pre-crisis peaks. But now, gambling accounts for less than half of casino revenue with tourists and convention goers clamouring for entertainment and high-end dining. Britney Spears first and now Jennifer Lopez have had successful residencies at Caesars properties; chefs including Gordon Ramsay, Nobu and Mr Chow have franchises.\par \par \uc2 Since the January 2015 bankruptcy filing, the company has not made any interest payments and has ploughed that cash into refreshing its properties, with virtually all of its 25,000 rooms set to be renovated by 2020.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the biggest sign of the city's revival came from the Obama administration itself. In May, the annual hedge fund conference put on in the city by \uc2 Anthony Scaramucci\uc2 , the Wall Street provocateur and shortlived White House official , was full of investors giddy about the presidency of Donald Trump, the erstwhile casino tycoon. Giving a keynote speech was none other than \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , Mr Obama's vice-president.\par \par \uc2 Casino players\par \par \uc2 Gary Loveman\par \par \uc2 Former Caesars CEO.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Ford Motor Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Lyft Inc\uc2 . said Wednesday they would develop self-driving vehicles for the ride-hailing service, adding to a growing number of alliances between auto makers and tech companies jockeying for control of the road.\par \par \uc2 The two companies plan to design software that lets \uc2 Ford\uc2  vehicles communicate with Lyft's app-based services. Lyft, based in San Francisco, is playing catch-up in some respects to its larger crosstown rival, \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 ., which has been testing robot cars in Pittsburgh, Tempe, Ariz., and parts of California beginning a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Lyft has struck a series of partnerships with companies developing the technology, including \uc2 Waymo\uc2 , the self-driving car unit of \uc2 Google\uc2  parent \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Tata Motors Ltd\uc2 .'s \uc2 Jaguar Land Rover\uc2  and startups Drive.ai and \uc2 NuTonomy Inc\uc2 . And it is forming its own autonomous-car development division, which will be staffed by hundreds of engineers and technicians at a new office in Palo Alto, Calif. Lyft plans to develop its own software and hardware to enable vehicles to maneuver without a human at the wheel.\par \par \uc2 Lyft also has a partnership with \uc2 Ford\uc2  rival \uc2 General Motors Co\uc2 ., which invested about $500 million in the company and added a board member. Last year, \uc2 GM\uc2  said it planned to work with Lyft to put self-driving taxis on the road sometime this year using technology acquired from startup Cruise Automation in a $1 billion deal.\par \par \uc2 A Lyft spokeswoman said the \uc2 GM\uc2  agreement wasn't exclusive.\par \par \uc2 Last month, new Ford Chief Executive \uc2 Jim Hackett{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ford-ceo-hints-at-changes-in-auto-makers-self-driving-plans-1503004177"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 said his company was evaluating}}}\uc2  how it could deploy fully autonomous vehicles within the next four years. The Dearborn, Mich., company aims to have vehicles with no steering wheels or pedals and no need for a human driver.\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Ford\uc2  plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years into Argo AI, an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  company, in which it acquired a majority stake in February.\par \par \uc2 Lyft, meanwhile, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabet-said-to-be-in-talks-to-invest-about-1-billion-in-lyft-1505435109"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 is considering accepting a roughly $1 billion investment from Alphabet}}}\uc2 , people familiar with the matter have said. It points to the complicated web of relationships in ride hailing, as \uc2 Google\uc2  is also an investor in Uber.\par \par \uc2 Lyft was last valued at about $7.5 billion and has raised about $2.6 billion from investors.\par \par \uc2 Write to Greg Bensinger at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:greg.bensinger@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 greg.bensinger@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170927ed9r000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The company says insured losses for Hurricane Harvey are currently estimated at about $650 million pre-tax. Losses for Hurricane Irma are expected to range from $800 million to $950 million pre-tax. The estimates are net of reinsurance, include reinstatement premiums and losses from the company's commercial, personal and casualty-insurance businesses and its reinsurance operations. (Austen.Hufford@wsj.com; @austenhufford)\par \par \uc2 Impact Investments With Liquidity Still Scarce\par \par \uc2 More millennial clients are asking about impact investing, investing with the intention of generating social and environmental impact while still generating a competitive return. But opportunities to invest, particularly in liquid investments, remain scarce, says Ernest Dawal Jr., chief investment officer, private wealth management and institutional investment solutions, at SunTrust. The area is still developing and many of the companies involved\u8212\'20\'14which include businesses involved with creating housing for the poor, solar wind technology, green energy technology, water technology and education\u8212\'20\'14are smaller, privately held companies that need capital, he says. As a result, many of the investments available now are private-capital or private-equity investments for qualified purchasers only, he says. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)\par \par \uc2 Insurance Startup Offers No-Deductible Policies\par \par \uc2 Renters-insurance startup Lemonade launches policies in Texas, California and Illinois that offer no deductibles and no price increases after filing claims. Those policies will cost about $10/month more than a typical Lemonade policy, a spokeswoman says. The startup is small but closely watched within the insurance industry. In its announcement, Lemonade says that other insurers try to discourage policyholders from filing small claims, but Lemonade doesn't incur the same costs processing those claims because it uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to handle some of them. (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)\par \par \uc2 PayPal\uc2  May Be on the Hunt For Acquisitions\par \par \uc2 PayPal\uc2  will likely make a strategic acquisition in the coming months, and the top candidates include US payments firms Square and Stripe and European payments startups \uc2 Adyen BV\uc2  and \uc2 Klarna AB\uc2 , analysts at Bernstein write. They say the recent merger announcement of payments processors \uc2 Vantiv\uc2  and \uc2 Worldpay\uc2  as well as a strategic investment that Visa made into \uc2 Klarna\uc2  this summer have made a \uc2 PayPal\uc2  acquisition "more urgent." Expanding \uc2 PayPal\uc2 's geographic footprint deeper into continental Europe will likely be a focus of any deal but would come with a price tag of more than $5 billion for Adyen or more than $2.5 billion for \uc2 Klarna\uc2 , the analysts write. They also say there's a low likelihood \uc2 PayPal\uc2  would be acquired by Amazon, Apple, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  or Alphabet's \uc2 Google\uc2  because of an "unclear deal rationale." (peter.rudegeair@wsj.com; @rudegeair)\par \par \uc2 JPM Ordered to Pay More Than $4B in Case To Be Appealed\par \par \uc2 A Dallas jury ordered \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase\uc2  to pay more than $4 billion in damages for mishandling the estate of a former American Airlines executive, but it's possible the verdict will be knocked down on appeal. Jo Hopper and two stepchildren won the probate court verdict over claims that \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase\uc2  mismanaged the administration of the more than $19 million estate of Max Hopper. The estate had no last will and testament. Large punitive damages verdicts are often scaled back since they can't be disproportionate to actual damages. In this case, the jury awarded less than $5 million in actual damages. \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase\uc2  says it's "highly confident the verdict will not stand under Texas law," because it "far exceeds any possible interpretation of Texas tort reform statutes." It also says it acted in a "professional manner and in good faith in administering this estate." (emily.glazer@wsj.com; @EmilyGlazerWSJ)\par \par \uc2 No Follow-Up Credit Line For Greece Next Year\par \par \uc2 The Greek government is highly likely to exit its bailout program next August without a follow-up credit line, says Mujtaba Rahman, European head of political-risk consulting firm \uc2 Eurasia Group\uc2  in a note. "The most probable post-bailout framework will be \u8216\'20\'18enhanced surveillance' under the Eurozone's so-called two pack; neither an enhanced nor a precautionary European stability mechanism credit line is likely," he says. According to Eurasia, elections in Greece are not expected to take place before the bailout program is completed, as the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will use the country's successful exit as his narrative to recover in the polls and win re-election. However it adds there is a risk of "another high-profile spat" between the country's European creditors and the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2 . (nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Pick Hong Kong Banks Over Their Regional Peers\par \par \uc2 Hong Kong lenders remain the preferred banking picks in the region, says \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 , on the back of their margin expansion, benign asset quality and growth acceleration amidst an improving economic outlook. Top picks are Hang Seng Bank and BOC Hong Kong, given that they are most sensitive to a pickup in Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates. Meanwhile, the broker is more neutral on names with more regional exposure, such as \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and Standard Chartered. Hitting an all-time high again on Wednesday, \uc2 Hang Seng Bank\uc2  is up 0.6% in late trading, while other banks are slightly lower.

Their reason: He runs a different company and sits on two other boards.\par \par \uc2 After about 56% of voting shares were cast against Mr. Havner remaining an AvalonBay Communities Inc. director, he said he would resign, an offer rejected by the rest of the AvalonBay board. \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 .'s money-management unit were among the large investors that voted against his re-election.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Havner, who is chief executive of Public Storage, also decided not to stand for re-election at \uc2 California Resources Corp\uc2 .'s 2018 annual meeting "due to concerns raised by investors relating to the time commitment required" for those roles, the company said in a regulatory filing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Havner "has taken steps to reduce the number of boards upon which he serves," said a lawyer for Public Storage and PS Business Parks Inc., a related company.\par \par \uc2 Major institutional investors, governance advisers and boards themselves are cracking down on so-called overboarding, trying to ensure that directors don't spread themselves too thin. Overstretched directors lack time to adequately monitor management, these critics contend.\par \par \uc2 "There is no good reason for having an overboarded director," said Charles Elson, head of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the \uc2 University of Delaware\uc2 . He expects institutional-investor pressure will make S&P 500 board members with at least five seats a dying breed.\par \par \uc2 Many directors who serve multiple boards contend that they adequately manage their time and can handle their board responsibilities.\par \par \uc2 A new analysis of S&P 500 chief executives for The Wall Street Journal by \uc2 Equilar\uc2 , a research firm, suggests that leaders with multiple outside corporate board seats and their employers make more money, but their shareholders see lower returns than those with one or zero outside directorships.\par \par \uc2 Money managers such as \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  and \uc2 State Street\uc2 , with large index-tracking fund businesses, are gaining more power over shareholder votes because they own growing stakes in so many publicly held corporations. Both voted against Mr. Havner's Avalon Bay re-election in each of the past two years.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world's largest asset manager, cast 168 votes against directors this year because of overboarding concerns. It fought the re-election of directors at companies such as \uc2 Charter Communications Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Pfizer Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 PayPal Holdings, Inc\uc2 ., according to filings and a spokesman for the money manager.\par \par \uc2 "The directors that serve on many boards tend to be very strong directors," said Zach Oleksiuk, head of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's Americas corporate governance and responsible investment team. "The issue is not necessarily their performance, but rather the time that it takes to serve."\par \par \uc2 Being a director is lucrative, time-consuming and often comes with a high profile. Median total compensation for U.S. public board members was $191,440 last year, according to the \uc2 National Association of Corporate Directors\uc2  and pay consultants Pearl Meyer & Partners LLC, up about 3% from the prior year.\par \par \uc2 Board members at public companies spend an average of 245 hours a year for each position, up from 191 hours in 2005, according to surveys by the NACD.\par \par \uc2 Influential proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and \uc2 Glass, Lewis & Co\uc2 . now recommend investors vote against or withhold support from directors who sit on more than five public-company boards. \uc2 ISS\uc2  lowered that threshold to five in February from six. Each firm also favors limits on the number of outside directorships CEOs can hold.\par \par \uc2 American corporations increasingly have imposed their own restrictions. About 77% of S&P 500 companies now curb board members' outside directorships in some fashion, up from 71% in 2010, according to \uc2 Spencer Stuart\uc2 , an executive-search firm. Among those with limits for all directors, 36% now impose a cap of three seats -- up from 29% in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Overall, 63 S&P 500 directors now serve on five or more public boards, as of Sept. 10, down from 83 in 2012, according to ISS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the data arm of \uc2 Institutional Shareholder Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some directors were re-elected this year despite opposition from some large shareholders. For example, \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  withheld support for the re-election of \uc2 Ann Mather\uc2  at \uc2 Shutterfly Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 ., but she was re-elected at both companies.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mather also serves on the board of three other West Coast public companies: \uc2 Arista Networks Inc\uc2 .; \uc2 Netflix Inc\uc2 .; and \uc2 Glu Mobile Inc\uc2 . She deliberately chose businesses in the same or related industries with headquarters near each other, one person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 The person said this week that the businesses are "all connected and relevant," which means Ms. Mather "can easily add value and [has] a strategic understanding of what's going on."\par \par \uc2 Another big index-fund manager, Vanguard Group, doesn't explicitly put a limit on the number of boards on which someone can serve but looks at factors such as board members' "attendance, engagement and effectiveness," a spokeswoman said.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw553\pich453\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal8295\pichgoal6795

The round values the company "in the hundreds of millions", according to a person familiar with the matter, who would not be more specific.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2012 by Shaul Olmert, the son of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Playbuzz began life as an online publishing platform allowing users to create their own lists and quizzes, typically designed to be shared across social media.\par \par \uc2 The company has since built a more robust suite of digital content creation and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools designed to help professional publishers and marketers create more interactive and engaging content, such as polls, quizzes, "swipeable" slideshows, videos and more.\par \par \uc2 Those tools are typically offered free as long as they aren't used to create sponsored content, and are now being used by 13,000 publishers and brands, including \uc2 Time Inc\uc2 , ABC, HuffPost, BBC, MailOnline and Wall Street Journal-parent News Corp., the company said.\par \par \uc2 Playbuzz is using those publisher relationships to generate revenue through a branded content ad network, through which it has created and distributed sponsored posts for companies such as \uc2 American Express\uc2 , Netflix, \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2 , \uc2 Unilever\uc2 , Ford and others. Publishers receive a share of revenue from sponsored posts they run.\par \par \uc2 According to Mr. Olmert, Playbuzz's software is attractive to publishers and editors because it gives them presentation capabilities their own content management systems may not. Editors can create content using Playbuzz tools and easily embed it on their own properties, the company says.\par \par \uc2 For marketers, Playbuzz says, its content can offer greater engagement than other online ad offerings such as banners, and has an average "interaction time" of over two minutes.\par \par \uc2 "Publishers talk about this a lot, but they're not always doing it," Mr. Olmert said, referring to publishers developing in-house tools similar to those offered by Playbuzz. "They have some toolsets, but generally speaking I think there's a big need in the market, which we're trying to address."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Olmert said the new round of investment will be used to invest in three main areas: video creation tools, \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  systems to help publishers create content more efficiently, and ways to use the data it collects to better target content and advertising to readers.\par \par \uc2 Playbuzz said it also plans to use the new investment to broaden its global footprint. The company currently employs 150 people in 7 offices across 6 countries including in New York, London, Tel Aviv, Hamburg, Sao Paulo, Moscow and Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 The company previously announced a $15M round of strategic funding in 2016 led by Saban Ventures with participation from \uc2 The Walt Disney Company\uc2  and existing investors 83North, Carmel Ventures and Firstime.\par \par \uc2 Prior to that it raised $16 million in a 2015 round led by 83North.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jack Marshall at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Jack.Marshall@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jack.Marshall@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170927ed9r000b5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Still, he left the door open to tweaks that might give brokers a partial victory in their efforts to scale back {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/flash-crash-overhaul-is-snarled-in-red-tape-1430868811"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the project}}}\uc2 , known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-to-vote-on-consolidated-audit-trail-to-detect-market-manipulation-1479240411"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Consolidated Audit Trail}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I don't think a full time-out on the CAT makes sense," the SEC chief said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. "There is a lot of data that already exists, can be collected, that will further our oversight and regulatory mission."\par \par \uc2 To be fair, Mr. Clayton didn't rule out the possibility of scaling back aspects of the system, such as reducing the amount of personal information it will collect. The issue is bound to resurface when the SEC chief appears before the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  next week.\par \par \uc2 The CAT would keep track of every trade and order in U.S. stock and option markets. It is designed to help the SEC {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303919504577520723010703272"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 analyze complex market events such as "flash crashes,"}}}\uc2  as well as detect manipulation and insider trading. The database will begin receiving data from stock exchanges in November following a multiyear push by the SEC, which approved the plan last year. The system will include personal information on stockbrokers' customers, such as Social Security numbers and dates of birth.\par \par \uc2 Critics have argued that if the detailed information reported to the database {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/exchanges-cite-hacking-risk-of-secs-planned-market-data-repository-1505508831"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 fell into the wrong hands}}}\uc2 , it could be used to reconstruct the most lucrative and closely guarded trades of hedge funds and other big investors. The very existence of a central repository of all trades will be an extremely juicy target for hackers, they say.\par \par \uc2 "Let's not line all of our battleships up in a row in Pearl Harbor and make our exposure much worse," Curt Bradbury, chief operating officer and director of financial-services firm \uc2 Stephens Inc\uc2 ., said in an emailed statement.\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. Clayton pledged to move ahead with the project, he said repeatedly Tuesday that regulators must be careful to collect only the data they need\u8212\'20\'14and only if they are able to protect it.\par \par \uc2 The remarks aren't what the brokerage industry had likely hoped for, but they do signal the SEC is listening to industry concerns about the system's potential vulnerabilities.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Departure of \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  Lawyer Is Focus of SEC Probe\par \par \uc2 By Andrew Ackerman, Joe Palazzolo and Jennifer Maloney\par \par \uc2 Federal securities regulators are investigating an allegation by \uc2 PepsiCo Inc\uc2 .'s former top lawyer that the company fired her in retaliation for the way she handled an internal probe into potential wrongdoing in Russia, according to people familiar with the matter and internal documents.\par \par \uc2 Maura Smith, who was PepsiCo's general counsel from May 2011 to June 2012, oversaw outside lawyers hired by the company to dig into business practices at \uc2 Wimm-Bill-Dann\uc2 , a big Russian maker of dairy products and juices that \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  spent about $5 billion to acquire in 2011, the documents show.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  is looking at allegations that Ms. Smith was ousted because her work on the probe rankled others at \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 , people familiar with the matter said. The inquiry is at an early stage and is focused on the circumstances of Ms. Smith's dismissal, the people said, and may not lead to any enforcement action.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  did not engage in any retaliatory conduct and any allegations to the contrary are untrue," the company said in a statement. "The company is cooperating with the SEC investigation." \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  said Ms. Smith's departure was not related to "any dispute or disagreement" over the internal investigation.\par \par \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  said it looked into allegations of misconduct at the Russian company believed to have taken place before it bought the firm. "As soon as \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  became aware of the conduct, it fully investigated and remediated the issues, none of which were material to \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 's financial statements," \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  announced Ms. Smith's departure in 2012, the company said she was resigning to pursue other opportunities. Her separation agreement, signed four months after her exit, entitled her to nearly $6 million in cash payments, regulatory filings show. The agreement prevents the company and Ms. Smith from disparaging one another.\par \par \uc2 Some people familiar with Ms. Smith's tenure at \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  described it as stormy and marked by conflicts with other executives. They said that Ms. Smith's employment had been in question for months leading up to her exit.\par \par \uc2 Others familiar with Ms. Smith's time at the firm said she was an experienced general counsel who quickly endeared herself to PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi. But executives turned on her as the Russia investigation wore on, they said. Before joining the Purchase, N.Y., company, Ms. Smith served as general counsel for eight years at \uc2 International Paper Co\uc2 . and for five years at \uc2 Owens Corning\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  has assembled a team of high-profile lawyers to represent the company in the SEC investigation. The team includes \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2 , who stepped down as the chairman of the SEC in January and is now a partner at \uc2 Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\uc2 . It also includes partners at \uc2 Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP\uc2 , known as \uc2 WilmerHale\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Smith, 61, now in private practice, was subpoenaed this year by the SEC and met with government lawyers as part of an agency investigation of whether employment contracts at major U.S. firms discouraged employees from reporting wrongdoing, according to a memo prepared by \uc2 WilmerHale\uc2  and the people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The memo, which was dated Aug. 31, and other documents were mistakenly sent by a \uc2 WilmerHale\uc2  attorney to a Wall Street Journal reporter as part of communication to other attorneys working on the matter. The memo said the SEC "now appears to be focused on allegations by Ms. Smith that she was retaliated against in violation of the SEC's whistleblower rules."\par \par \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  bought a majority stake in \uc2 Wimm-Bill-Dann\uc2  in February 2011 and took full control in September of that year.\par \par \uc2 In August 2011, a \uc2 Wimm-Bill-Dann\uc2  employee used a \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  tip line to report an allegation that senior managers at the Russian company concealed a $3 million shortfall in forecast quarterly financial results by shifting expenses and improperly capitalizing about 1,700 tons of skim milk, the documents show.\par \par \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 's regional staff began investigating, but the company's headquarters didn't learn of the matter for months, people familiar with the matter said. The tip raised concerns among \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 's auditors about whether \uc2 Wimm-Bill-Dann\uc2  results before the takeover needed to be restated, internal documents show. The auditors concluded no restatement was necessary, one person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Following the episode, \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  engaged law firm \uc2 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP\uc2  to "tip over every rock" at \uc2 Wimm-Bill-Dann\uc2 , one of the people said. The investigation unearthed evidence of theft, improper land deals and millions of dollars in questionable consulting contracts and gratuities, including a company-owned Audi A8 sedan that was provided to a regional governor of Russia to use for free, according to internal documents. These practices had started when \uc2 Wimm-Bill-Dann\uc2  was an independent company, and some had continued after the \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  takeover.\par \par \uc2 Gibson Dunn concluded that the car and the consulting contracts "likely constitute potential violations" of accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a law that bars U.S.-listed companies from paying bribes to foreign officials and requires firms to maintain strong internal controls. The investigation found no conclusive evidence of more serious violations of the law's antibribery provisions, according to the documents.\par \par \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  took measures to address the findings, including removing employees involved in alleged wrongdoing and updating \uc2 Wimm-Bill-Dann\uc2 's financial controls and business practices to conform with \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 's compliance program, the documents show.\par \par \uc2 While the investigation was ongoing, Ms. Smith asked lawyers at Gibson Dunn to help her prepare a detailed memo for the \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  board that would present the major findings, according to internal documents. One of those lawyers felt uncomfortable with the request, according to one of the documents mistakenly sent to the Journal that summarized a recent conversation with her. To the lawyer, it appeared that Ms. Smith wanted to "call out names of former and current employees and place blame," while protecting her own position at the company, according to the document.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Smith had prepared a memo with the help of Gibson Dunn, and a 33-page draft dated June 7, 2012, was among the documents mistakenly sent to the Journal. Among its assertions: \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  executives in Europe didn't do enough due diligence after the \uc2 Wimm-Bill-Dann\uc2  deal, and the company's system for escalating potential problems to headquarters had malfunctioned at times.\par \par \uc2 After the Gibson Dunn attorney reached out around that time to \uc2 Hugh Johnston\uc2 , PepsiCo's chief financial officer, about her concerns, Mr. Johnston told Ms. Smith to stop work on the memo, according to the people familiar with the matter and internal documents. It was never sent to the board, according to others familiar with the matter, and Ms. Smith's employment ended June 15, 2012.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers Criticize SEC Chairman Over Handling of Hack\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Dave Michaels\uc2  and Andrew Ackerman\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14U.S. senators, already facing distress calls from constituents over the \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . hack, criticized the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 's new leader for how the agency handled a 2016 breach of its cornerstone system for storing market-moving information.\par \par \uc2 "I was disturbed to learn that the SEC suffered a cyberbreach of its Edgar system in 2016, but did not notify the public, or even all of its commissioners, until it was discovered during your recent review," Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said at a hearing Tuesday. "It is critical that the SEC safeguards the data it collects and maintains."\par \par \uc2 Facing his first crisis as the SEC's chairman, Jay Claytonsuggested that his agency may have mishandled how it initially responded to the breach. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) was even more critical of Mr. Clayton, saying "it raises questions about why the SEC seems to have swept this under the rug."\par \par \uc2 "This breach took place under your predecessor, but the disclosure, or lack thereof, is all yours," Mr. Brown said. "How are Main Street investors expected to have confidence that the SEC can hold big companies accountable when the SEC is not forthcoming?"\par \par \uc2 The corporate-filing system that was breached, known as Edgar, is the SEC's cornerstone system for storing and disseminating earnings announcements and other news that often moves stock prices. Edgar stands for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System.\par \par \uc2 The SEC has invested tens of millions of dollars in recent years to upgrade Edgar, which was introduced in the early 1990s to equalize access to information between Wall Street and Main Street.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, a former Wall Street lawyer who kept a low profile in the private sector, faced a series of tough questions over the SEC's cybersecurity, including the agency's plans for a massive database that will keep track of billions of daily trades and orders in U.S. stock and option markets. The SEC's general counsel, Robert Stebbins, sat behind him at a hearing packed with lobbyists for exchanges and securities dealers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, a former partner at \uc2 Sullivan & Cromwell LLP\uc2 , took office calling for deregulatory measures to make it easier for companies to go public. A barrage of cyberattacks are likely to force him to articulate a strategy for how the commission and companies will keep up with sophisticated traders and hackers in the age of \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Companies should be providing sooner disclosure about intrusions that may affect shareholder investment decisions," Mr. Clayton said under questioning from Mr. Brown. "Across the landscape of our markets, there should be better disclosure as to the cyberrisks we face."\par \par \uc2 The SEC chairman disclosed the Edgar breach last week in a single paragraph within a five-page statement on the agency's approach to cybersecurity. Facing stern questions from Mr. Brown about the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  breach and whether shareholders were told soon enough after the company knew, Mr. Clayton said he decided to disclose the SEC's own breach as soon as he had enough information to accurately inform market participants and investors. He said the SEC has hired outside consultants to test the vulnerability of its systems.\par \par \uc2 "One of the worries in a situation like this is that when you make a disclosure, other people try to test and probe," Mr. Clayton said. "We are under constant attack from nefarious actors."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, who took over in May under the Trump administration, said the government needs more resources to gird against cyberattacks and must do more to defend its systems. The SEC late Monday announced the formation of a cyber unit within its enforcement division that will investigate a variety of schemes enabled by technology, including market manipulation and hackers' attempts to steal inside information.\par \par \uc2 Although the breach was reported in 2016 to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and the security gaps were patched, for months SEC commissioners and a former chief operating officer were unaware of the hack. Mr. Clayton said Tuesday that he couldn't "say for sure" when the breach occurred in 2016. He also said he didn't believe his predecessor, \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2 , knew about the incident.\par \par \uc2 "This matter involving our Edgar system concerns me deeply," Mr. Clayton said. "Rightfully, it will cause this committee and others to increase their focus on whether the commission's approach to cybersecurity appropriately addresses our cyberrisk profile."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton said an ongoing enforcement probe prevents him from revealing much about the cyber break-in. He did disclose that the investigation, which he learned about in August, spurred a second look at the breach.\par \par \uc2 "Our division of enforcement had an ongoing investigation," Mr. Clayton said in response to a question from \uc2 Sen. John Kennedy\uc2  (R., La.). "Information they gained in connection with that investigation caused them to question whether there was a data breach of our system."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton didn't reveal the type of information accessed by hackers in 2016 or what stocks were affected. He said SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker is probing the source of the hack, the type of information obtained and how the SEC responded internally to the breach.\par \par \uc2 The hackers exploited a vulnerability in a part of Edgar that allows companies to test the accuracy of data transmitted in new forms, Mr. Clayton said last week. On Tuesday, he said hackers targeted "a defect in a custom piece of software in our Edgar system."\par \par \uc2 "My understanding of this landscape is that, the more custom software, the more likely it is to be vulnerable," Mr. Clayton said.\par \par \uc2 Hackers didn't obtain any personal information belonging to investors or create "systemic risk" for the financial system, according to Mr. Clayton.\par \par \uc2 He said Tuesday that the SEC's own breach doesn't mean it should delay the launch of the Consolidated Audit Trail, the repository of orders and trades that is due to begin receiving data from exchanges in November. The system will include personal information on stockbrokers' customers, such as Social Security numbers and dates of birth.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think full timeout on the CAT makes sense," he said.

EFX 0.91% moved to take concrete action over its massive hack ahead of congressional hearings next week, announcing Tuesday that Chairman and Chief Executive \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  would step aside while leaving the door open to compensation clawbacks.\par \par \uc2 The credit-reporting company's board looked to show \uc2 Equifax\uc2  and its leadership were being held accountable for the breach, according to people familiar with the matter. \uc2 Equifax\uc2  on Sept. 7 disclosed that the cyberattack compromised vital personal information\u8212\'20\'14names, addresses, social security numbers and dates of birth\u8212\'20\'14of potentially 143 million Americans.\par \par \uc2 The attack led to a public and political outcry. It also called into question \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's overall security practices and when and whether it patched a publicly identified security vulnerability. That vulnerability was later identified as being exploited by the hackers to ransack \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's systems.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Mr. Smith said that he believed "it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward."\par \par \uc2 In acting before hearings, \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's board had in mind the experience of former Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive \uc2 John Stumpf\uc2 , the people familiar with the matter said. That executive appeared almost exactly a year earlier before two congressional committees to answer for his bank's sales-practices scandal.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf was grilled by legislators and repeatedly refused to say whether his position or compensation would be affected by the bank's problems. Both Mr. Stumpf and the bank were attacked during and after the hearings for what many perceived as a lack of accountability. Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired soon afterward.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Equifax\uc2  board was also mindful that there were already calls among some legislators for both Mr. Smith and directors to be taken to task, a person familiar with the matter said. Although \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's chief information and security officers retired a week after the hack was disclosed, those departures weren't viewed as significant enough, the person added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith, CEO since 2005, is being succeeded as chairman by current director, Mark Feidler, who will serve as nonexecutive chairman, Equifax's board said. It added that Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who was most recently Equifax's president for the Asia-Pacific region, has been appointed interim CEO.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Barros was one of a handful of senior executives that Mr. Smith had been grooming as a possible successor in recent years, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Mr. Feidler said, "The board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident. We are working intensely to support consumers and make the necessary changes to minimize the risk that something like this happens again.\par \par \uc2 "Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize." He added that the board has formed a special committee to focus on "the issues arising from the incident and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken."\par \par \uc2 This could include further action related to Mr. Smith. An agreement with the departing executive said that while he will retire as of Tuesday, "all decisions relating to the characterization" of his departure will be deferred until the board completes a review. The agreement also stated Mr. Smith won't receive an annual bonus opportunity for 2017 and that he "irrevocably" gives up any claims to such a payout.\par \par \uc2 The agreement is unusual due to its open-ended nature. That, in turn, leaves open the possibility of compensation clawbacks.\par \par \uc2 An Equifax spokesman said that certain of Mr. Smith's pay awards "are still outstanding," and the disposition of those awards will await the outcome of the investigation. He did say that no matter how Mr. Smith's departure was characterized the executive wouldn't receive $5.2 million in severance he could otherwise have been entitled to.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith's 2016 pay package totaled nearly $15 million, and he has made about $127 million in combined total compensation since he joined \uc2 Equifax\uc2  as CEO in 2005.\par \par \uc2 No matter how Mr. Smith's departure is ultimately characterized, he is likely to receive an estimated $18.4 million due him under \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's pension and retirement plan. The CEO also owns more than 285,000 \uc2 Equifax\uc2  shares, of which around 62,000 are restricted stock units that have yet to vest. Altogether these are worth more than $29 million at the stock's current market price.\par \par \uc2 In the wake of the \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  scandal, the bank's board clawed back around $69 million in equity compensation previously awarded or paid to Mr. Stumpf.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith's compensation is likely to be a topic of discussion at the upcoming congressional hearings. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said in a statement Tuesday, "It's not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith is expected still to attend the hearings next week, one before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the other with the Senate Banking Committee. Ironically, Mr. Stumpf's successor, Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan, is due before the Banking Committee the same day Mr. Smith is in the House.\par \par \uc2 Aside from hearings, \uc2 Equifax\uc2  faces other legal issues. The company is being investigated by regulators and faces a slew of legal action, including civil suits from the Massachusetts Attorney General and the City Attorney of San Francisco. The breach itself is being probed by the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman \uc2 Jay Clayton\uc2  appeared to indicate during his own congressional testimony Tuesday that his agency was investigating the sales of stock by three \uc2 Equifax\uc2  executives just days after the company had first spotted the breach.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  is also contending with investors who have shaved about $4.5 billion, or about a quarter, from its market value since the breach was announced. Analysts said that Mr. Smith's departure wasn't surprising given the extent of the hack and that the company had set the right tone for its dealings with Washington.\par \par \uc2 "Our view has been that the political pressure for Smith's departure was going to be overwhelming so that it would be better for the company to do this in advance of the hearings next week so it could get credit for the action rather than be perceived as bowing to congressional pressure," \uc2 Cowen Inc\uc2 .'s Washington research group wrote in a note Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith leaves \uc2 Equifax\uc2  12 years after taking over as CEO. During his tenure, \uc2 Equifax\uc2  expanded its data offerings and grew rapidly through acquisitions. The company's market value rose to a peak of nearly $18 billion from about $4 billion when he started. The hack upended all that.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Michael Rapoport and Yuka Hayashi contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Warren Hints She Will Seek Equifax Executive-Pay Clawback\par \par \uc2 Top Democrats demanded that \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2 , who is resigning as Equifax's CEO, appear before the Senate Banking Committee as scheduled next week, and pressed for further actions from company executives. "It's not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) says, hinting she would seek the clawback of pay from executives. She demanded that Mr. Smith, along with the new chairman and the new interim CEO of Equifax, testify before the Banking Committee scheduled for Oct. 4. Ms. Warren, a leading critic of the financial industry, had led lawmakers' successful push to get \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  to claw back top executives' compensation following its phony-accounts scandal. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), the committee's top Democrat, echoed Ms. Warren's sentiment. "\uc2 Equifax\uc2  executives cannot be allowed to wash their hands of this while millions of Americans are left to deal with the consequences," he said. Meanwhile, California Rep.

The loans, which are placed on a homeowner's tax bill alongside property taxes, have been packaged into a series of bond deals and sold to asset managers and pension funds.\par \par \uc2 The program relies on contractors such as plumbers and air-conditioning repairmen to broker loans. Homeowners typically find out about the program when their contractor mentions it to them, or they are paired with a contractor through a lender. \uc2 Renovate America\uc2 , for example, uses thousands of contractors to sell its financing.\par \par \uc2 The loan program has sparked controversy as homeowners have complained about lack of underwriting guidelines and misrepresentation of their loan terms, the Journal has reported.

The SEC said he also wrote reports containing a false disclaimer that he wasn't trading on the companies he covered.\par \par \uc2 Analysts are required to disclose when they own affected shares or intend to trade in the near future.

The scenario could force a wave of asset sales and deprive developers of cash to build new projects, leading to a further potential deterioration in their finances, credit analysts say.\par \par \uc2 How the real estate scenario plays out has major implications for China's economy, which investors watch closely for signs of the direction of global growth. The sector contributes to nearly one-third of China's overall growth, according to Moody's Investors Service.\par \par \uc2 The trends reflect in part Beijing's efforts in the past year to restrict home sales as it feared that an overheated market fueled by a surge of mortgage lending could burst and ripple across the economy. Now, worries are growing that the market may be slowing even more in parts of China than policy makers had hoped.\par \par \uc2 "This year's very strong sales in tier three cities is unlikely to be sustained," said Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Group . "For next year, they're going to enter a down cycle."\par \par \uc2 Developers also are likely to pay more dearly for debt after home prices slowed for three straight months this summer, save a few small cities. Last year, only about 25% of developers paid 6% or higher for their yuan bonds, according to Wind. This year the ratio is more than 33%. Credit analysts expect that to climb further.\par \par \uc2 Since many loans use property as collateral, declines in value could exacerbate any chain of defaults for yuan bonds, bank loans and China's informal, lightly-regulated lending sector, potentially infecting China's financial system.\par \par \uc2 "The wall of bonds is just one symptom of the whole problem," said Anne Stevenson-Yang, founder of J Capital Research.\par \par \uc2 Large developers such as \uc2 China Evergrande Group\uc2 , Sunac China Holdings and Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. prospered through China's property boom in recent years. But they also racked up debt to fund land purchases while monetary policy was looser and credit was cheaper. Five large developers hold nearly half the bonds and options coming due next year, according to \uc2 Moody's\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 However, as the economy continues to slow\u8212\'20\'14the government targets about 6.5% GDP grow this year\u8212\'20\'14some analysts wonder how vulnerable developers are.\par \par \uc2 The recent rules aimed at cooling the market are also constraining developers' ways of raising money. That, in turn, could discourage smaller ones from investing in new projects.\par \par \uc2 Regulations include property-buying controls in big Chinese cities, such as caps on new-home sales prices and higher down-payment ratios. Other rules limit yuan bond sales on mainland exchanges and ban private asset managers from engaging in certain types of debt financing for real estate. The likely result: slower home sales and a higher risk of defaults.\par \par \uc2 Smaller developers are particularly vulnerable because of their high debt loads, experts say. For example, the net debt of state-backed \uc2 Yunnan Metropolitan Real Estate Development Co\uc2 . is 57 times earnings before interest and taxes, according to research firm Granite Peak Advisory. The ratio is 37 times for Fuzhou-based commercial real-estate developer Tahoe Group Co., and more than 23 times for Shanghai-based Yango Group Co.\par \par \uc2 In comparison, the leverage for all mainland-listed developers is 6.4 times, and 4 times for all Chinese companies excluding financial institutions, according to Granite Peak Advisory.\par \par \uc2 Most developers have adequate liquidity if they can't refinance debt and must repay bonds in full with cash next year, \uc2 Moody's\uc2  says. But their ability to do so is weakening. Rated developers' cash was 1.6 times short-term debt coverage, compared with 2 times last year, S&P Global Ratings says.\par \par \uc2 Some moves are afoot to address the concerns. Evergrande pledged to cut its net debt ratio to 70% from 270% by 2020 after reporting a ninefold jump in half-year earnings. In central Hubei province, a state-assets regulator ordered state-owned enterprises to speed up construction and sales to quickly book the revenue and lower financial leverage.\par \par \uc2 Despite the risks to China's real-estate market, global investors have continued to pile into dollar-denominated bonds of Chinese developers. Those developers issued $58 billion offshore over the year through late August, the highest volume for the period since 2014, according to Dealogic.\par \par \uc2 Other investors however are avoiding the market altogether, concerned they aren't getting paid enough for the risk.\par \par \uc2 "Coupons have to be much higher than where we are now," said Jennifer James, head of corporate research for emerging market credit at Janus Henderson Investors, which holds the offshore debt of one Chinese developer.

"In a world with homogeneous and rational expectations, home values should adjust smoothly to incorporate the present value of future flood risk increases due to sea level rise," researchers Laura Bakkensen and Lint Barrage write.

Several other agencies, including the Justice Department, the \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2  and the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2 , also deal with market-moving information and enforcement actions, but some haven't received sufficient funding from Congress to address security risks, she writes.

Cardinal Partners is taking things a step further.\par \par \uc2 The firm joined with Stanford researchers to launch Cardinal Analytx Inc. The startup, which just closed a $6.1 million Series A round led by Cardinal Partners, has developed an \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  platform that uses AI to predict future health-care costs.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the obvious cases, predicting who will be high-cost patients isn't always a clear-cut exercise. But doing so could potentially yield cost savings across the health-care system.\par \par \uc2 Co-founders Dr. Nigam Shah and Dr. Arnold Milstein developed algorithms to identify people who may currently be considered average-cost patients, but could quickly become some of the most expensive.\par \par \uc2 "This is finding a new population that other \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools missed because they were only looking at claims data, when it's too late," said Cardinal Analytx interim Chief Executive Thomas McKinley.\par \par \uc2 The company ran a study of 1.4 million \uc2 Premera Blue Cross\uc2  members and identified almost 70% more future high-cost patients than those noticed by existing \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools.\par \par \uc2 Those results led \uc2 Premera Blue Cross\uc2  to invest in the Series A as a strategic partner.\par \par \uc2 Over the next year, Cardinal will work to secure customers in large health insurance plans and physician networks. Additionally, the company will use the funding to hire more data scientists and engineers.\par \par \uc2 At a time of heightened debate about the future of health-care policy, new tools that can drive down costs that otherwise wouldn't be on an insurer's radar is worth trying, said Cardinal Analytx Chairman John Clarke.\par \par \uc2 "Our whole goal," he said, "regardless of which way the national health care delivery services and reimbursement models evolve, is to deliver more care for less money."\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Mack at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Heather.Mack@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heather.Mack@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170927ed9r0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- U.S. senators, already facing distress calls from constituents over the \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . hack, criticized the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 's new leader for how the agency handled a 2016 breach of its cornerstone system for storing market-moving information.\par \par \uc2 "I was disturbed to learn that the \uc2 SEC\uc2  suffered a cyberbreach of its Edgar system in 2016, but did not notify the public, or even all of its commissioners, until it was discovered during your recent review," \uc2 Sen. Mike Crapo\uc2  (R., Idaho), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said at a hearing Tuesday. "It is critical that the \uc2 SEC\uc2  safeguards the data it collects and maintains."\par \par \uc2 Facing his first crisis as the SEC's chairman, \uc2 Jay Clayton\uc2  suggested that his agency may have mishandled how it initially responded to the breach. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) was even more critical of Mr. Clayton, saying "it raises questions about why the \uc2 SEC\uc2  seems to have swept this under the rug."\par \par \uc2 "This breach took place under your predecessor, but the disclosure, or lack thereof, is all yours," Mr. Brown said. "How are Main Street investors expected to have confidence that the \uc2 SEC\uc2  can hold big companies accountable when the \uc2 SEC\uc2  is not forthcoming?"\par \par \uc2 The corporate-filing system that was breached, known as Edgar, is the \uc2 SEC\uc2 's cornerstone system for storing and disseminating earnings announcements and other news that often moves stock prices. Edgar stands for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2  has invested tens of millions of dollars in recent years to upgrade Edgar, which was introduced in the early 1990s to equalize access to information between Wall Street and Main Street.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton faced a series of tough questions over the \uc2 SEC\uc2 's cybersecurity, including the agency's plans for a massive database that will keep track of billions of daily trades and orders in U.S. stock and option markets. The SEC's general counsel, Robert Stebbins, sat behind him at a hearing packed with lobbyists for exchanges and securities dealers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, a former partner at law firm \uc2 Sullivan & Cromwell LLP\uc2 , took office calling for deregulatory measures to make it easier for companies to go public. A barrage of cyberattacks are likely to force him to articulate a strategy for how the commission and companies will keep up with sophisticated traders and hackers in the age of \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Companies should be providing sooner disclosure about intrusions that may affect shareholder investment decisions," Mr. Clayton said under questioning from Mr. Brown. "Across the landscape of our markets, there should be better disclosure as to the cyberrisks we face."\par \par \uc2 The SEC chairman disclosed the Edgar breach last week in a single paragraph within a five-page statement on the agency's approach to cybersecurity. Facing stern questions from Mr. Brown about the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  breach and whether shareholders were told soon enough after the company knew, Mr. Clayton said he decided to disclose the \uc2 SEC\uc2 's own breach as soon as he had enough information to accurately inform market participants and investors. He said the \uc2 SEC\uc2  has hired outside consultants to test the vulnerability of its systems.\par \par \uc2 "One of the worries in a situation like this is that when you make a disclosure, other people try to test and probe," Mr. Clayton said. "We are under constant attack from nefarious actors."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, who took over in May under the Trump administration, said the government needs more resources to gird against cyberattacks and must do more to defend its systems. The \uc2 SEC\uc2  late Monday announced the formation of a cyber unit within its enforcement division that will investigate a variety of schemes enabled by technology, including market manipulation and hackers' attempts to steal inside information.\par \par \uc2 Although the breach was reported in 2016 to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and the security gaps were patched, for months \uc2 SEC\uc2  commissioners and a former chief operating officer were unaware of the hack. Mr. Clayton said Tuesday that he couldn't "say for sure" when the breach occurred in 2016. He also said he didn't believe his predecessor, \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2 , knew about the incident.\par \par \uc2 "This matter involving our Edgar system concerns me deeply," Mr. Clayton said. "Rightfully, it will cause this committee and others to increase their focus on whether the commission's approach to cybersecurity appropriately addresses our cyberrisk profile."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton said a continuing enforcement probe prevents him from revealing much about the cyber break-in. He did disclose that the investigation, which he learned about in August, spurred a second look at the breach.\par \par \uc2 "Our division of enforcement had an ongoing investigation," Mr. Clayton said in response to a question from \uc2 Sen. John Kennedy\uc2  (R., La.). "Information they gained in connection with that investigation caused them to question whether there was a data breach of our system."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton didn't reveal the type of information accessed by hackers in 2016 or what stocks were affected. He said SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker is probing the source of the hack, the type of information obtained and how the \uc2 SEC\uc2  responded internally.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170927000081"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170927ed9r00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . moved to take concrete action over its far-reaching hack ahead of congressional hearings next week, announcing that Chairman and Chief Executive \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  would step aside while leaving the door open to clawbacks of compensation.\par \par \uc2 The credit-reporting company's board looked to show that \uc2 Equifax\uc2  and its leadership were being held accountable for the breach, according to people familiar with the matter. \uc2 Equifax\uc2  on Sept. 7 disclosed that the cyberattack compromised vital personal information -- names, addresses, social security numbers and dates of birth -- of potentially 143 million Americans.\par \par \uc2 The attack led to a public and political outcry. It also called into question \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's overall security practices and when and whether it patched a publicly identified security vulnerability. That vulnerability was later identified as being exploited by the hackers to ransack \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's systems.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Mr. Smith said that he believed "it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward."\par \par \uc2 In acting before hearings, \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's board had in mind the experience of former Wells Fargo CEO \uc2 John Stumpf\uc2 , the people familiar with the matter said. That executive appeared almost exactly a year earlier before two congressional committees to answer for his bank's sales-practices scandal.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf was grilled by legislators and repeatedly refused to say whether his position or compensation would be affected by the bank's problems. Both Mr. Stumpf and the bank were attacked during and after the hearings for what many perceived as a lack of accountability. Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired soon afterward.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Equifax\uc2  board was also mindful that there were calls among some legislators for both Mr. Smith and directors to be taken to task, a person familiar with the matter said. Although \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's chief information and security officers retired a week after the hack was disclosed, those departures weren't viewed as significant enough, the person added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith, CEO since 2005, is being succeeded as chairman by a current director, Mark Feidler, who will serve as nonexecutive chairman, Equifax's board said. It added that Paulino do Rego Barros, Jr., who was most recently Equifax's president for the Asia-Pacific region, has been appointed interim CEO.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Mr. Feidler said, "The board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident. We are working intensely to support consumers and make the necessary changes to minimize the risk that something like this happens again.\par \par \uc2 "Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologize." He added that the board has formed a special committee to focus on "the issues arising from the incident and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken."\par \par \uc2 This could include further action related to Mr. Smith. An agreement with the departing executive said that while he would retire as of Tuesday, "all decisions relating to the characterization" of his departure will be deferred until the board completes a review. The agreement also stated Mr. Smith won't receive an annual bonus opportunity for 2017 and that he "irrevocably" gives up any claims to such a payout.\par \par \uc2 The agreement is unusual due to its open-ended nature. That, in turn, leaves open the possibility of compensation clawbacks.\par \par \uc2 An Equifax spokesman said that certain of Mr. Smith's pay awards "are still outstanding," and the disposition of those awards will await the outcome of the investigation. He did say that no matter how Mr. Smith's departure was characterized the executive wouldn't receive $5.2 million in severance he could otherwise have been entitled to.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith's 2016 pay package totaled nearly $15 million, and he has made about $127 million in combined total compensation since he joined \uc2 Equifax\uc2  as CEO in 2005.\par \par \uc2 No matter how Mr. Smith's departure is ultimately characterized, he is likely to receive an estimated $18.4 million due him under \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's pension and retirement plan.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith's compensation is likely to be a topic of discussion at the coming hearings. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D. Mass.) said in a statement Tuesday, "It's not real accountability if the CEO resigns without giving back a nickel in pay and without publicly answering questions."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith is expected to attend the hearings next week, one before the House Energy Committee, the other with the Senate Banking Committee.\par \par \uc2 Aside from hearings, \uc2 Equifax\uc2  faces other legal issues. The company is being investigated by regulators and faces legal action, including civil suits from the Massachusetts Attorney General and the City Attorney of San Francisco. The breach itself is being probed by the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  is also contending with investors who have shaved about $4.5 billion, or about a quarter, from its market value since the breach was announced.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170927000075"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170927ed9r00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Under pressure to convey populist anger about Wall Street bailouts, he offered a glib admonition towards the banking sector: \u8220\'20\'1CYou can\u8217\'20\'19t go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer\u8217\'20\'19s dime.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For America\u8217\'20\'19s biggest gaming empire, \uc2 Harrah\u8217\'20\'19s Entertainment\uc2 , the rebuke could not have come at a worse time. A year earlier, Harrah\u8217\'20\'19s had been taken over in a bold $31bn leveraged buyout by Apollo Global Management and TPG, two private equity pioneers. They paid a 31 per cent premium for the later renamed \uc2 Caesars Entertainment\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 honouring its best-known property, Las Vegas\u8217\'20\'19 Caesars Palace. The high price reflected the belief that casinos had stood resilient in earlier recessions.\par \par \uc2 But by 2015, Caesars filed for bankruptcy protection , weighed down by $24bn of debt. Convention business, the lifeblood of Las Vegas, dried up as the financial sector steered clear of Nevada. Casino owners never forgot Mr Obama\u8217\'20\'19s dig and partially blamed their subsequent financial woes on it.\par \par \uc2 The Caesars bankruptcy has been one of the nastiest corporate brawls in recent memory. Caesars debtholders \u8212\'20\'14 led by \uc2 Elliott Management\uc2 , Appaloosa Management and Oaktree Capital \u8212\'20\'14 accused the private equity firms of \u8220\'20\'1Cunimaginably brazen looting\u8221\'20\'1D in the years after the 2008 buyout.\par \par \uc2 The creditors, described by one member of the buyout group as the \u8220\'20\'1Csmartest debt investors in the world\u8221\'20\'1D, alleged that the private equity owners had methodically siphoned Caesars\u8217\'20\'19 crown jewel properties to other entities they owned to salvage what ever value remained for themselves. Apollo and TPG insisted that they had battled to keep Caesars alive so it could fight another day.\par \par \uc2 The allegations of impropriety gained enough legal traction that Apollo\u8217\'20\'19s co-founder \uc2 Marc Rowan\uc2  and TPG co-founder \uc2 David Bonderman\uc2  were ordered by a court last year to produce personal financial documents showing their ability to meet billions of dollars of potential personal judgments against them. Jim Millstein, the company\u8217\'20\'19s banker, said in a 2015 court hearing that the fight could degenerate into \u8220\'20\'1Cone of the great messes of our time\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 But while the Masters of the Universe were busy swapping accusations, Las Vegas quietly recovered. With a former casino owner now occupying the White House, finance and tech gatherings regularly roll into town, attracting thousands who want to eat, party, gamble, take in a show and forget the real world.\par \par \uc2 Caesars\u8217\'20\'19 players\par \par \uc2 Apollo\par \par \uc2 Marc Rowan\par \par \uc2 Apollo co-founder with other former Drexel Burnham Lambert executives.

Like Loveman and Rowan, he was seen as liable for the asset sales.

But, for all the wrangling and lawsuits, the fortuitous outcome is a result of the less flashy work of repairing an underlying business.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe casino business has this mathematical beauty to it. But nobody was using it,\u8221\'20\'1D explained Gary Loveman, who went from a Harvard Business School professor who consulted for Caesars in the 1990s to being the company\u8217\'20\'19s chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Mr Loveman\u8217\'20\'19s insights from collecting the gambling, dining and lodging habits of Caesars customers led to the creation of a loyalty programme called Total Rewards. Gamblers could rack up points by betting at Caesars\u8217\'20\'19 small-time casinos in Illinois or Mississippi, then use those points at glitzier resorts in Las Vegas or Atlantic City.\par \par \uc2 His \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  initiative was a smash. By 2007, Caesars, which had started out 70 years earlier as a single bingo hall in Reno, Nevada, had accumulated more than 50 properties in the US. Annual group revenue exceeded $12bn.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, the chain attracted the interest of Apollo and TPG, which were involved in the push by private equity firms to do once inconceivable leveraged buyouts of large, listed companies. At $31bn, Caesars ranks as the seventh-biggest LBO in American history.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe thought we had the ability to use more leverage than public companies were comfortable with so the overall cost of capital was lower. In retrospect, this [arbitrage] should not be what PE is all about,\u8221\'20\'1D says an executive at one prominent financial investor, explaining the 2004-08 LBO binge.\par \par \uc2 Led by Apollo and TPG, the equity investors would contribute $6bn of equity towards Caesars. Smaller members of the group included the industrialist James Packer, \uc2 Robert Kraft\uc2 , the owner of the \uc2 New England Patriots\uc2 , and even Steven Mnuchin, now the US Treasury secretary.\par \par \uc2 Apollo and TPG have consistently denied any charges of wrongdoing, maintaining they acted consistent with their duties. The creditor groups declined to comment for this story.\par \par \uc2 The deal\u8217\'20\'19s closing in 2008 was just in time for the onset of the financial crisis. The collapse of tourism and conventions contributed to annual revenue falling at Caesars by a fifth between 2007 and 2009. The company faced nearly $2bn in annual interest payments, which alone exceeded its cash generation. With Apollo effectively calling the shots, Caesars tried different tactics which led to the subsequent legal free-for-all.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CApollo founders are famously difficult people,\u8221\'20\'1D says one long-time executive who had worked closely with Apollo for years, referring to \uc2 Leon Black\uc2 , \uc2 Joshua Harris\uc2 , \uc2 Marc Rowan\uc2  and others who met at \uc2 Michael Milken\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank in the 1980s. \u8220\'20\'1CTheir duty is to the equity and they will do anything legally they can do to defend that equity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Between 2011 and 2014, Caesars \u8212\'20\'14 at the behest of Apollo \u8212\'20\'14 began selling off portions of its intellectual property and Las Vegas properties including \uc2 Planet Hollywood\uc2 , \uc2 Bally\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s, Linq/Octavius, the Quad and the Cromwell. The buyers of all those assets: none other than entities controlled by Apollo and TPG.\par \par \uc2 For Caesars\u8217\'20\'19 private equity owners, the billions in proceeds kept Caesars afloat. While Mr Rowan was the most senior Apollo executive involved at Caesars, the day-to-day management was left to a young Apollo investor, \uc2 David Sambur\uc2 , who had joined the firm in 2004 in his mid-20s. While considered analytically brilliant, his bare-knuckle negotiating tactics wore thin on others.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSambur is one of the most difficult human beings I have ever dealt with,\u8221\'20\'1D says one veteran restructuring specialist about the Apollo executive\u8217\'20\'19s negotiating tactics over Caesars. \u8220\'20\'1CHe was like the cat with the cheese. He would make an offer one day and retract it the next.\u8221\'20\'1D One creditor said that it was not uncommon for Mr Sambur to storm out of negotiating sessions, leaving the others in the room confused about the status of the talks.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Saferstein, a lawyer at Paul Weiss who represented the parent Caesars company controlled by Apollo and TPG and who is the longtime outside counsel to Apollo, responded: \u8220\'20\'1CI have been a restructuring and bankruptcy lawyer for 28 years and I do not believe \uc2 David Sambur\uc2  was more difficult in the Caesars case than anyone else nor in any other transaction I have worked on. David was completely fair and responsible.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Creditors of the primary Caesars operating company saw the parade of asset sales not as life-saving manoeuvres but as craven asset stripping: a \u8220\'20\'1CGood Caesars\u8221\'20\'1D had been created that seized the best properties on behalf of Apollo and TPG, leaving the loan and bondholders the weakest assets that could not satisfy debts.\par \par \uc2 Did Caesars sell off assets on the cheap?\par \par \uc2 Planet\par \par \uc2 Hollywood\par \par \uc2 $515m\par \par \uc2 Shortfall in valuation of the Las Vegas \uc2 Planet Hollywood\uc2 /Baltimore JV sold in October 2013\par \par \uc2 Linq/\par \par \uc2 Octavius\par \par \uc2 $249m\par \par \uc2 Shortfall in valuation for the Linq and Octavius buildings in Las Vegas sold in October 2013\par \par \uc2 The Cromwell and other assets\par \par \uc2 $850m\par \par \uc2 Shortfall in valuation for The Cromwell, \uc2 Bally\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s, Quad and \uc2 Harrah\u8217\'20\'19s New Orleans\uc2  sold in May 2014\par \par \uc2 Source for valuation shortfalls: Examiner\u8217\'20\'19s report, March 2016\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Lawsuits began in 2014 over the asset sales and accompanying terminations of bond guarantees made by the Caesars parent company. In early 2015, Caesars filed for Chapter 11 protection in Illinois, where it had casinos.\par \par \uc2 That meant that Caesars was fighting a creditor war on two fronts: on the one hand, it was contesting the spiralling litigation in multiple venues and, on the other, working to strike a consensual restructuring to take advantage of the recovering Las Vegas. By 2016, Caesars had rallied support with debtholders that represented $14bn of the operating company\u8217\'20\'19s $18bn in debt.\par \par \uc2 The key remaining adversaries: David Tepper\u8217\'20\'19s Appaloosa and \uc2 Howard Marks\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 Oaktree, formidable hedge funds that had accumulated stakes in Caesars\u8217\'20\'19 junior \u8220\'20\'1Csecond-lien bonds\u8221\'20\'1D and had clashed before with Apollo at other companies.\par \par \uc2 Caesars\u8217\'20\'19 initial offer to this group in 2015 was a recovery of 9 cents on the dollar, each cent representing roughly $50m. In American law, the concept of \u8220\'20\'1Ccramdown\u8221\'20\'1D allows a bankruptcy judge to overrule holdout creditors blocking an otherwise reasonable deal.\par \par \uc2 But Apollo\u8217\'20\'19s plan to isolate and cram down the junior bondholder group flopped. Richard Davis, a former Watergate counsel and federal prosecutor, had been appointed as an independent examiner to investigate the claims of fraudulent asset sales at Caesars after its LBO. Mr Davis concluded in 2016 that there was significant evidence of as much as $5bn worth of fraudulent transfers executed by Caesars\u8217\'20\'19 management and board. Liability for these transfers flowed up as far as board members including Mr Loveman, Mr Bonderman and Mr Rowan.\par \par \uc2 While the fraud lawsuits were automatically paused because of the bankruptcy proceedings, the separate lawsuits against the parent Caesars company over bond guarantee terminations continued with more than $10bn in possible liability. Apollo had been successful in getting Benjamin Goldgar, the Illinois bankruptcy judge, to pause those trials in order to let the parties strike a restructuring deal.\par \par \uc2 By late summer, Judge Goldgar lost his patience with the private equity firms and allowed the bond guarantee trials to proceed. He noted that the offer on the table from Apollo and TPG allowed the two to contribute virtually no money of their own to the new Caesars while getting complete releases in liability from fraud and other wrongdoing claims.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CParticularly disturbing is that [neither TPG nor Apollo] is making any financial contribution to the reorganisation although the proposed plan would release all claims against them,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 In September, he ordered Mr Loveman, Mr Bonderman and Mr Rowan to begin providing personal financial statements. The ownership group capitulated last autumn. The parent Caesars entity controlled by the equity sponsor group agreed to put $6bn into the restructured company, including handing back most of their equity ownership in Caesars to the overall creditor group.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMaybe they could have gotten away with two or three of these asset sales,\u8221\'20\'1D says one creditor. \u8220\'20\'1CBut if you rob a bank nine times, on the tenth time the cops will probably show up.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The initial 9 cents on the dollar offer to the junior bond group was increased to 66 cents, comprised of cash and a stake in the new Caesars. That debt has now traded up to above 90 cents. The Caesars stock that trades publicly has almost doubled this year. Both securities demonstrate the enthusiasm for the sleeker Caesars in a revitalised Las Vegas. The sliver of equity, just under 20 per cent, which Apollo and TPG were allowed to keep is worth nearly $2bn.\par \par \uc2 TPG\u8217\'20\'19s Caesars headache has been replaced by another at Uber. Mr Bonderman was forced to resign from the board after an insensitive remark to fellow director, Arianna Huffington.\par \par \uc2 Times are better for Apollo, which this year raised a $25bn buyout fund, the largest in history. Its shares are the best performing among listed US private equity firms in the past two years. Several rivals are increasingly willing to replicate its hardball tactics in their own creditor negotiations.\par \par \uc2 By 2016, most of the key indicators of Las Vegas tourism, such as visitors and rooms occupied, were ahead of their pre-crisis peaks. But now, gambling accounts for less than half of casino revenue with tourists and convention goers clamouring for entertainment and high-end dining. Britney Spears first and now Jennifer Lopez have had successful residencies at Caesars properties; chefs including Gordon Ramsay, Nobu and Mr Chow have franchises.\par \par \uc2 Since the January 2015 bankruptcy filing, the company has not made any interest payments and has ploughed that cash into refreshing its properties, with virtually all of its 25,000 rooms set to be renovated by 2020.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the biggest sign of the city\u8217\'20\'19s revival came from the Obama administration itself. In May, the annual hedge fund conference put on in the city by \uc2 Anthony Scaramucci\uc2 , the Wall Street provocateur and shortlived White House official, was full of investors giddy about the presidency of \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , the erstwhile casino tycoon. Giving a keynote speech was none other than \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , Mr Obama\u8217\'20\'19s vice-president.\par \par \uc2 This article was amended on September 27 to include a response from Apollo.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Private equity remains \u8216\'20\'18golden goose\u8217\'20\'19 for bankers\par \par \uc2 The bankruptcy of \uc2 Caesars Entertainment\uc2  was billed as a fight waged between private equity and hedge funds. But investment banks and law firms took a central role as well. An investigation by an independent examiner concluded that there may have been as much as $5.1bn in fraudulent transfer claims from controversial asset sales that Caesars undertook between 2009 and 2014 before its bankruptcy filing.\par \par \uc2 Those transactions faced scrutiny because the investigation first determined that the key subsidiary holding Caesars debt was insolvent and should have had directors and advisers independent of \uc2 Apollo Global\uc2  and TPG, the private equity firms that owned the Caesars parent company.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street law firm Paul Weiss, one of whose largest clients is Apollo, has faced criticism for both not warning Caesars about the risks of insolvency and then representing both sides of Caesars in related party transactions. The investigator determined that while any legal claims against the firm were weak, Paul Weiss displayed a meaningful conflict of interest. The firm denies any wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 Three boutique investment banks \u8212\'20\'14 Perella Weinberg, Evercore and \uc2 Centerview Partners\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 provided \u8220\'20\'1Cfairness opinions\u8221\'20\'1D (a professional evaluation of a deal\u8217\'20\'19s terms by a third party) in three large, challenged asset sales. All three transactions include allegations of the banker\u8217\'20\'19s analysis relying on flawed or incomplete financial assumptions. Evercore, for example, did not include the positive impact of Britney Spears\u8217\'20\'19 new residency at Caesars\u8217\'20\'19 \uc2 Planet Hollywood\uc2  property in Las Vegas. The examiner\u8217\'20\'19s report showed various degrees of resistance by the banks against the private equity firms, which appeared to have tried to steer the results of the opinions. All three still issued fairness opinions and collected millions in fees. The potential legal liability in those transactions added up to $3bn. The three banks declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 In a filing, Apollo and TPG wrote: \u8220\'20\'1CThe independence and expertise of these legal and financial advisers likewise cannot be questioned.\u8221\'20\'1D But private equity firms and their portfolio companies represent large fee opportunities with their serial financings and acquisitions. One hedge fund investor wondered, then, if the advice of bankers was intrinsically tainted. \u8220\'20\'1CPrivate equity firms cut a wide swath,\u8221\'20\'1D the investor said. \u8220\'20\'1CYou do not want to cross them and risk the golden goose.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170926ed9q009su\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to say Tuesday that his agency may have mishandled a breach of its system for disclosing market-moving news and promise to intensify how it defends itself against hackers.\par \par \uc2 Facing his first crisis as the SEC's chairman, \uc2 Jay Clayton\uc2  suggested in testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday that not enough was done under his predecessor, former chairman \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2 , to size up a 2016 breach that might have provided the basis for insider trading.\par \par \uc2 Ms. White, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2 's handling of the hack -- which was disclosed in an unusual and lengthy evening statement last Wednesday -- is likely to generate tough questions from senators who already face distress calls from constituents over the hacker attack on \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 ., from which intruders ransacked vast troves of personal information, including social security numbers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, who took over in May under the Trump administration, is expected to say that the regulator must do more to defend against cyberattacks, according to prepared testimony. The \uc2 SEC\uc2  late Monday announced the formation of a cyber unit within its enforcement division that will investigate a variety of schemes enabled by technology, including market manipulation and hackers' attempts to steal inside information.\par \par \uc2 Although the breach was reported in 2016 to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and the security gaps were patched, for months \uc2 SEC\uc2  commissioners and a former chief operating officer were unaware of the 2016 hack.\par \par \uc2 The corporate-filing system that was breached, known as Edgar, is the \uc2 SEC\uc2 's cornerstone system for storing and disseminating earnings announcements and other news that often moves stock prices.\par \par \uc2 "This matter involving our Edgar system concerns me deeply," said Mr. Clayton's prepared testimony, released Monday by the Senate Banking Committee. "Rightfully, it will cause this committee and others to increase their focus on whether the commission's approach to cybersecurity appropriately addresses our cyberrisk profile."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton's testimony says an ongoing enforcement probe prevents him from revealing much about the cyber break-in. He did disclose that the investigation, which he learned about in August, spurred a second look at the breach.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton first disclosed the hack last week in a five-page statement in which he spelled out his approach to cybersecurity, an issue that is fast becoming an Achilles' heel of the financial industry. In addition to \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , accounting firm Deloitte said on Monday that it suffered a cyberattack in which an intruder accessed data affecting a "very few" of Deloitte's clients.\par \par \uc2 Democratic senators are expected to question whether Mr. Clayton's statement last week went far enough to inform investors and other \uc2 SEC\uc2  watchers about the scope of the hack, leaving corporate finance chiefs to wonder whether it was their firm's confidential information that was compromised.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton's planned Senate comments don't reveal the type of information accessed by hackers in 2016 or what stocks were affected. His statement says SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker is probing the source of the hack, the type of information obtained, and how the \uc2 SEC\uc2  responded internally to the breach.\par \par \uc2 The hackers exploited a vulnerability in a part of Edgar that allows companies to test the accuracy of data transmitted in new forms, Mr. Clayton said last week.\par \par \uc2 Hackers didn't obtain any personal information belonging to investors or create "systemic risk" for the financial system, according to Mr. Clayton's Senate testimony.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hoecker's office is separately scheduled to issue an audit in coming weeks after digging into the \uc2 SEC\uc2 's history of attempts to upgrade and improve the decades-old Edgar system. The \uc2 SEC\uc2  has spent about $69 million since 2013 on Edgar upgrades, according to reports provided to Congress. The \uc2 SEC\uc2  funded the projects with a special $50 million annual technology fund that the White House has since proposed eliminating.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2  has for years been on notice about problems with the Edgar system. In 2014, for instance, academic researchers found that hedge funds and other rapid-fire investors got earlier access to market-moving documents from Edgar than other users of the standard, web-based system, an issue that the \uc2 SEC\uc2  later said it fixed. In 2015, a Bulgarian man filed a fake takeover offer for \uc2 Avon Products Inc\uc2 ., which succeeded in sending the company's shares soaring.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2 's response to the 2016 hack is likely to drive questions on Tuesday about whether it can safeguard a vast database of trades that it points to as a way to probe market manipulation.\par \par \uc2 The Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT, is due to begin receiving data from stock exchanges in November following a multiyear push by the \uc2 SEC\uc2  to finish the plan. It would keep track of every trade and order in U.S. stock and option markets and will include personal information on stockbrokers' customers, such as social security numbers and dates of birth.\par \par \uc2 An array of market participants and industry groups have said it is likely to become a major target of hackers seeking to steal trading data and identity thieves.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton entered office calling for deregulatory measures to make it easier for companies to go public. But a barrage of cyberattacks are likely to force him to articulate a strategy for keeping up with market participants and cybercriminals in the age of \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said Andy Green, a former Senate aide and SEC lawyer.\par \par \uc2 A bipartisan group of 19 banking committee lawmakers on Monday urged Mr. Clayton to consider updating the \uc2 SEC\uc2 's six-year-old guidelines for how companies disclose hacks. The senators urged Mr. Clayton to consider whether new regulations are needed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton has said in previous speeches that more coordination among government agencies was essential to defend against a sophisticated array of hackers.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Andrew Ackerman contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170926ed9q0001v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

GV, the company's venture arm, also joined the Series C round, which was led by \uc2 Norwest Venture Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Designed in the \uc2 Google\uc2  mold and featuring direct integration with apps like Gmail, Calendar and Sheets, ProsperWorks functions like another \uc2 Google\uc2  product. The company counts some 25,000 customers. Chief Executive and co-founder Jon Lee said the company tripled its revenue in 2016.\par \par \uc2 To keep up with that growth, ProsperWorks has significantly expanded its workforce in the past year, going from around 90 employees in 2016 to 140 today. Mr. Lee said those numbers should keep growing, as the company hires more engineers and builds out third party integration platforms to accommodate larger enterprise clients.\par \par \uc2 "We're kind of like David, with backing from Goliath," said Mr. Jon Lee. "We started out automatically syncing with the best sources, and as we move forward, our broader vision is to use AI to recommend and assist the user and really change the notion of what this software can do for you."\par \par \uc2 ProsperWorks isn't the only startup working to siphon off some of \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 's massive customer base. \uc2 SugarCRM Inc\uc2  and \uc2 Nimble Inc\uc2 . also offer CRM alternatives, while others like Guru Technologies Inc. have developed platforms that offer automated assistance to users by pulling together commonly used apps including Gmail, Slack and \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Lee said ProsperWorks is different in that it started from a native app exchange with \uc2 Google\uc2  so nothing felt like an add-on. Now, with an established customer base and around $87 million in total funding to date, the company will explore third-party app integration and invest deeper in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  categories.\par \par \uc2 "CRM is used around the world. \uc2 Google\uc2  is everywhere. There are a lot of international expansion opportunities," said Norwest Senior Managing Partner \uc2 Promod Haque\uc2 , who led the investment and will take a board position at ProsperWorks. "They aren't limited to \uc2 Google\uc2 , but as the G Suite moves upstream to larger and larger customers, the market opportunity will be huge."\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Mack at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Heather.Mack@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heather.Mack@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170926ed9q000b5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The SEC hadn't previously specified that it looked into the hack because of a probe into possible illegal trading.\par \par \uc2 However, SEC officials so far haven't provided information about the filings in question, nor have they said which companies might have been affected by the breach.\par \par \uc2 It remains unclear why the SEC waited until last Wednesday evening to publicly disclose the hack\u8212\'20\'14which Mr. Clayton learned about in August\u8212\'20\'14or why the disclosure of the incident was buried in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-09-20"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 long statement}}}\uc2  on cybersecurity issues.\par \par \uc2 Also unanswered is why the SEC didn't inform its senior officials of the hack earlier. Mr. Clayton's two colleagues on the commission, Michael Piwowar and Kara Stein, both found out about the security breach only recently, The Wall Street Journal {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-sec-officials-only-recently-learned-of-2016-company-database-hack-1506017614"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reported last week}}}\uc2 . At least one former senior staffer said he knew nothing about the hack.\par \par \uc2 To his credit, Mr. Clayton does imply that the SEC's internal system for notifying its own personnel about hacks was lacking. He is expected to tell lawmakers he has asked staff to "enhance" the commission's "escalation protocols" for future cybersecurity incidents, according to the written testimony.\par \par \uc2 Still, the SEC's response has come under much criticism. Public companies typically require their boards of directors to oversee cybersecurity issues, while the SEC appears to have diverted from this practice. The most senior levels of the SEC seem to have been informed about the Edgar hack shortly before Mr. Clayton publicly disclosed the incident, which indicates they had little or no role in handling the response to it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee is his first since he was confirmed in May. He's bound to face significant pressure to share more details about the hacking episode. His initial efforts have raised almost as many questions as they have answered.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 SEC Chairman Says Agency Didn't Do Enough to Size Up 2016 Hack\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to say Tuesday that his agency may have mishandled a breach of its system for disclosing market-moving news and promise to intensify how it defends itself against hackers.\par \par \uc2 Facing his first crisis as the SEC's chairman, \uc2 Jay Clayton\uc2  suggested in testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday that not enough was done under his predecessor, former chairman Mary Jo White, to size up a 2016 breach that might have provided the basis for insider trading.\par \par \uc2 Ms. White declined to comment through a spokesman.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's handling of the hack\u8212\'20\'14which was disclosed in an unusual and lengthy evening statement last Wednesday\u8212\'20\'14is likely to generate tough questions from senators who already face distress calls from constituents over the hacker attack on \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 ., from which intruders ransacked vast troves of personal information, including social security numbers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, who took over in May under the Trump administration, is expected to say that the regulator must do more to defend against cyberattacks, according to prepared testimony. The SEC late Monday announced the formation of a cyber unit within its enforcement division that will investigate a variety of schemes enabled by technology, including market manipulation and hackers' attempts to steal inside information.\par \par \uc2 Although the breach was reported in 2016 to the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and the security gaps were patched, for months SEC commissioners and a former chief operating officer were unaware of the 2016 hack.\par \par \uc2 The corporate-filing system that was breached, known as Edgar, is the SEC's cornerstone system for storing and disseminating earnings announcements and other news that often moves stock prices.\par \par \uc2 "This matter involving our Edgar system concerns me deeply," said Mr. Clayton's prepared testimony, released Monday by the Senate Banking Committee. "Rightfully, it will cause this committee and others to increase their focus on whether the commission's approach to cybersecurity appropriately addresses our cyberrisk profile."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton's testimony says an ongoing enforcement probe prevents him from revealing much about the cyber break-in. He did disclose that the investigation, which he learned about in August, spurred a second look at the breach.\par \par \uc2 "In August 2017, in connection with an ongoing enforcement investigation by our division of enforcement, I was notified of a possible intrusion into our Edgar system," Mr. Clayton's statement says.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton first disclosed the hack last week in a five-page statement in which he spelled out his approach to cybersecurity, an issue that is fast becoming an Achilles' heel of the financial industry. In addition to Equifax, accounting firm Deloitte said on Monday that it suffered a cyberattack in which an intruder accessed data affecting a "very few" of Deloitte's clients.\par \par \uc2 Democratic senators are expected to question whether Mr. Clayton's statement last week went far enough to inform investors and other SEC watchers about the scope of the hack, leaving corporate finance chiefs to wonder whether it was their firm's confidential information that was compromised.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton's planned Senate comments don't reveal the type of information accessed by hackers in 2016 or what stocks were affected. His statement says SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker is probing the source of the hack, the type of information obtained, and how the SEC responded internally to the breach.\par \par \uc2 The hackers exploited a vulnerability in a part of Edgar that allows companies to test the accuracy of data transmitted in new forms, Mr. Clayton said last week.\par \par \uc2 Hackers didn't obtain any personal information belonging to investors or create "systemic risk" for the financial system, according to Mr. Clayton's Senate testimony.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hoecker's office is separately scheduled to issue an audit in coming weeks after digging into the SEC's history of attempts to upgrade and improve the decades-old Edgar system. The SEC has spent about $69 million since 2013 on Edgar upgrades, according to reports provided to Congress. The SEC funded the projects with a special $50 million annual technology fund that the White House has since proposed eliminating.\par \par \uc2 The SEC has for years been on notice about problems with the Edgar system. In 2014, for instance, academic researchers found that hedge funds and other rapid-fire investors got earlier access to market-moving documents from Edgar than other users of the standard, web-based system, an issue that the SEC later said it fixed. In 2015, a Bulgarian man filed a fake takeover offer for \uc2 Avon Products Inc\uc2 ., which succeeded in sending the beauty-product company's shares soaring.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's response to the 2016 hack is likely to drive questions on Tuesday about whether it can safeguard a vast database of trades that it points to as a way to probe market manipulation and volatile trading sessions like the 2010 "Flash Crash."\par \par \uc2 The Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT, is due to begin receiving data from stock exchanges in November following a multiyear push by the SEC to finish the plan. It would keep track of every trade and order in U.S. stock and option markets and will include personal information on stockbrokers' customers, such as social security numbers and dates of birth.\par \par \uc2 An array of market participants and industry groups have said it is likely to become a major target of hackers seeking to steal trading data and identity thieves.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton entered office calling for deregulatory measures to make it easier for companies to go public. But a barrage of cyberattacks are likely to force him to articulate a strategy for keeping up with market participants and cybercriminals in the age of \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said Andy Green, a former Senate aide and SEC lawyer.\par \par \uc2 "Our markets are more electronic and market participants are more dependent than ever on computerized and algorithmic trading," said Mr. Green, now managing director of economic policy at the liberal \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 . "The SEC needs to focus on getting fully up to speed on data-driven markets, and cyber has to be at the center of that."\par \par \uc2 A bipartisan group of 19 banking committee lawmakers on Monday urged Mr. Clayton to consider updating the SEC's six-year-old guidelines for how companies disclose hacks. The senators urged Mr. Clayton, who as a private lawyer helped lead \uc2 Sullivan & Cromwell LLP\uc2 's cybersecurity practice, to consider whether new regulations are needed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, for his part, has said in previous speeches that more coordination among government agencies was essential to defend against a sophisticated array of hackers, including identity thieves, inside traders, terrorists and state-sponsored groups.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Andrew Ackerman contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 CFTC Wants More Firms to Self-Report Wrongdoing\par \par \uc2 By Gabriel T. Rubin\par \par \uc2 A top U.S. markets regulator unveiled a new enforcement framework that relies more heavily on firms to self-report wrongdoing and gives them new incentives to cooperate with probes.\par \par \uc2 James McDonald, the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 's enforcement director, announced the strategy during a speech at \uc2 New York University\uc2  on Monday. Though the agency already has incentives to encourage firms to cooperate with investigations, the new framework says that penalties will be reduced by a "substantial" amount in cases where the firm fully cooperates.\par \par \uc2 "No matter how much corporate leaders may want to foster compliance within the company, when they detect misconduct their decision whether to voluntarily report it often comes down to their perception of whether they'll be treated fairly," Mr. McDonald said, according to his prepared remarks.\par \par \uc2 The emphasis on rewarding cooperation was already evident toward the end of the Obama administration. In January, the CFTC adopted a set of policies for nonprosecution agreements to clarify what type of cooperation from individuals and companies the regulator could reward as part of an enforcement investigation.\par \par \uc2 "The CFTC, like the Department of Justice and the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , has long made incentivizing self-reporting by companies, and cooperation by individuals and companies, a priority," said Aitan Goelman, Mr. McDonald's predecessor as the CFTC's director of enforcement who is now a partner at the Washington law firm \uc2 Zuckerman Spaeder\uc2 . "I actually don't think that it's that big of a change substantively."\par \par \uc2 The CFTC's move comes as Trump regulatory appointees take a more industry-friendly approach. Mr. Trump has appointed several top regulators with Wall Street pedigrees, including J. Christopher Giancarlo, the CFTC chairman, who has said he wants to simplify existing rules and reassess whether regulators went too far in their implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.\par \par \uc2 "It's always a fairly fine line between relying on self-regulated entities and on the government's own enforcement staff, but puny budgets have made that choice easier," said \uc2 Bart Chilton\uc2 , a former Democratic CFTC commissioner. "That's not ideal, as we have witnessed with the hundreds of violations of financial laws, but it is the rude reality of today."\par \par \uc2 Perhaps anticipating the criticism that the guidelines could be seen in line with a more industry-friendly approach, Mr. McDonald said the policy change "should not be interpreted as giving a pass to companies or individuals."\par \par \uc2 Mr. McDonald, who took over the enforcement division in April following a stint as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said cooperation agreements were an invaluable law-enforcement tool.\par \par \uc2 Using South Bronx criminal gangs as a metaphor, Mr. McDonald said that prosecutions alone "couldn't fix everything." Rather, cooperation from the broader community was necessary to self-report unlawful activity, with law enforcement serving as a "backstop." The vast majority of businesses and market participants want to obey the law, he said.\par \par \uc2 To qualify for the incentives that accompany self-reporting, the company must voluntarily report wrongdoing to the CFTC, and not be under the threat of investigation. The disclosure of wrongdoing must also be explicit and not "tucked away in the depths of some compliance report," Mr. McDonald added.\par \par \uc2 If the firm follows CFTC guidelines for self-reporting, it can expect "concrete benefits" that include substantial penalty reductions and in some circumstances, a recommendation from the agency that the case not be prosecuted.\par \par \uc2 More Company Boards Add Oversight of Political Spending\par \par \uc2 By Theo Francis\par \par \uc2 More large companies are disclosing how they spend to influence government, and company boards are taking on a more direct role in overseeing that spending, a new study finds.\par \par \uc2 Together, the changes underscore the pressure companies face to limit political involvement even after winning the legal right to spend more on elections.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 40% of S&P 500 companies have put political spending and contributions under direct review of a board committee, up from about a third in 2015, according to an annual study by the nonpartisan Center for Political Accountability and researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research.\par \par \uc2 Meantime, board committees at 31% of the companies review payments to trade associations, which often serve as a conduit for campaign and other political spending, up from 24% in 2015, the study found.\par \par \uc2 The CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, in its seventh year, scores companies on how thoroughly they disclose their policies governing a variety of political spending, including state and federal campaign spending, political advertising and payments to trade associations or other entities that engage in political spending. The index doesn't include lobbying spending.\par \par \uc2 Public debate over the role of companies in U.S. elections has simmered since the Supreme Court relaxed restrictions on corporate political spending in 2010. Companies, especially publicly traded ones, continue to account for a relatively small portion of overall spending on federal elections. An analysis by the Conference Board found companies and trade associations accounted for less than 2% of the $7.5 billion spent in the 2016 election cycle; individuals accounted for two thirds of the total.\par \par \uc2 Still, during the most recent proxy season, 49 companies in the S&P 500, including \uc2 Emerson Electric Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway Inc\uc2 ., faced shareholder proposals seeking political-spending reports from companies, \uc2 Ernst & Young\uc2  reported in June. On average, 26% of shares were voted in favor of the proposals.\par \par \uc2 In the end, accountability efforts like the index, along with shareholder resolutions seeking greater disclosure and the risk of consumer backlash, serve as a kind of nongovernmental check on corporate spending, said Robert Yablon, a University of Wisconsin law professor who has written on the subject and wasn't involved in the project.\par \par \uc2 "There are some private forces at work that are resulting in much less corporate money being put into elections than many would have expected," Prof. Yablon said.\par \par \uc2 In this year's index, utilities and companies in the health-care and materials sectors tended to receive the best scores, while real-estate, consumer-discretionary, industrial and technology companies fared worst. Larger companies tended to score higher.\par \par \uc2 The trend toward greater disclosure reflects a growing sense that good corporate governance requires it\u8212\'20\'14but it also provides companies some cover, says Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, which seeks to increase such disclosure.\par \par \uc2 "They recognize that having disclosed, and having policies, lets them better manage their political spending," Mr. Freed said. "It's much easier to say no\u8212\'20\'14then when you say no, it's not personal, it's policy-based."\par \par \uc2 Becton, Dickinson & Co\uc2 ., a maker of medical equipment and supplies, topped this year's rankings. The company sees political disclosures much like those surrounding any other activity, said Elizabeth Woody, vice president of public policy and government relations. "We're proud and confident of what we do, and we're happy to share that with others."\par \par \uc2 The number of S&P 500 companies disclosing at least some dollar figures for political spending fell slightly, to 295 from 305, in part because of turnover in the S&P 500. In addition, more companies are simply prohibiting some or all political expenditures, the group found.\par \par \uc2 About a third of companies in the index forbid at least one type of political spending, most commonly independent expenditures such as company-paid advertising supporting or criticizing candidates.\par \par \uc2 Eight companies spent no corporate assets on elections and requested trade associations and other groups not to use the company's payments to influence elections: \uc2 Accenture PLC\uc2 , \uc2 Automatic Data Processing Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 . , \uc2 Nielsen Holdings NV\uc2 , \uc2 Praxair Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Ralph Lauren Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Schlumberger Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Appeared in the September 26, 2017, print edition as \u8216\'20\'18More Big Firms Put Politics in The Open.'\par \par \uc2 Big Investors Want Directors to Stop Sitting On So Many Boards\par \par \uc2 By Sarah Krouse and Joann S.

Overstretched directors lack time to adequately monitor management, these critics contend.\par \par \uc2 "There is no good reason for having an overboarded director,'' said Charles Elson, head of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at \uc2 University of Delaware\uc2 . He expects institutional-investor pressure will make S&P 500 board members with at least five seats a dying breed.\par \par \uc2 Many directors who serve multiple boards contend that they adequately manage their time and can handle their board responsibilities.\par \par \uc2 A new analysis of S&P 500 chief executives for The Wall Street Journal by \uc2 Equilar\uc2 , a research firm, suggests that leaders with multiple outside corporate board seats and their employers make more money, but their shareholders see lower returns than those with one or zero outside directorships.\par \par \uc2 Money managers such as BlackRock and State Street with large index-tracking fund businesses are gaining more power over shareholder votes because they own growing stakes in so many publicly held corporations. Both voted against Mr. Havner's AvalonBay re-election in each of the last two years.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, cast 168 votes against directors this year due to overboarding concerns. It fought the reelection of directors at companies such as \uc2 Charter Communications Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Pfizer Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 PayPal Holdings , Inc\uc2 ., according to filings and a spokesman for the money manager.\par \par \uc2 "The directors that serve on many boards tend to be very strong directors," said Zach Oleksiuk, head of BlackRock's Americas corporate governance and responsible investment team. "The issue is not necessarily their performance, but rather the time that it takes to serve."\par \par \uc2 Being a director is lucrative, time-consuming and often comes with a high profile. Median total compensation for U.S. public board members was $191,440 last year, according to the \uc2 National Association of Corporate Directors\uc2  and pay consultants Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, up about 3% from the prior year.\par \par \uc2 Board members at public companies spend an average of 245 hours a year for each position, up from 191 hours in 2005, according to surveys by the \uc2 National Association of Corporate Directors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Influential proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and \uc2 Glass, Lewis & Co\uc2 . now recommend investors vote against or withhold support from directors who sit on more than five public-company boards. ISS lowered that threshold to five in February from six. Each firm also favors limits on the number of outside directorships chief executives can hold.\par \par \uc2 American corporations increasingly have imposed their own restrictions. About 77% of S&P 500 companies now curb board members' outside directorships in some fashion, up from 71% in 2010, according to \uc2 Spencer Stuart\uc2 , an executive-search firm. Among those with limits for all directors, 36% now impose a cap of three seats\u8212\'20\'14up from 29% in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Overall, 63 S&P 500 directors now serve on five or more public boards, as of Sept. 10, down from 83 in 2012, \u8203\'20\'0Baccording to ISS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the data arm of \uc2 Institutional Shareholder Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some directors were re-elected this year despite opposition from some large shareholders. For example, BlackRock withheld support for the re-election of \uc2 Ann Mather\uc2  at \uc2 Shutterfly , Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 ., but she was re-elected at both companies.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mather also serves on the board of three other West Coast public companies: \uc2 Arista Networks Inc\uc2 . ; \uc2 Netflix Inc\uc2 . ; and \uc2 Glu Mobile Inc\uc2 . She deliberately chose businesses in the same or related industries with headquarters near each other, one person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 The person said this week that the businesses are "all connected and relevant,'' which means Ms. Mather "can easily add value and (has) a strategic understanding of what's going on.''\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0BAnother big index-fund manager, Vanguard Group, doesn't explicitly put a limit on the number of boards on which someone can serve but looks at factors such as board members' "attendance, engagement, and effectiveness," a spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0BRival State Street Global Advisors in 2016 cast votes against 69 chief executives who served on more than three boards and against 22 non-CEO directors who each sat on more than six public boards.

Work on the measure may be delayed as the Senate continues to debate a last-ditch effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act, they said.\par \par \uc2 At issue is a CFPB rule approved in July barring fine-print requirements that consumers use arbitration to resolve disputes over financial services.

The House voted 231-190 to overturn the rule in July.\par \par \uc2 To date, the Senate hasn't mustered the votes necessary to kill the rule. Democrats are likely to back the CFPB regulation, and the Republicans' slim majority means they likely can't afford to lose more than two GOP votes.

At the end of the trust's life, investors can receive cash equal to the net asset value of the units or they can roll the current value of their investments into another trust.\par \par \uc2 Finra fined \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  $3.25 million, while the bank will have to pay about $9.78 million in restitution to more than 3,000 customers.\par \par \uc2 "Due to the long-term nature of UITs, their structure, and upfront costs, short-term trading of UITs may be improper and raises suitability concerns," said Susan Schroeder, Finra executive vice president and head of enforcement.\par \par \uc2 In settling the investigation, \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of Finra's findings.\par \par \uc2 Brexit Conundrum: What To Do With Thousands of Derivatives Contracts\par \par \uc2 By Max Colchester\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  said Monday that the U.K. and the \uc2 European Union\uc2  need to reach an agreement to protect the validity of trillions of dollars' worth of derivatives contracts after Brexit.\par \par \uc2 Without authorization to do business in the EU, British-based banks likely will seek to write European derivatives contracts from an EU entity. That would mean redrafting thousands of contracts, a task the \uc2 central bank's Financial Policy Committee\uc2  said would be unprecedented and difficult to execute.\par \par \uc2 Big banks have derivative contracts with up to 4,000 other institutions, who themselves have contracts with several entities. Hunting them all down and getting them to approve the changes could take a long time.\par \par \uc2 Rather, the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  says a deal between the U.K. and the EU to protect the validity of existing contracts would be the most straightforward solution. That would be "likely to require the development and passage of legislation in both jurisdictions," the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Some bankers point to Switzerland as a potential model. Switzerland isn't in the EU, but it has signed bilateral agreements with the trading bloc on issues including trade and transportation, but not financial services.\par \par \uc2 Without a solution on the existing derivatives contracts, European clients of British-based banks may find themselves unable to do things like exercising their option to buy or sell securities. The \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  says tens of thousands of institutions, or a about a quarter of both U.K. and EU uncleared derivative contracts, could be affected.\par \par \uc2 The U.K.'s central bank has consulted the \uc2 International Swaps and Derivatives Association\uc2  as it looks to better understand the problem. The association has been providing information including a look at what different rules allow in six European jurisdictions. One key question: What flexibility so local laws allow to change the terms of contracts already issued out of the U.K.\par \par \uc2 Trying to maintain the huge pool of derivatives contracts in London is a key battleground for British authorities. The business of clearing these contracts has attracted huge amounts of liquidity and expertise to London, helping underpin its position as a global financial hub.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year the \uc2 European Union\uc2 's executive arm proposed plans that could force clearinghouses that do a large of chunk of business in euros to move into the EU. Moving the approximately EUR83 trillion ($98 trillion) of euro-denominated interest rate contracts out of the U.K. would force European banks to hold an extra EUR30 to EUR40 billion of collateral, according to a recent study by \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Analysis: The Modern IPO is Useless. Let's Reinvent It\par \par \uc2 By James Mackintosh\par \par \uc2 A golden age of financial innovation is with us, so it's time to reinvent the IPO. Again.\par \par \uc2 The latest attempt comes from a $690 million shell company set up by Chamath Palihapitiya, a tech-to-private-equity executive, and Ian Osborne, a British political-PR man turned technology adviser.\par \par \uc2 The project has ambitions so grand that the pair have trademarked "IPO 2.0," and picked IPOA as the ticker symbol for what they plan to be the first of many blank-check companies, \uc2 Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp\uc2 . They hope to work their way up toward IPOZ.\par \par \uc2 The project is perfectly plausible, and might well work out. But we should be wary of what is another sign of the willingness of investors to put their trust and their money into financial experiments. As bull markets run on, financial innovation becomes more acceptable and trust more widespread.\par \par \uc2 The idea of reinventing the initial public offering last appeared as the dot-com boom was nearing its zenith. In Europe and the U.S., technology-focused IPO specialists started selling shares directly to retail customers by linking up with online brokerages. Not surprisingly, many of the companies\u8212\'20\'14and in Germany, the Neuer Markt on which they were usually listed\u8212\'20\'14vanished when the boom turned to bust.\par \par \uc2 The same is true of cash shells. So far this year, $7.6 billion has been raised, according to Dealogic, the most since the record $12 billion raised in 2007. Handing over money to strangers is easier when the market is booming and trust is high.\par \par \uc2 Yet, critics then and now of the IPO process are right. Companies planning an IPO pick underwriters among the Wall Street banks. Because the banks are on the hook to buy the shares if investors don't subscribe enough, they have an incentive to underprice the issue to reduce their potential losses.\par \par \uc2 The too-low price creates excess demand for the shares, since they are artificially cheap, so banks have to ration the supply. Rationing is typically done by giving bigger allocations to their best clients, who do well from the usual first-day pop in price that results from the underpricing.\par \par \uc2 On top of that, preparing for an IPO involves stressful months of form-filling. An IPO brings an influx of new investors unknown to the company's founders. Plus employees typically are restricted from selling shares for a six-month lockup period.\par \par \uc2 Messrs. Palihapitiya and Osborne aim to fix this process. They want tech "unicorns" worth above $1 billion to use a reverse takeover of the cash shell to gain a stock-market listing without all of the regulation and kerfuffle of an IPO.\par \par \uc2 The 25 big shareholders who hold almost all of the SCHH stock would get to know the target company first, the price would be set by negotiation between the company's board, its big shareholders and the target, and\u8212\'20\'14if they were right\u8212\'20\'14there would be no first-day pop. Lockups would be smarter, with some employees able to cash in right away, while founders and late-stage venture capitalists might still be locked in.\par \par \uc2 The system is both beautiful and silly. There are drawbacks for shareholders: They have to commit their cash upfront, with no way to know how long it will be until a target company is found. When the target is found, they have the choice to pull out and get their money back, under the rules governing blank-check companies. But if they opt out, they might not be allowed into IPOB, C or D.\par \par \uc2 They are also expected to stick with the company after the deal, so they can't rely on a quick profit from what is known as "stagging" the deal by selling out as soon as the shares leap.\par \par \uc2 Companies get a quicker listing with less administrative hassle, are likely to get a more stable stock price after the deal, and end up with a relatively small number of committed shareholders.\par \par \uc2 If it were purely a matter of matching investors willing to commit for the long term against a management eager to have long-term investors, it would be fine, if wildly overpriced (more on that later). But here the tension between investors and issuers comes back. Investors are giving up flexibility by handing over their cash now, without even knowing what company might be the SCHH target, and should expect to pay a lower price in return for such a long-term view.\par \par \uc2 Yet, a big part of the appeal from the company's point of view is that they don't have to offer the stock-price discount that the investment banks impose in a traditional IPO.\par \par \uc2 If the price comes in about the same, the promise of stock stability and less regulation might satisfy both sides\u8212\'20\'14although the high fees that SCHH is charging hardly seem worth it. After a deal, it gets 20% of the cash raised, paid in equity, against a typical 7% Wall Street underwriting fee, although post-listing advice from Mr. Palihapitiya's private-equity group, Social Capital, is thrown in.\par \par \uc2 There are other alternatives. \uc2 WR Hambrecht & Co\uc2 . offers an auction where investors bid for stock and say what they are willing to pay. The process was used by \uc2 Google\uc2  for its 2004 IPO, underwritten by \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , but hasn't caught on.\par \par \uc2 The best option would be to fix the existing IPO. Lockup periods on shareholders could easily be smarter. Investment banks could bring a variant of the auction process into their price-setting to reduce the first-day pop. And the company coming to market could get more say over the type of investor who gets stock, reducing the banks' ability to help their clients.\par \par \uc2 The willingness of investors to back SCHH shows how fed up they are with the traditional IPO. But it also shows how ready they are to put their trust, and $690 million, in a financial experiment. It is one more sign that the bull market is growing old.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: CFTC's Bowen Urges Rule Completion in Farewell Address\par \par \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Sharon Bowen urges the regulator to finish several outstanding rules in a farewell address at \uc2 Georgetown University\uc2 .

Giving the benefit of the doubt, Nomura says it's possible that there were administrative hurdles as the payment was Venezuela's first since recent financial sanctions leveled by the US. But "if this is a valid excuse, then there wouldn't be any other operational delays for the next coupon payment on September 30," Nomura says. Cash-strapped Venezuela has nearly $4 billion in bond payments due in the remainder of 2017. Nomura expects the government to make good on the payments thanks to supportive oil prices and allies like Russia being more flexible with debt-repayment terms.

It was "as good as missing the forest for the trees," added Pan Guangwei, party secretary of the China Banking Association. The bankers, speaking at a press conference hosted by the \uc2 State Council Information Office\uc2 , offered their own argument for why Chinese credit is healthy: Economic growth has been better than expected this year and corporate profits margins are at 5-year highs. Meanwhile, banks' average nonperforming-loan ratio has stabilized. Pan added S&P overlooked the government's determination to deleverage and concluded that when compared to GDP, China's debt level is in line with that of Japan, Germany and the UK.

"The audit... focused on a review of the bank's procedures for the implementation of the regulatory framework, as well as risk management procedures and special credit issues," the bank's statement says. \uc2 Bank of Greece\uc2 's audit has been transferred to a Greek prosecutor, according to Greek officials. They concerned violations in capital controls and irregularities in loans issuance by several bank officials. The bank considers that the issues covered by the BoG audit are adequately reflected in its financial statements and does not anticipate any material financial or capital impact to arise. It also notes that over the past six months, it has proceeded to a significant overhaul of its senior management and corporate governance structures, including a thorough review and reinforcement of its internal control framework and internal processes. The bank's shares are down 5.26%.

Studying more than 40 financial crises, researchers found the severity of a crisis can be forecast by the size of credit losses, or the change in spreads, and the fragility of the financial sector, as measured by precrisis credit growth.

The issuer, the first of its kind to go to initial public offering, is expected to start trading on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  to simplify insurance, price risk more finely and distribute cheaply to a mass market via the internet. The business concept is resonating with investors, propelling a batch of start-up insurers to rapid expansion thanks to generous private-equity funding.\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn\u8217\'20\'19s peers are not exactly household names but private equity players definitely know who they are. Start-ups such as Lemonade Insurance in the US and Gryphon in the UK have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from this market. US-based Oscar Health last year raised $400m from private investors, valuing it at $2.7bn.\par \par \uc2 The funding has set up some of the groups for the obvious next step \u8212\'20\'14 a chunky IPO at a rich valuation, from which private equity money can profitably exit.\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn is backed by some of China\u8217\'20\'19s largest online financial services groups and its public debut has attracted prominent cornerstone investors such as Japan\u8217\'20\'19s SoftBank.\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn\u8217\'20\'19s business model chimes with investors: it sells high volumes of online-only insurance products by partnering with a number of China\u8217\'20\'19s biggest internet groups.\par \par \uc2 The company has sold 5.8bn policies to 460m customers over a three-year period, an almost unfathomable sales record for a traditional insurance group. It said that on a single day in November it sold 100m shipping return policies during an online shopping holiday.\par \par \uc2 The company\u8217\'20\'19s biggest sellers are connected to industries that have had the most growth in China in recent years, such as travel and health, says Linda Sun-Mattison, an analyst at Bernstein.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere has been growth in travel insurance. There is demand for flight delay insurance because a lot of flights are delayed,\u8221\'20\'1D she says. \u8220\'20\'1CThere has also been a lot of growth in health \u8212\'20\'14 their health insurance is much cheaper than competitors\u8217\'20\'19. It is in very high demand.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn has excellent backers: \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2 , Tencent and \uc2 Ping An Insurance\uc2 . Ant, an affiliate of Alibaba, operates China\u8217\'20\'19s largest retail payments platform, and Tencent runs the country\u8217\'20\'19s top mobile messaging service. Ping An is one of China\u8217\'20\'19s largest insurers.\par \par \uc2 The internet companies give ZhongAn access to hundreds of millions of consumers.\par \par \uc2 For example, its top-selling product, a shipping return policy, is sold directly on Alibaba\u8217\'20\'19s shopping platform Taobao and allows shoppers to insure the cost of returning products to vendors. Ctrip, China\u8217\'20\'19s largest online travel group, has helped ZhongAn market \u8220\'20\'1Cflight delay\u8221\'20\'1D insurance, which allows customers to insure against late flights. Customers can buy \u8220\'20\'1Ccracked screen\u8221\'20\'1D insurance when they buy a phone from the website of Xiaomi, a Chinese phonemaker.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt has advantaged access to customers where other insurtech doesn\u8217\'20\'19t,\u8221\'20\'1D says Richard Hatherall, a partner at \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2  in Hong Kong. \u8220\'20\'1CIt actually has many of the characteristics of big tech.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The company uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  to assess the risk of the short-maturity products. Flight-delay insurance can price in weather factors in real time for policies sold just hours before departure time.\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn straddles the lines of tech start-up and large insurer, and that is a hard act for its peers to follow.\par \par \uc2 Lemonade, for example, has broken ground with its use of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the insurance industry, Mr Hatherall says. Yet it does not yet know how to reach large numbers of customers.\par \par \uc2 The same applies to many other insurtech groups: Oscar Health has simplified how customers access health insurance; Clover Health uses data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to get senior citizens better healthcare services; Ladder Life has streamlined signing up for life insurance.\par \par \uc2 Many of these companies may eventually be pushed to partner with traditional insurance groups to access new customers.\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn\u8217\'20\'19s business model has its drawbacks too. The company expects to post a loss in 2017. In the first three months of the year, it posted a net loss of Rmb202m, according to its prospectus.\par \par \uc2 Ms Sun-Mattison says ZhongAn\u8217\'20\'19s costs are inflated by payments to partners \u8212\'20\'14 its cost ratio is almost double that at some other insurers. That depresses profits. And, she points out, ZhongAn relies on those partners to generate top-line growth.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe question is who needs who more,\u8221\'20\'1D she says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170925ed9p0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hartford's biggest bond insurer said it had offered to help the city postpone payments on as much as $300 million in outstanding debt, in a move designed to help prevent a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hartford-warns-it-will-file-for-bankruptcy-unless-state-provides-a-bailout-1504800558"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bankruptcy filing for Connecticut's capital }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The insurer, \uc2 Assured Guaranty Ltd\uc2 ., made the announcement before a Monday conference call between Hartford and its bondholders.\par \par \uc2 During the call Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said postponement of the city's debt would be inadequate without other fixes such as more revenue from the state, according to a statement released by the city after the call.\par \par \uc2 "I appreciate Assured's willingness to have constructive discussions," the mayor said, according to the statement, but "this administration is not interested in pushing off this challenge for another mayor or another generation to fix."\par \par \uc2 Under Assured Guaranty's proposal, debt payments due in the next 15 years would instead be spread out over the next 30 years without bankruptcy or default. The city would issue new longer-dated bonds and use the proceeds to make the near-term debt payments.\par \par \uc2 Assured Guaranty and another insurer, Build America Mutual, would insure the new bonds, said an Assured Guaranty spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Assured Guaranty backs 57% of Hartford's roughly $550 million in outstanding general obligation debt and would be on the hook for any shortfall in payments should the city enter bankruptcy. Build America Mutual backs $103 million in Hartford debt. About $163 million in Hartford bonds are held by U.S. mutual funds.\par \par \uc2 Hartford is in the middle of a fiscal emergency because of a weak tax base and a budget deficit of nearly $50 million. It also has one of the lowest credit ratings in the nation. Making matters worse, Connecticut lawmakers have been unable to reach agreement on a state budget {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/connecticut-municipalities-press-state-lawmakers-on-budget-plan-1504121103"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 more than two months into the fiscal year }}}\uc2 , leaving Hartford short of state funding.\par \par \uc2 City officials have warned that the city would likely file for bankruptcy this fall unless the state provides more help. Mayor Luke Bronin has said the city cannot afford to make its bond payments on time and will need to restructure its debt even if Hartford does receive state assistance.\par \par \uc2 The offer from Assured Guaranty would provide Hartford with short-term budgetary relief but wouldn't reduce the city's total liabilities. In fact, it would add to them because delaying when the debt comes due would increase interest costs.\par \par \uc2 The city's debt payments are scheduled to jump from $6.6 million to $56 million in the next four years, according to city financial disclosures. Assured Guaranty's plan would lower those payments by pushing some of the debt out as far as 2047.\par \par \uc2 It is common for states to issue bonds as a way of refunding old debt, both to take advantage of low interest rates and to put off debt payments. But Hartford, which is rated deep in junk status and has hired restructuring advisers, would likely be unable to complete such a deal without insurance.\par \par \uc2 "Once you hire restructuring advisers, investors steer clear," said \uc2 Matt Fabian\uc2 , partner at Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a municipal bond research firm.\par \par \uc2 Of cities rated by \uc2 Moody's Investors Service\uc2 , only Stockton, Calif., which emerged from bankruptcy protection two years ago, and Atlantic City, N.J., which narrowly avoided it, have lower ratings than Hartford.\par \par \uc2 Assured Guaranty's proposal takes advantage of state legislation passed in July that for the next five years allows cities to refinance debt with 30-year bonds instead of restricting them to 20-year bonds.\par \par \uc2 Hartford could receive more than $40 million in aid under one version of Connecticut's fiscal 2018 budget, which state lawmakers are still debating. But that alone wouldn't be enough to keep Hartford out of bankruptcy, the city said in a notice about Monday's conference call.\par \par \uc2 Assured Guaranty's proposal wouldn't help Hartford solve all its problems. A continued delay in the budget could strain the city's ability to make payment on a $20 million short-term loan due on Oct. 31.\par \par \uc2 The insurer's proposal could be "a part of the solution," said the Assured Guaranty spokesman. "It's not the solution in itself."\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Gillers at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:heather.gillers@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 heather.gillers@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170925ed9p001mf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Equifax Inc. Chief Executive \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  told a breakfast meeting in mid-August that data fraud is a "huge opportunity" for the credit-reporting company, allowing it to sell consumers more offerings.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith, who goes by Rick, said young people should sign up for the company's credit-monitoring offerings, according to a video recording of the meeting at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business. Mr. Smith was responding to an audience question and said protecting consumer data was "a huge priority" for the company.\par \par \uc2 What the audience didn't know, and Mr. Smith didn't mention: Less than three weeks earlier, \uc2 Equifax\uc2  had discovered a systems breach and called in \uc2 Mandiant\uc2 , the cyber-investigations division of \uc2 FireEye Inc\uc2 ., to investigate. That inquiry uncovered a massive attack that exposed vital personal information of potentially 143 million Americans, something \uc2 Equifax\uc2  didn't announce until Sept. 7.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith's remarks add to questions from consumers, regulators and politicians about what \uc2 Equifax\uc2  knew, when it knew and whether it took sufficient steps to safeguard its data. They also underscore how focused Mr. Smith has been on getting and selling more data.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith and \uc2 Equifax\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Until the hack was announced, the drive for data had helped both Mr. Smith and \uc2 Equifax\uc2  prosper. After taking the helm of the company 12 years ago this week, Mr. Smith transformed \uc2 Equifax\uc2  from what he once described as a staid, slow-growing credit-reporting company into a data giant.\par \par \uc2 He bought companies with databases that contained information about consumers' employment histories, salaries and savings while also expanding internationally to places such as Australia and India.\par \par \uc2 The result: by 2016, credit-reporting activities accounted for less than a third of revenues versus about 80% a decade earlier.Equifax's market value soared to nearly $18 billion, more than quadruple its value when Mr. Smith started.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith also has done well financially: Over his time as CEO, he has taken home about $127 million in total compensation, according to securities filings.\par \par \uc2 The breach upended it all. \uc2 Equifax\uc2  has faced heated criticism from angry consumers, politicians and its own customers. The company is under investigation by regulators even as the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  probes the hack. The shares have lost over a quarter of their value since \uc2 Equifax\uc2  disclosed the incident, though they rose 6.9% Friday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith, meanwhile, will testify before Congress in coming weeks. He hasn't spoken publicly since the hack was disclosed, except for a video \uc2 Equifax\uc2  released at that time. In an article he wrote for \uc2 USA Today\uc2 , Mr. Smith said the incident was the"most humbling moment in our 118-year history."\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  decided to hold off on immediately informing the public of its breach until the company had more clarity on the number of people affected and the types of information that were compromised, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 People who worked with Mr. Smith describe him as being in constant motion, always focused on an objective and looking to move on.\par \par \uc2 He was the same outside the office. "He plays speed golf," said a person who knows him. "I never had a three-putt with Rick. You putt once, and he gives you the second one because he's ready to go to the next hole."\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Smith came to \uc2 Equifax\uc2  he looked to change the company and its culture, he said in his University of Georgia remarks.\par \par \uc2 He added he wanted to turn \uc2 Equifax\uc2  into a "global data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company." To do so, Mr. Smith acquired and monetized countless pieces ofdata on consumers' financial lives, allowing lenders, landlords and insurance companies, among others, to make decisions ranging from extending credit to hiring job seekers to renting an apartment.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Equifax\uc2  grew quickly, competitors privately criticized the company's technological abilities, saying it was more focused on growing data sets. \uc2 Equifax\uc2  "came to the software party very late," said an industry executive.\par \par \uc2 After the breach, questions have arisen in information-security communities about whether and when \uc2 Equifax\uc2  patched a software vulnerability that gave hackers entry to the company's servers. \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , while saying it "took efforts" to patch systems when the vulnerability was reported in early March, acknowledged the questions and said its review "is ongoing."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Robert McMillan contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170924ed9p0000k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Accounting firm Deloitte said Monday it had suffered a cyberattack in which a hacker accessed data affecting a "very few" of Deloitte's clients.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Deloitte said it had contacted all of the affected clients and that "no disruption has occurred to client businesses, to Deloitte's ability to continue to serve clients, or to consumers" as a result of the incident, The firm said it notified government authorities immediately after it became aware of the breach.\par \par \uc2 Deloitte said the hacker accessed data from an email platform. The firm said it has conducted "an intensive and thorough review" of the incident, using cybersecurity and confidentiality specialists both inside of Deloitte and outside the firm.\par \par \uc2 Much isn't known about the hack, though, and a Deloitte spokeswoman declined to comment beyond a statement from the firm. Deloitte didn't say what kind of information was compromised, how the hacking was accomplished, or in what country it took place. While Deloitte is a global organization, it is comprised of individual partnerships in each country where it does business.\par \par \uc2 Deloitte also didn't specify to which governmental authorities it had reported the breach. A spokeswoman for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, Deloitte's U.S. regulator, said the board was "monitoring the situation carefully" and that auditors "have a professional responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of their client's information."\par \par \uc2 The Financial Reporting Council\uc2 , Deloitte's regulator in the U.K., declined to comment on the hack. The \uc2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 News of the Deloitte hack follows two other major data breaches reported in recent weeks. Credit-reporting company \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . said Sept. 7 that hackers had {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-entered-equifax-systems-in-march-1505943617"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 gained access}}}\uc2  to personal data the company held on potentially 143 million Americans. The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  said last Wednesday that its Edgar corporate-filing system {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hack-response-opens-sec-to-criticism-1506024730"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 had been hacked}}}\uc2  last year and that the thieves could have benefited from access to nonpublic information.\par \par \uc2 The cyberbreach at Deloitte was first reported by the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper. The Guardian said Deloitte discovered the hack in March, and that it compromised the confidential emails and plans of some of the firm's blue-chip clients.\par \par \uc2 Krebs on Security, a security-news website run by cyber expert Brian Krebs, quoted a source close to the investigation as saying that the Deloitte hack compromised the company's entire internal email system and all administrator accounts. The Deloitte spokeswoman couldn't immediately be reached for comment on the Krebs assertions.\par \par \uc2 Deloitte is one of the world's largest professional-services firms, with $38.8 billion in revenue in the fiscal year that ended May 31. It audits hundreds of public companies in the U.S. alone, including about 20% of the companies in the S&P 500, according to data and research firm Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The firm also provides tax services, as well as consulting services that assist companies in areas like mergers and acquisitions, coping with global economic change, and risk. The latter includes consulting on cyberrisk, which Deloitte called "a high growth area" earlier this month\par \par \uc2 According to Deloitte's U.S. website, its cyberrisk services help customers "get ahead of cyberrisk so your business can keep moving forward." The firm offers services like helping clients protect sensitive data and reduce the risk of data breaches; monitoring and detection capabilities to identify malicious cyberactivity; customized research to help companies identify emerging cyberthreats and take pre-emptive action; "war gaming" and simulations to help prepare a company to cope with a hack; and response and recovery services if an attack should occur.\par \par \uc2 Deloitte and other major accounting firms have long been concerned about the possibility that they themselves could be targets of a cyberattack. Their businesses result in them holding large amounts of confidential financial data on many of the world's largest companies, making them attractive potential targets for hackers.\par \par \uc2 A 2017 audit transparency report issued by Deloitte's U.K. firm said the risk of a cyberattack is "an area of considerable focus" for the firm, and protection of its clients' data is of "paramount importance." The firm "invests heavily" in cyberdefenses, the report said, and conducts annual cyber-crisis management exercises while reviewing its readiness for a cyberattack on a continuing basis.\par \par \uc2 "We're in the business of trust and that's something we don't take lightly," Jon Raphael, chief innovation officer at \uc2 Deloitte & Touche LLP\uc2  in the U.S., told The Wall Street Journal in a 2015 interview.\par \par \uc2 Write to Michael Rapoport at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Read More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-entered-equifax-systems-in-march-1505943617"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Hackers Entered Equifax Systems in March}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hack-response-opens-sec-to-criticism-1506024730"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Hack Response Opens SEC to Criticism}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-latest-weapon-cyber-extortion-1505295003"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Hackers' Latest Weapon: Cyber Extortion}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2017/05/16/cyber-attack-finance-skills/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Cyberattack Highlights Lack of Tech Skills in Finance Departments}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170925ed9p003e9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Today it targets deals in the services, industrials and technology, media and telecommunications sectors, having left the health-care, consumer and leisure, and renewable energy sectors in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Adam Turtle, co-founder of placement agent Rede Partners LLP\u8212\'20\'14which worked on HgCapital's more than \u163\'00\'A33.1 billion round of fundraising for two separate funds in February\u8212\'20\'14said: "He has got a very clear view of the sorts of companies he wants to buy\u8230\'20\'26it feels like you're investing in a rigorous and very predictable system for money."\par \par \uc2 He said HgCapital's latest buyout fund, which closed on \u163\'00\'A32.5 billion in February, could have easily have raised more than \u163\'00\'A33 billion alone, putting that down to the firm's change of tack. He said Mr. Humphries' technology background\u8212\'20\'14he has long led HgCapital's technology, media and telecommunications team and worked ahead of \uc2 Barclays Private Equity\uc2 's IT and telecoms team before joining HgCapital in 2001\u8212\'20\'14has had a significant impact on the firm's strategy.\par \par \uc2 "[Technology] was considered a dangerous word from a fundraising perspective because it brought back memories of the dot-com crash," he said. "What he's brought to HgCapital is this wealth of technology expertise and really a focus on technology, which now puts them in an extremely good position\u8230\'20\'26they have had a huge head-start on everyone else."\par \par \uc2 Parallel to its latest buyout fund, HgCapital raised \u163\'00\'A3575 million for its second Mercury growth fund within three months, according to a statement. Its first Mercury fund returned about 80% of its invested capital to date and is valued at a 2.1 times gross multiple with a 41% gross IRR, according to the firm.\par \par \uc2 One investor said: "The knowledge they [the firm] can take from one experience and apply to another is quite significant."\par \par \uc2 Fundraising\par \par \uc2 The firm's eighth buyout fund and second technology growth fund were oversubscribed, according to Steven Batchelor, a partner who heads client services at HgCapital.\par \par \uc2 The buyout fund was more than three times oversubscribed in just one month and succeeded the seventh vehicle's \u163\'00\'A32 billion final close in April 2013, raising \u163\'00\'A32.5 billion by February 2017, according to the firm.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Batchelor said: "We're not always going to be this lucky. The market is very positive at the moment and we will definitely be in another fundraising market when it is difficult."\par \par \uc2 He said the private-equity firm's seventh fund is valued at 1.5-times more than the cost of its investments.\par \par \uc2 Not far from his mind is HgCapital's sixth fund, which despite launching the day after \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  filed for bankruptcy raised \u163\'00\'A31.9 billion within 18 months in the market.\par \par \uc2 HgCapital's latest buyout fund, which had a reuptake rate of 90%, received a \u163\'00\'A3350 million from its cornerstone investor \uc2 HgCapital Trust\uc2 , compared with \u163\'00\'A3200 million for its seventh vehicle.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Batchelor joined the firm 14 years ago, its investor base was entirely U.K.-based. Today, 40% of its clients are from North America and 40% from Europe, with the remainder from regions including Asia and the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 The fundraising follows respectable returns for the firm's previous funds.\par \par \uc2 Its seventh fund is valued at 1.5 times cost, he said, "but it's very early in its life" so could generate higher returns. It currently has a gross net internal rate of return\u8212\'20\'14an annualized measure of performance\u8212\'20\'14of almost 30%, according to Mr. Batchelor. The fund has exited one investment ahead of schedule\u8212\'20\'14Personal & Informatik, a German payroll and HR-related software provider that generated a 2.3-times return and a 36% IRR when HgCapital sold the business to buyout firm \uc2 Permira\uc2  in September last year.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, its 2009-vintage sixth fund is currently marked at just more than two-times cost and is expected to generate an IRR in the midteens, according to Mr. Batchelor.\par \par \uc2 Mercury, led by Matthew Brockman, a managing partner and chairman of the firm's investment committee, reflects HgCapital's attempts to hone its sector focus. In addition to leaving the consumer and health-care sectors, HgCapital said in April last year that it would support its incumbent renewable energy team in its spinout as Asper Investment Management.\par \par \uc2 Deals\par \par \uc2 HgCapital plans to do more exits in future and is taking a cautious stance on investments, according to Mr. Brockman. So far this year, HgCapital has sold six of its investments and expects more in the coming months as it focuses on returning capital to investors.\par \par \uc2 It already has returned about \u163\'00\'A31.4 billion of capital to investors from those exits and three refinancings this year\u8212\'20\'14about four times the sum it's invested since the start of the year.\par \par \uc2 In August, the firm's first Mercury fund sold software company Sequel Business Solutions to U.S. \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provider \uc2 Verisk \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The deal took Mercury One's returns to three-times invested cost and a gross IRR on realized investments of about 44%, according to a statement at the time.\par \par \uc2 In June, HgCapital sold Danish hosting provider Zitcom Group to trade buyer Intelligent for a 3.3 times return and an approximately 145% gross IRR after 18 months of ownership, according to a statement from HgCapital at the time. The same month it sold U.K. automotive parts distributor Parts Alliance to Canadian auto products distributor \uc2 Uni-Select\uc2  for \u163\'00\'A3205 million.\par \par \uc2 It has also sold German meter reading systems maker Qundis, software company E-conomic and U.K. vehicle leasing company Zenith. Its investments this year include Visma Group, in which HgCapital has reinvested twice.\par \par \uc2 The firm initially invested \u163\'00\'A3101 million in the software provider through its fifth fund in 2006\u8212\'20\'14it owned 100% of the company after a take-private that valued Visma at \u163\'00\'A3382 million.\par \par \uc2 The firm then sold two-thirds of its stake to buyout firm \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . in 2010 and reinvested in the company in 2014 with its seventh fund through a consortium with \uc2 KKR\uc2  and buyout firm \uc2 Cinven\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In June, HgCapital invested a further \u163\'00\'A3238 million in Visma in another club deal, giving the company an enterprise value of NOK 45 billion ($5.3 billion at the time). HgCapital led the deal, which gave it 41% of the company's equity. Consortium members \uc2 Cinven\uc2 , sovereign-wealth fund GIC, buyout firm \uc2 Montagu Private Equity\uc2  and debt investor \uc2 Intermediate Capital Group\uc2  took minority positions in the company.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Humphries said HgCapital wants to give its investors longer-term exposure to more high-growth businesses such as Visma.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Humphries said: "The benefit is [that] although they [businesses like Visma] generate great cash, they're businesses that systemically grow. They grow revenues of three to four times GDP every year and they do that through good cycles and bad\u8230\'20\'26When we do manage to find them and they perform well, we've got a bias toward continued exposure to the great returns they generate."\par \par \uc2 Also in June, HgCapital bought \uc2 Esendex Ltd\uc2 . a business messaging service company, from \uc2 Darwin Private Equity\uc2  in the last deal from its first Mercury fund. Meanwhile, in April it led a deal for software company Mitratech alongside private-equity house \uc2 TA Associates\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 An investor in HgCapital who declined to be named was attracted to the style of HgCapital's deals\u8212\'20\'14increasingly technology with a particular focus on software, stable revenues and large customer bases.\par \par \uc2 Succession\par \par \uc2 The firm's 15 partners range in age from their mid-30s to mid-50s, meaning retirement for some is expected in the next five years. However, further generational change is likely to be far down the road for HgCapital, as Mr. Humphries was just 39 when he took charge a decade ago. Most members of the firm's senior bench are in their 40s.\par \par \uc2 He said: "Over the last three or four years we've tried to spread management at the firm across a number of people and we have Matthew [Brockman], Matthew Rourke [head of services investments], Justin Von Simson [head of the Munich office], Stephen Bough [chief operating officer] and all of those people share different management responsibilities.\par \par \uc2 "You can take one or two people and give them 100% management responsibility [but] you stop them from making investments and realizations."\par \par \uc2 Write to Jennifer Bollen at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jennifer.bollen@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jennifer.bollen@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20170925ed9p00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The Toronto-based startup's technology pulls from sources including public biological data repositories and patient genetic data to identify variants of disease that could be manipulated through medicine.\par \par \uc2 "From a huge data set of 69 trillion molecules, we've been able to create these experimentally valid compounds that act as a control knob, or tool kit, that will guide us in developing new therapies," Mr. Frey said.\par \par \uc2 In the next 24 months, Mr. Frey said Deep Genomics expects to be able to generate a library of 1,000 molecule compounds that can be used in different ways, from in-house development of the company's own drugs to research collaborations and preclinical testing with pharmaceutical companies.\par \par \uc2 The 22-employee startup is packed with Ph.D.s from Cambridge, MIT, Stanford and Waterloo. Mr. Frey no longer teaches at the \uc2 University of Toronto\uc2 , but research on \b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and genetics under his leadership has been published in journals like Nature, Cell and Science.\par \par \uc2 Other companies using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to accelerate drug development include Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Notable Labs Inc.\par \par \uc2 Vinod Khosla\uc2 , whose firm led the Series A with a $9.8 million contribution, said Deep Genomics is notable for its level of expertise in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and for the type of drugs it is seeking to create.\par \par \uc2 "There are other AI companies out there trying to accelerate drug development, but Deep Genomics has the potential to open up an entirely new class of compounds not yet available," said Khosla. "This is an area of medicine the pharmaceutical industry really needs help with."\par \par \uc2 True Ventures\uc2 , which led the company's seed round in 2015, also returned to invest in this round, bringing Deep Genomics' total funding to date to nearly $17 million. The company plans to use the capital to continue building out the platform and explore strategic partnerships.\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Mack at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Heather.Mack@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heather.Mack@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170925ed9p0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Equifax Inc. Chief Executive \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  told a breakfast meeting in mid-August that data fraud is a "huge opportunity" for the credit-reporting company, allowing it to sell consumers more offerings.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith, who goes by Rick, said young people should sign up for the company's credit-monitoring offerings, according to a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZzqUnQg-Us"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 video recording of the meeting }}}\uc2  at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business. Mr. Smith was responding to an audience question about data fraud and said protecting consumer data was "a huge priority" for the company.\par \par \uc2 What the audience didn't know, and Mr. Smith didn't mention: less than three weeks earlier, \uc2 Equifax\uc2  had discovered a systems breach and called in \uc2 Mandiant\uc2 , the cyber-investigations division of \uc2 FireEye Inc\uc2 ., to investigate. That inquiry uncovered a massive attack that exposed vital personal information of potentially 143 million Americans, something \uc2 Equifax\uc2  didn't {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 announce until Sept. 7 }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith's remarks add to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/09/11/questions-about-equifax-breach-pile-up/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 questions from consumers, regulators and politicians }}}\uc2  about what \uc2 Equifax\uc2  knew, when it knew and whether it took sufficient steps to safeguard its data. They also underscore how focused Mr. Smith has been on getting and selling more data.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith and \uc2 Equifax\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Until the hack was announced, the drive for data had helped both Mr. Smith and \uc2 Equifax\uc2  prosper. After taking the helm of the company 12 years ago this week, Mr. Smith transformed \uc2 Equifax\uc2  from what he once described as a staid, slow-growing credit-reporting company into a data giant.\par \par \uc2 He bought companies with databases that contained information about consumers' employment histories, salaries and savings while also expanding internationally to places like Australia and India.\par \par \uc2 The result: by 2016, credit-reporting activities accounted for less than a third of revenues versus about 80% a decade earlier. \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's market value soared to nearly $18 billion, more than quadruple its value when Mr. Smith started.\par \par \uc2 And the executive became a business celebrity in \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's hometown of Atlanta, co-chairing the city's successful bid to host the 2019 Super Bowl and being inducted into Georgia State University's Business Hall of Fame in 2010. Mr. Smith also did well financially: Over his time as CEO, he took home around $127 million in combined total compensation, according to securities filings.\par \par \uc2 The breach upended it all. \uc2 Equifax\uc2  has faced heated criticism from angry consumers, politicians and its own customers. The company is under investigation by regulators even as the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  has faced heated criticism from angry consumers, politicians and its own customers. The company is under investigation by regulators even as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-looking-into-equifax-data-breach-1504902745"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 probes the hack }}}\uc2 . The stock market has cut its market value by $5.5 billion, or nearly a third.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith, meanwhile, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-ceo-to-testify-at-senate-hearing-on-data-breach-1506017076"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 will testify before Congress }}}\uc2  in coming weeks. He hasn't spoken publicly since the hack was disclosed, except for a video \uc2 Equifax\uc2  released at that time. In an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/09/12/equifax-ceo-we-make-changes-editorials-debates/659738001/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 article he wrote for USA Today }}}\uc2 , Mr. Smith said the incident was the "most humbling moment in our 118-year history."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  Wednesday night disclosed that it, too, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-discloses-edgar-corporate-filing-system-was-hacked-in-2016-1505956552"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 had been hacked }}}\uc2  last year, underscoring the vulnerability of a wide range of institutions. It also shows the gaps that often exist between when institutions discover an intrusion and when they disclose it.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  decided to hold off on immediately informing the public of its breach until the company had more clarity on the number of people affected and the types of information that were compromised, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith grew up in the Midwest. During high school summers, he built silos on farms. He graduated from \uc2 Purdue University\uc2  and was a varsity wrestler.\par \par \uc2 In the early 1980s, Mr. Smith landed at \uc2 General Electric\uc2  where he spent more than two decades moving up the ranks. Jack Welch, that company's well-known CEO, was a mentor.\par \par \uc2 People who worked with Mr. Smith describe him as being in constant motion, always focused on an objective and looking to move on.\par \par \uc2 He was the same outside the office. "He plays speed golf," said one person who knows him. "I never had a three putt with Rick. You putt once, and he gives you the second one because he's ready to go to the next hole."\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Smith came to \uc2 Equifax\uc2  he looked to change the company and its culture, he said in his University of Georgia remarks. "A lesson I always tell people is you have to take a risk in life," Mr. Smith said.\par \par \uc2 At the time, \uc2 Equifax\uc2  was focused primarily on selling credit data to lenders and "probably growing 1% or 2% organically a year," Mr. Smith said. "It wasn't a culture I wanted for the future, it was a culture of entitlement."\par \par \uc2 He added that he wanted to turn \uc2 Equifax\uc2  into a "global data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company." To do so, Mr. Smith acquired and monetized countless pieces of data on consumers' financial lives, allowing lenders, landlords and insurance companies, among others, to make decisions ranging from extending credit to hiring job seekers to renting an apartment. \uc2 Equifax\uc2  got that new data in part by buying other companies.\par \par \uc2 The company's biggest acquisition, in 2016, was the $1.9 billion {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumer-credit-agency-equifax-makes-move-on-australias-veda-1442546222"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 purchase of Veda Group Ltd. }}}\uc2 , an Australian credit information and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company.\par \par \uc2 The push into wider data sets turned \uc2 Equifax\uc2  into a business that housed "$12 trillion of consumer wealth data," Mr. Smith said in an interview with his alma mater around six years ago. "Without us, you wouldn't have global commerce as you know it today."\par \par \uc2 Besides work, Mr. Smith also was involved in outside boards and committees, several of which were focused on bettering the Atlanta region. "Rick wasn't a 12-hour a day, 7-day a week guy in the office," said a person who knows him.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Equifax\uc2  grew quickly, competitors privately criticized the company's technological abilities, saying it was more focused on growing data sets. \uc2 Equifax\uc2  "came to the software party very late," said an industry executive.\par \par \uc2 Following the breach, questions have arisen in information-security communities about whether and when \uc2 Equifax\uc2  patched a software vulnerability that gave hackers {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-entered-equifax-systems-in-march-1505943617"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 entry to the company's servers }}}\uc2 . \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , while saying its staff "took efforts" to patch systems when the vulnerability was reported in early March, acknowledged the questions and said its review "is ongoing."\par \par \uc2 The view that \uc2 Equifax\uc2  lagged behind peers technologically wasn't shared by Mr. Smith. We're a "world-class state-of-the art technology" company, he said at last month's University of Georgia event.\par \par \uc2 Robert McMillan contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com }}}\uc2  and Michael Rapoport at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com }}}\uc2  and Michael Rapoport at\par \par \uc2 RELATED\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-ceo-to-testify-at-senate-hearing-on-data-breach-1506017076"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Equifax CEO to Testify at Senate Hearing on Data Breach }}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-entered-equifax-systems-in-march-1505943617"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Hackers Entered Equifax Systems in March }}}\uc2  (Sept. 20)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weve-been-breached-inside-the-equifax-hack-1505693318"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 We've Been Breached: Inside Equifax's Hack }}}\uc2  (Sept. 18)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-work-for-government-shows-companys-broad-reach-1505781393"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Equifax's Government Work Shows Its Reach }}}\uc2  (Sept. 18)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-trade-commission-investigating-equifax-data-breach-1505400125"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Some Equifax Customers Who Sought Safety Got Burned }}}\uc2  (Sept. 14)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Equifax Reports Data Breach }}}\uc2  (Sept. 8)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170922ed9m00232\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Investors may be better positioned to safeguard their investments by participating in the loan.\par \par \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2 , \uc2 KKR\uc2  and \uc2 Vornado Realty Trust\uc2  took \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  private in a leveraged buyout in 2005 that left the company spending more than $400m a year to meet its debt burden while facing fierce competition from the likes of \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , Target and Amazon.\par \par \uc2 The debtor-in-possession financing is a type of funding used by companies in severe financial distress, typically ranking as the most senior obligation in a bankruptcy. It is also designed to help the retailer keep its 1,600 stores open as it restructures its debts after filing for bankruptcy protection on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The retailer's outstanding bonds and loans have plunged in value, highlighting how many investors expected it to stay afloat. Now owners of the bonds and loans are nursing losses, and based on current debt prices, will receive a hefty haircut on their holdings if the company emerges from Chapter 11 protection.\par \par \uc2 Bonds worth $400m that mature in 2018 briefly fell to 16 cents on the dollar this week before rebounding to trade at 28 cents yesterday. At the start of the month, the October 2018 notes were quoted just a few cents below par.\par \par \uc2 "This is a sign of where we are in the cycle," said Thomas Graff, the head of fixed income at Brown Advisory. "Folks are so desperate for interesting yield ideas. They were willing to assume that the 2018 bonds would be refinanced and you could get out at par, despite the really obvious challenges around the business."\par \par \uc2 Investors are paying close attention to a $1bn term loan, which included \uc2 Angelo Gordon\uc2 , \uc2 Franklin Templeton\uc2 , HPS Investment Partners and Marathon Asset Management, according to court documents. That loan, which is due in 2020, was quoted at 68 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, down from 78 cents earlier this month. Another term loan that matures in 2018, currently trades at 54 cents on the dollar.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Hazelton, the founder of the credit document \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group Street Diligence, characterised the toy retailer's capital structure as "extremely complicated". Guarantees between its US and foreign operations have muddied the water of who has first claim on any eventual payments \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  can make to its creditors.\par \par \uc2 The Gordian knot of inter-creditor agreements and intercompany loans has made "the actual pecking order . . . a bit of a mess," Mr Hazelton said. "The guarantee relationships, the intercompany debt outstanding, all of that is extremely complicated and will have a material effect on who gets what."\par \par \uc2 Despite the risk of owning \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  obligations, which rating agencies had flagged as speculative for years, the bonds and loans had mostly traded above distress territory. News that the company was considering plans to file for bankruptcy protection earlier this month set off a "dangerous game of dominoes" that quickly squeezed the group's liquidity, chief executive \uc2 David Brandon\uc2  claimed.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170926ed9l000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 's disclosure Wednesday of a 2016 cyberattack on its Edgar database drew criticism for both its timing and lack of detail, an awkward twist for a regulator that has been pushing public companies to both gird against attacks and to promptly disclose them.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2  said late Wednesday that Edgar, an electronic database of filings made by thousands of public companies, money managers and brokerage firms, was hacked last year. The \uc2 SEC\uc2  said it learned last month there may have been unspecified illegal trading related to the hack. The agency didn't disclose when the hack occurred, when it was detected and what information hackers accessed.\par \par \uc2 The response could undermine the agency's own efforts to push public companies to educate investors on cyberrisks and more swiftly disclose cyberbreaches to the public, said lawyers, investors and disclosure experts.\u8203\'20\'0B\par \par \uc2 "A federal governmental agency has a particular responsibility to be transparent," said former SEC Commissioner \uc2 Luis Aguilar\uc2 , who now works for a private-equity firm, Falcon Cyber Investments LLC., which invests in cybersecurity. "Particularly an agency that expects "full and fair disclosure" from publicly traded companies."\par \par \uc2 The delayed disclosure is also likely to tarnish the relationship between the regulator and the companies it oversees.\par \par \uc2 "Corporate America is going to be concerned. They have a deep-trust relationship with the \uc2 SEC\uc2 ," said Rob Blake, vice president of product management at Certent Inc., a Pleasanton, Calif. provider of disclosure management technologies. "They're going to ask some tough questions."\par \par \uc2 SEC Chairman \uc2 Jay Clayton\uc2 , a Trump appointee who joined the Commission in May, brought up the severity of cyberrisk in his first major speech in July.\par \par \uc2 "Public companies have a clear obligation to disclose material information about cyberrisks and cyberevents," he said at the time. "I expect them to take this requirement seriously."\par \par \uc2 Information about the \uc2 SEC\uc2  hack was buried in a lengthy statement by Mr. Clayton on the agency's cybersecurity efforts and released just after 8 p.m. on Wednesday evening.\par \par \uc2 There have been at least 123 breaches disclosed to the regulator by companies that file with the \uc2 SEC\uc2  since 2008, according to Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Many more hacks are made public directly to consumers each year through media reports and direct company outreach to affected parties.\par \par \uc2 Companies must report a cyberbreach to the \uc2 SEC\uc2  only if they judge it to be "material," meaning it is significant enough to influence an investor's decision to buy a company's stock. The rules for disclosing a hack are stricter for broker-dealers and investment advisers than they are for public companies.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2  has yet to bring a case against a company that was deemed to have failed to disclose a cyberincident, but officials haven't ruled out doing so.\par \par \uc2 "Can I envision circumstances where we would bring an action? Sure," said \uc2 Stephanie Avakian\uc2 , the SEC's deputy director of enforcement, at a February 2016 conference. "But it would have to be a significant disclosure failure to warrant that."\par \par \uc2 An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the news release and chairman's statement.\par \par \uc2 SEC staff also have pushed companies in recent years to loop in the regulator early in the discovery of any hack and to keep regional officers apprised of the internal investigation efforts to ensure any disclosures are made in a timely fashion.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2 's own cyber vulnerability has been part of regulatory discussion in recent years, including multiple remarks by Mr. Aguilar, the former SEC Commissioner.\par \par \uc2 "I saw the cybersecurity issues percolating on various fronts," said Mr. Aguilar in a Thursday email to The Wall Street Journal. "It's better to take precautionary measures sooner, rather than later."\par \par \uc2 The regulator also faces a different set of cyberrisks than public companies. The \uc2 SEC\uc2  has no public investors who could be harmed by the delayed disclosure. But the breach of Edgar could have led to hackers making illicit gains from insider trading, the \uc2 SEC\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 The Edgar hack occurred two years after Congress slashed half of the $50 million the \uc2 SEC\uc2  set aside for technology initiatives. The agency relies on Congress for its funding.\par \par \uc2 "The federal government is facing the same security challenges that corporations are facing in an environment where they are trying to compete for scarce security talent on a federal government budget," said \uc2 Heather Sussman\uc2 , co-lead of the privacy and cybersecurity practice at law firm \uc2 Ropes & Gray LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ezequiel Minaya and Kimberly S.

\par\par \uc2 Heard on the Street\par {\*\bkmkstart toc32}{\*\bkmkend toc32}\b \uc2 Is It Fintech Or Is It Insurance?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Anjani Trivedi \par \uc2 488 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 September 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)\par \uc2 AWSJ\par B1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 [Financial Analysis and Commentary]\par \par \uc2 The latest frontier in Chinese insurance: the internet. But investors are perhaps giving it too much faith.\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn Online Property & Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, is getting ready to raise as much as $1.5 billion in a Hong Kong public offering, valuing the company at a heady $11 billion. That makes it look more like the rare fintech "decacorn" from Silicon Valley, rather than a Chinese insurance company that sells drone-accident policies, among other products.\par \par \uc2 The lofty tech-like valuation is more a hat tip to ZhongAn's big backers than its own business. Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba's \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2  and Tencent own nearly 30% of the company and will end up with just more than 20% after it goes public. The latest entrant is Japan's SoftBank, coming in as a cornerstone investor to take up more than 36% of the offered shares at the top end of the price range. Meanwhile, Chinese insurance behemoth Ping An holds about 12%. Only a thin slice will be given out to the public.\par \par \uc2 ZhongAn brings little to the table except the novelty value of an online-only insurer. For one, almost 70% of insurance is already sold online in China. It boasts a cloud-based system that can process up to 13,000 policies a second and an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -based customer service chatbot. It sells policies like a Shipping Return Policy -- its top product -- which covers the shipping cost on returns of purchases. Buyers pay a premium of 0.20 to 9.9 yuan (US$0.03 to US$1.50) per purchase.\par \par \uc2 Other products include travel insurance, along with policies for diabetes patients, cracked phone screens and damaged furniture. Last year, ZhongAn sold just more than 10 policies per customer. So it is essentially a bet on high volume in the everyday insurance-bundling business, with more than 90% of sales generated from its partner platforms -- such as \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2 , China's largest travel site, Ctrip, and Uber rival \uc2 Didi Chuxing\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But these partnerships come at a cost: ZhongAn posted net written premium income of 886 million yuan in the first quarter, up 55% from a year earlier. But given substantial expenses including fees to its partners -- more than a third of net premiums -- it ended up posting a loss of 202 million yuan for the first quarter of this year. The company said it expects to post a big loss for the full year.\par \par \uc2 At the top of its IPO pricing range, ZhongAn would be valued at more than 4 times book value, meaning all upside seems to have been priced in. Classic property-and-casualty insurers like PICC trade closer to 1.4 times book value.\par \par \uc2 This trip to the frontier is already looking expensive.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170920000050"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170920ed9l00011\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Investors were already expecting deep haircuts as the commonwealth makes its way through a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/president-obama-signs-puerto-rico-debt-relief-bill-1467321998"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  federally supervised restructuring process }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "How long will they be missing revenues because of people not getting power?" asked Dan Solender, director of municipals at \uc2 Lord Abbett & Co\uc2 . which holds more than $100 million of Puerto Rico bonds, including some from the power authority.\par \par \uc2 Even before Hurricane {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-maria-slams-into-puerto-rico-1505907575"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Maria slammed into Puerto Rico  }}}\uc2 early Wednesday, thousands of people had been without electricity for two weeks, since Hurricane Irma passed by the island's northern coast. But the damage from Maria, the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928, is likely to be much more widespread on the island, which is already reeling from a decade of economic distress.\par \par \uc2 Puerto Rico owes roughly $70 billion to investors, including individuals on both the island and the mainland, to major U.S. mutual funds and, increasingly, to hedge funds. \uc2 OppenheimerFunds Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Franklin Resources Inc\uc2 . are the biggest mutual fund holders of Puerto Rico bonds, according to \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  Direct.\par \par \uc2 Depending on the extent of the damage, the hurricane could factor into future decisions by the federal control board on just how much those investors will get paid, said \uc2 Matt Fabian\uc2 , a partner with Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the aftermath of a natural disaster, "why would a court decide 'yes, investors, you should take more money off the island?'" Mr. Fabian asked.\par \par \uc2 But some analysts and advisers to Puerto Rico bondholders also said Wednesday that a massive hurricane recovery effort could help stimulate economic growth on the island. Federal disaster relief funds and insurance money flowing into Puerto Rico could replace outdated infrastructure, and rebuilding could help put people to work, these people said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Gillers at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:heather.gillers@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 heather.gillers@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170920ed9k0063h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Investors may be better positioned to safeguard their investments by participating in the loan.\par \par \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2 , \uc2 KKR\uc2  and \uc2 Vornado Realty Trust\uc2  took \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  private in a leveraged buyout in 2005, which left the company spending more than $400m a year meeting its debt burden while facing fierce competition from the likes of \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , Target and Amazon.\par \par \uc2 The debtor-in-possession financing is a type of funding used by companies in severe financial distress, typically ranking as the most senior obligation in a bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 It is also designed to help the retailer keep its 1,600 stores open as it restructures its debts following its filing for bankruptcy protection on Monday.\par \par \uc2 The retailer\u8217\'20\'19s outstanding bonds and loans have plunged in value, highlighting how many investors expected the embattled vendor of toys to stay afloat.\par \par \uc2 Now owners of the bonds and loans are nursing losses, and based on current debt prices, will receive a hefty haircut on their holdings if the company emerges from Chapter 11 protection.\par \par \uc2 Bonds worth $400m that mature in 2018 briefly fell to 16 cents on the dollar earlier this week before rebounding to trade at 28 cents on Wednesday. At the start of the month, the October 2018 notes were quoted just a few cents below par.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a sign of where we are in the cycle,\u8221\'20\'1D said Thomas Graff, the head of fixed income at Brown Advisory. \u8220\'20\'1CFolks are so desperate for interesting yield ideas. They were willing to assume that the 2018 bonds would be refinanced and you could get out at par, despite the really obvious challenges around the business.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Investors are paying close attention to a $1bn term loan, which included \uc2 Angelo Gordon\uc2 , \uc2 Franklin Templeton\uc2 , HPS Investment Partners and Marathon Asset Management as investors, according to court documents.\par \par \uc2 That loan, which is due in 2020, was quoted at 68 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, down from 78 cents earlier this month. Another term loan that matures in 2018, currently trades at 54 cents on the dollar.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Hazelton, the founder of the credit document \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group Street Diligence, characterised the toy retailer\u8217\'20\'19s capital structure as \u8220\'20\'1Cextremely complicated\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Guarantees between its US and foreign operations have muddied the water of who has first claim on any eventual payments \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  is able to make to its creditors.\par \par \uc2 The Gordian knot of inter-creditor agreements and intercompany loans has made \u8220\'20\'1Cthe actual pecking order\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09a bit of a mess\u8221\'20\'1D, Mr Hazelton said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe guarantee relationships, the intercompany debt outstanding, all of that is extremely complicated and will have a material effect on who gets what.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The backstory\par \par \uc2 Highlights of the FT\u8217\'20\'19s coverage of how online shopping is disrupting the US retail sector\par \par \uc2 * FT Series: Retail\u8217\'20\'19s clearance sale\par \par \uc2 * Charting the US retail revolution\par \par \uc2 * FT View: Bricks and mortar over straw\par \par \uc2 * Retailers to Amazon: pick me, pick me\par \par \uc2 * Will the death of retail be the next big short?\par \par \uc2 Despite the risk of owning \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  obligations, which rating agencies had flagged as speculative for years, the bonds and loans had mostly traded above distress territory.\par \par \uc2 News that the company was considering plans to file for bankruptcy protection earlier this month set off a \u8220\'20\'1Cdangerous game of dominoes\u8221\'20\'1D that quickly squeezed the group\u8217\'20\'19s liquidity, chief executive \uc2 David Brandon\uc2  claimed.\par \par \uc2 Fitch, S&P Global and \uc2 Moody\u8217\'20\'19s\uc2  have since downgraded \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  to reflect the bankruptcy filing, and distressed investors are likely to spend the coming days parsing through credit documents to decide if the loans have dropped below expected recovery values.\par \par \uc2 But not all investors are convinced that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is the right course for the retailer that brought the jingle \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t want to grow up, I\u8217\'20\'19m a \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  kid\u8221\'20\'1D and Geoffrey the Giraffe into homes across the US.\par \par \uc2 John Lekas, chief executive and senior portfolio manager of Leader Capital, said he believed liquidation was more prudent and that the value of the company would continue to erode if executives tried to invest further in the business.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe [\uc2 Toys R Us\uc2 ] structure is complicated because they have been screwing around [with] this for 10 years. It is not working and it hasn\u8217\'20\'19t worked for a long time,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Lekas said. \u8220\'20\'1CI just don\u8217\'20\'19t understand why they are doing Chapter 11 to try and revive a dead business? Why? It\u8217\'20\'19s dead. Why are you putting the electric shocker on it?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020171015ed9k002ut\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Dr Yin, one of Taiwan\u8217\'20\'19s richest men, remains Gogoro\u8217\'20\'19s biggest shareholder. Mr Luke would not disclose the level of specific equity holdings.\par \par \uc2 Much of the new capital raised will be targeted at expanding the battery network and developing the technology in the back-end system, which uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to respond to battery usage and demand as well as electricity pricing in real-time.\par \par \uc2 Mr Luke, who had a close hand in developing \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Xbox and HTC\u8217\'20\'19s smartphones, said that Gogoro built the first two models of its scooter \u8220\'20\'1Cout of necessity\u8221\'20\'1D to prove the cost-effectiveness of making vehicles that can use its batteries and charging system.\par \par \uc2 The company now sees itself becoming more of an energy utility, offering city-wide battery storage and feeding back into the power grid if needed, rather than a scooter manufacturer.\par \par \uc2 Gogoro is already in talks with vehicle manufacturers outside of Taiwan about making \u8220\'20\'1Csmart scooters\u8221\'20\'1D that can use the company\u8217\'20\'19s battery and \u8220\'20\'1Crefuelling infrastructure\u8221\'20\'1D, Mr Luke said.\par \par \uc2 Since 2015, Gogoro has installed more than 400 battery swapping stations, mostly in Taipei, but also other Taiwanese cities, and via scooter-sharing in Berlin and Paris. While growth has to-date been targeted on its home turf as well as higher-end European cities, its longer-term focus will likely be in large Asian cities, like Taipei, which face macro issues of high fuel prices, pollution, congestion, constrained or defunct public transport, and existing two-wheel vehicle density.\par \par \uc2 Gogoro\u8217\'20\'19s raising of $300m is significant for Taiwan\u8217\'20\'19s fledgling startup scene, which at times struggles to gain attention in the shadow of the Chinese market.\par \par \uc2 Yuanta Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who is based in Taipei, says despite short-term pressure on tech stocks, in the longer-term Taiwan should be an attractive area for foreign institutional investors with higher yields and cheaper valuations than China, US and South Korea.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170919ed9j0099d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

As the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  meets this week, officials are flummoxed by low levels of price growth. By Sam Fleming\par \par \uc2 Ron Paul, at least, has no regrets. The former Texas congressman is one of the most prominent voices among those Americans who have long been deeply suspicious of the US central bank and its power to print money. When he ran for president in 2012, he assailed then Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke for debasing the currency and risking an inflationary upsurge by pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.\par \par \uc2 "We don't have prices in the consumer market going up like in the 1970s but we should not be surprised if that happens," says Mr Paul, who once brandished a silver coin as he lectured the former Fed chair on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, certainty is harder to come by. As the Fed meets in Washington tomorrow, US central bankers, and their counterparts across the world, are genuinely flummoxed by recent low inflation readings.\par \par \uc2 Despite a recovery that is now the third-longest on record, America is trapped not in a 1970s-style, double-digit inflationary upsurge, but a slow-inflation quandary. Price growth jumped in August , driven by energy and accommodation prices, yet investors still doubt inflation will be strong enough to merit more than a couple of interest-rate rises before the end of 2018.\par \par \uc2 The uncertain outlook has confounded Fed policymakers just as the central bank prepares for a leadership overhaul in the new year. President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 , who will decide shortly on the replacement for current Fed chair \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  , has managed to be on both sides of the question - slamming low rates last year during the election but welcoming them this year.\par \par \uc2 "It is a puzzle and raises a real question what the Fed should do next; I would have thought we would have been seeing more inflation pressures by now," says Jon Faust, a former adviser to Ms Yellen at the Fed now at \uc2 Johns Hopkins University\uc2 . "At a time when there is a confusing economic picture we don't know who will be judging that picture in a few months' time at the Fed. That added uncertainty is not a good thing."\par \par \uc2 Having lifted rates twice this year in the face of this dreary inflation, the Fed is expected to keep the target range for its key rate at 1-1.25 per cent on Wednesday, even as it announces the gradual unwinding of its quantitative easing programme . Ms Yellen is likely to leave open the prospect of a further rate rise in December, as she banks on diminishing slack in the economy driving up prices amid a global growth rebound.\par \par \uc2 Yet the Fed's 2 per cent inflation target still appears out of reach - stripping out food and energy costs, it has not attained that rate for half a decade. It has been a quarter of a century since the Fed's favoured measure of inflation - personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy - last punched up above the still relatively sedate level of 3 per cent. It was just 1.4 per cent in the year to July. Wage growth , meanwhile, remains well below its pre-crisis pace at just 2.5 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Tools for the next downturn\par \par \uc2 In 2015 Ms Yellen set out a clear road map to higher goods and services inflation, making the traditional central bankers' argument that diminishing spare capacity would ultimately stoke up price and wage pressures. The trouble is that even as the economy grows steadily and joblessness falls to 4.4 per cent , inflation has this year undershot the levels suggested by her model.\par \par \uc2 Part of the problem is that the link between low unemployment and higher price growth embodied in the so-called Phillips curve has looked fragile for decades. Some officials suspect the Fed can afford an even stronger labour market without worrying about excessive price growth.\par \par \uc2 On one level, sluggish inflation combined with respectable growth is far from a bad thing - central bankers in the 1970s would have looked on the current paradigm with envy. But if inflation hovers too low it leaves the economy uncomfortably close to deflation and could damage the credibility of an institution that is meant to target 2 per cent inflation. Low rates and low inflation leave little rate-cutting firepower when the next downturn strikes.\par \par \uc2 Weak inflation may also prompt the central bank to leave policy so loose that it inadvertently stokes up a cycle of boom and bust - something the Fed has repeatedly been accused of doing in recent decades. That worry has reasserted itself thanks to soaring asset valuations . "The risk is that you are going to end up with interest rates that are too low relative to what is consistent with financial and macroeconomic stability," says \uc2 Claudio Borio\uc2 , head of the monetary and economic department at the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2 . "If inflation doesn't show up, it will be hard to move interest rates up at the right speed to address this issue."\par \par \uc2 A five-month-long string of weak figures this year has prompted some Fed policymakers, including \uc2 Bill Dudley\uc2  of the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  and Rob Kaplan of the Dallas Fed, to start asking searching questions. Are globalisation and technological advances restraining inflation at a time when a cyclical pick-up might otherwise drive it higher?\par \par \uc2 "These two forces are colliding," Mr Kaplan told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  last month. "The cyclical forces we have understood historically; the structural forces are somewhat new, particularly technology-enabled disruption."\par \par \uc2 Some policymakers cite the increased ease with which shoppers can compare prices on the internet and the impact these changes have on brand loyalty and pricing power. \uc2 Amazon\uc2  is entering grocery retail via \uc2 Whole Foods\uc2  , while the hotel sector is being overturned by \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 . \uc2 Rick Rieder\uc2 , chief investment officer of fixed income at \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , sees more price disruption to come, as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  promises to further transform some industries.\par \par \uc2 Research from Adobe \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  shows what online competition is doing in some fields. Online prices of furniture and bedding are down 8.3 per cent over the past two years, whereas the equivalent category in the consumer price index, which includes offline sales, has dropped less than half that amount. Sporting goods prices online are down 10 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in the CPI. Online clothing prices are down 6.5 per cent in the same period, compared with a 4.1 per cent offline drop.\par \par \uc2 Goods price deflation is not new in the US, and Pete Klenow of \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  says comparisons between online and offline prices baskets can be tricky because of their different constructions. While some Fed officials argue that technology is eroding companies' ability to lift prices, \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  analysts recently found an increase in corporate pricing power over the past 20 years, consistent with a rise in profit margins and industry concentration.\par \par \uc2 Goldman economists also question arguments that ecommerce, which accounts for around 8 per cent of retail sales - is having an appreciable impact on broader inflation. The effects of online competition on traditional retailers' pricing may be no larger than those seen during the rise of "big box" superstore chains like \uc2 Walmart\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other analysts have been looking closely at the labour market, linking paltry wage growth to the soggy inflation readings. Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the OECD, the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations, says higher job insecurity and lower labour force mobility in the US may be stifling calls for higher wages. "Workers and producers are unsure that the market is actually going to be robust enough to support higher wage and price demands."\par \par \uc2 While goods price inflation has been negative for much of the post-crisis period, Ms Mann highlights a weakening in services price inflation from 3 per cent before the crisis to closer to 2 per cent now. She is examining the growing role of services jobs held disproportionately by women who are paid less than men. "It is really tough to get inflation up if wages are not rising," she says.\par \par \uc2 Official confusion\par \par \uc2 At the Fed, some officials struggle to see why big structural factors would have intervened to crush inflation numbers. Instead, the Fed has suggested this year's dull outcomes are being driven by a series of coincidental, one-off drags, including a fall in wireless data prices.\par \par \uc2 If they are right, the jump in inflation last month could herald further gains - with an extra lift potentially from the recent dollar depreciation. Yet Fed rate-setters are split over the outlook, and market confidence in Fed forecasts has ebbed. \uc2 Charles Plosser\uc2 , a former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, says: "I do think economists need to work harder on understanding the inflation process."\par \par \uc2 The shortfalls are by no means confined to the US. In the euro area, a sharp drop in unemployment across the region is yet to be matched by a strong pick-up in wages - without which officials fear inflation will fail to hit its goal of just under 2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Mario Draghi\uc2 , president of the European Central Bank, said this year that "backward-looking" negotiation of nominal wages that reference low inflation rates may be restraining prices. Many of the new jobs are also in temporary or part-time employment, which may slow the growth of nominal wages as well. At the \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2 , meanwhile, officials' struggles with achieving inflation targets are well documented.\par \par \uc2 In the US, whose monetary policy has global reach, questions about inflation are compounded by the uncertainty over who will call the shots from February. Mr Trump will have the opportunity to appoint up to five new Fed board members by next year, but attempting to predict his choices seems futile given the capricious nature of his personnel decisions.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts argue that the central bank could end up drifting in a hawkish direction - which would worry economists with a firm eye on low inflation. Mr Trump may not reappoint Ms Yellen, who inhabits the dovish end of the policy spectrum. A number of the alternative candidates for chair have shown signs of more hawkish leanings - among them the Stanford academics \uc2 Kevin Warsh\uc2  and John Taylor.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, Mr Trump has called himself a " low-rates person " and there are precedents for presidents leaning on Fed leadership to keep policy loose - even when inflation threatens to start to pick up. \uc2 Richard Nixon\uc2  pressured Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the early 1970s, for example. While an inflationary upsurge may currently seem unlikely, economists have such a thin grasp on what drives inflation that it is far from impossible - as observers including Mr Paul continue to warn.\par \par \uc2 If inflation fails to reassert itself, the Fed and other central banks will find it harder to balance the need for low rates against the hazardous side-effects loose policy engenders in markets. Mr Faust says: "If the central bank keeps pushing it can make inflation go up - but the question is whether some other excess bubbles up first."\par \par \uc2 The low-inflation enigma looks set to continue bedevilling policy not only in the US but across the world.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Claire Jones in Frankfurt\par \par \uc2 Brexit effect\par \par \uc2 Pound's depreciation feeds into rising prices\par \par \uc2 Unlike the US, the UK is witnessing a burst of inflation that is causing a dilemma for the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  . But the reasons have little to do with low interest rates and quantitative easing and much more to do with Brexit .\par \par \uc2 Inflation in the UK, like that in the US and across the eurozone, had been firmly stuck below the BoE's 2 per cent target until the British public voted to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2  in June 2016; inflation hit a low of -0.1 per cent in September 2015. But the depreciation of the pound since the vote last year has pushed up the price of imported products, which has fed through into consumer prices. The trade-weighted sterling exchange rate has fallen by 11 per cent since the referendum and had dropped by as much as 16 per cent at its lowest point in mid-October last year.\par \par \uc2 This helped push inflation to a five-year high of 2.9 per cent in August, with many analysts predicting it will continue to move higher over the next few months and peak somewhere at or above 3 per cent towards the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 Many businesses had taken out currency hedges to cushion the impact of a fall in the value of sterling last year. But most of these hedges were for no more than 12 months, meaning the fall in the pound has gradually been felt by companies in the cost of imported goods and passed on to consumers. A pick-up in oil and other commodity prices has also boosted inflation.\par \par \uc2 But there is little sign that the depreciation-driven inflation is leading to any pick-up in domestically generated price rises.\par \par \uc2 Wage growth has remained subdued and the rate of growth of prices for services has not accelerated over the past year. And with sterling rising in recent weeks, some of the inflationary pressure from the currency could also dissipate.\par \par \uc2 Gemma Tetlow\par \par \uc2 Speed read\par \par \uc2 Jobs jolt Some say the Fed can afford an even hotter labour market without worrying about excessive price growth\par \par \uc2 Latest disrupter The effects of online competition on prices may be no larger than the rise of big stores like \uc2 Walmart\par \par \uc2 Perils of price rises Officials will find it hard to balance low rates against the impact of loose policy in asset markets\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170919ed9j0000o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

But investors are right to focus on the chip maker's more tangible opportunities.\par \par \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's graphics processor chips, already widely used in gaming PCs, have also proven popular for "mining" cryptocurrencies such as ethereum. Surging prices for ethereum and bitcoin over the summer led to a jump in orders for graphic chip cards that gave a $150 million boost to \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidias-cloud-still-has-a-big-silver-lining-1502471482"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reported revenue for the quarter}}}\uc2  ended July 30\u8212\'20\'14amounting to nearly 7% of total sales for the period.\par \par \uc2 But cryptocurrency is a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-wild-ride-shows-the-truth-it-is-probably-worth-zero-1505760623"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 highly volatile space}}}\uc2 .

Prices on ethereum and bitcoin slumped 45% and 26% respectively in the first two weeks of September, according to data from CoinDesk.\par \par \uc2 That would appear to pose at least some risk for \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 , particularly after the stock's record gains in the last two years and its 80% rally since early May. \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  now trades at more than 52 times forward earnings\u8212\'20\'14one of the highest multiples in semiconductors.\par \par \uc2 But most of that run-up can be credited to the company's success in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Graphics chips play a vital role in this technology and are enjoying a boom in demand driven by data centers and self-driving cars. \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's data center business has nearly tripled in size over the last year. Vivek Arya of \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2  projects this segment will total nearly $4 billion in revenue by fiscal 2020\u8212\'20\'14more than double its size now. When it comes to \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 , real money always beats the virtual kind.\par \par \uc2 Write to \uc2 Dan Gallagher\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:dan.gallagher@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dan.gallagher@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170919ed9j00461\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It can also make follow-on investments in later-stage deals.\par \par \uc2 Many of the Engine's companies will be housed in the firm's 26,000 square foot space in Cambridge. The startups can get access to MIT's specialized equipment, labs and advice, said Katie Rae, chief executive and managing partner of the Engine, who previously was managing director of Techstars Boston.\par \par \uc2 "Our mission is to back and support \u8216\'20\'18tough tech' companies that solve problems," Ms. Rae said.

Brad Powell, managing director of investments for \uc2 Emerson Collective\uc2 ; and Sue Siegel, chief executive of GE Ventures.\par \par \uc2 Many of its startups come out of MIT, but the firm said it would also look beyond campus for other opportunities.\par \par \uc2 So far the Engine has made seven investments such as iSee, an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  startup for autonomous vehicles and other uses; Baseload Renewables, a low-cost energy storage company for renewable energy; and Kytopen, which aims to speed the genetic engineering of cells.\par \par \uc2 Write to Tomio Geron at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:tomio.geron@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tomio.geron@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170919ed9j0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

A look at biometrics, behavioral monitoring and more\b0\par\par\uc2 By Steven Norton \par \uc2 1,055 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2017\par 03:04\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Cybersecurity\par \uc2 RSTPROCY\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 What will life after passwords look like?\par \par \uc2 For many companies, the goal is for the authentication of customer and employee identities to be nearly invisible, taking only a second as a shopper logs into the website, or running in the background as office staff do their work.\par \par \uc2 To achieve that, and be able to accurately verify that employees and customers are who they say they are, companies are embracing new technologies\u8212\'20\'14including biometric scans of faces and fingerprints, and behavioral-monitoring systems that track such activities as what apps you open most frequently.\par \par \uc2 As hackers are getting more sophisticated, traditional passwords are starting to be seen as less secure. The recent data breach of credit-reporting agency \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . is likely to raise further questions about using Social Security numbers and other personal data to authenticate a person's identity, and to fuel the push for better authentication methods. While security is paramount, companies are also seeking to provide a seamless experience to employees and customers who don't want to be burdened with multiple passcodes.\par \par \uc2 Mastercard Inc\uc2 . is equipping some of its employees with laptops that have built-in fingerprint readers, and is testing technology that scans employees' faces before allowing them inside an office building. Exploring another advanced capability, \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  in March acquired NuData, whose technology can recognize customers based on how they hold their phone and other behavioral biometrics.\par \par \uc2 "The driving force is the elimination of passwords," says Ron Green, Mastercard's chief security officer.\par \par \uc2 Companies walk a thin line as they work to improve security without disrupting the user experience. Some customers may perceive their data as less secure if a password isn't required. But if behavior-based programs are too sensitive and act on a false positive, such as blocking access for a user who types differently due to a broken finger, that is cumbersome, too.\par \par \uc2 Similar challenges apply to facial recognition, even as the technology continues to improve, says Steve Wilson, who researches digital-identity issues as vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research, a Silicon Valley-based firm that advises companies about disruptive technologies. A poorly lighted room or a day without shaving, for example, could keep a person from being able to access an application, Mr. Wilson says.\par \par \uc2 Like any authentication measure, such tools also remain susceptible to spoofing by hackers. A high-quality photo or animation, or in some cases an animated avatar, can fool some facial-recognition systems.\par \par \uc2 "It's an arms race between biometric designers and the criminals that are trying to fool the systems," Mr. Wilson says.\par \par \uc2 Companies are coming up with creative ways to combat the problem. \uc2 Vasco Data Security International Inc\uc2 ., a maker of cybersecurity technologies, uses "liveness detection" technology which asks users to blink their eyes or turn their heads to verify that they're a living being, says David Vergara, the company's head of global product marketing.\par \par \uc2 Despite their limitations, biometric authentication measures such as facial recognition continue to become more mainstream. Indeed, \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . has said facial recognition will be used as the primary way to unlock its latest smartphone, the iPhone X, which could significantly popularize the technology.\par \par \uc2 A number of firms are turning to technology powered by \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to constantly authenticate people as they use an app. Such measures, which are largely behavior-based and look at a person's typical patterns of technology use, are relatively new, but corporate interest is high, says Forrester Research analyst Andras Cser.\par \par \uc2 Automatically analyzing users' behavioral patterns, which can include hundreds of disparate data points such as typing speed, is the Holy Grail for authentication, Mr. Vergara says, because it allows firms to monitor security in real time rather than relying on a one-time password.\par \par \uc2 Behavior-based authentication is focusing on consumers first, Mr. Vergara adds, because of the potential to improve the user experience, and therefore a company's bottom line.\par \par \uc2 Health insurer Aetna Inc. is rolling out behavior-based security measures for its mobile and web applications, which also will include options for biometric factors such as fingerprint swipes. The technology collects the attributes of \uc2 Aetna\uc2  members, such as how they move through an application or how quickly they type, and feeds that data into a risk engine. Based on data about a customer's behavior on the app and what device he or she is using, the engine can create a picture of "normal" behavior in about two weeks.\par \par \uc2 Then, if someone's actions deviate significantly from their typical behavior, the system takes note. If a customer gives her phone to a friend, for example, the app may recognize the friend as a different person and ask for another form of authentication, such as a finger swipe across the screen.\par \par \uc2 Voice is currently the hot area for startups, says Mr. Wilson. There are voice-identification systems that can learn and verify speech cadence, accent and pronunciation, and other factors to create a unique "voiceprint." Some companies are building algorithms that use voice to determine contextual clues, such as whether the speaker is under duress.\par \par \uc2 Other biometric authentication measures being developed or explored include tools that recognize handwriting, scanners that authenticate users based on their ear shape, and even ID markers obtained through a person's DNA. No matter what forms future authentication methods take, Mr. Wilson observes, "what really matters is getting a biometric that consumers can use."\par \par \uc2 Companies shouldn't rely on a single authentication tool, analysts say. Experts recommend taking a layered approach to security, one that uses a combination of biometrics, behavior monitoring and, yes, even passwords.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Norton is a reporter for CIO Journal in New York.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc44}{\*\bkmkend toc44}\b \uc2 Nobody seems to know why there\u8217\'20\'19s no US inflation\b0\par\par\uc2 Sam Fleming in Washington \par \uc2 2,287 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2017\par 19:22\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

The former Texas Congressman is one of the most prominent voices among those Americans who have long been deeply suspicious of the US central bank and its power to print money. When he ran for president in 2012, he assailed then Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke for debasing the currency and risking an inflationary upsurge by pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t have prices in the consumer market going up like in the 1970s but we should not be surprised if that happens,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Paul, who once brandished a silver coin as he lectured the former Fed chair on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, certainty is harder to come by. As the Fed meets in Washington tomorrow, US central bankers, and their counterparts across the world, are genuinely flummoxed by recent low inflation readings.\par \par \uc2 Despite a recovery that is now the third-longest on record, America is trapped not in a 1970s-style, double-digit inflationary upsurge, but a slow-inflation quandary. Price growth jumped in August, driven by energy and accommodation prices, yet investors still doubt inflation will be strong enough to merit more than a couple of interest-rate rises before the end of 2018.\par \par \uc2 The uncertain outlook has confounded Fed policymakers just as the central bank prepares for a leadership overhaul in the new year. President Donald Trump, who will decide shortly on the replacement for current Fed chair \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2 , has managed to be on both sides of the question \u8212\'20\'14 slamming low rates last year during the election but welcoming them this year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is a puzzle and raises a real question what the Fed should do next; I would have thought we would have been seeing more inflation pressures by now,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jon Faust, a former adviser to Ms Yellen at the Fed now at \uc2 Johns Hopkins University\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CAt a time when there is a confusing economic picture we don\u8217\'20\'19t know who will be judging that picture in a few months\u8217\'20\'19 time at the Fed. That added uncertainty is not a good thing.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Having lifted rates twice this year in the face of this dreary inflation, the Fed is expected to keep the target range for its key rate at 1-1.25 per cent on Wednesday, even as it announces the gradual unwinding of its quantitative easing programme. Ms Yellen is likely to leave open the prospect of a further rate rise in December, as she banks on diminishing slack in the economy driving up prices amid a global growth rebound.\par \par \uc2 Yet the Fed\u8217\'20\'19s 2 per cent inflation target still appears out of reach \u8212\'20\'14 stripping out food and energy costs, it has not attained that rate for half a decade. It has been a quarter of a century since the Fed\u8217\'20\'19s favoured measure of inflation \u8212\'20\'14 personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy \u8212\'20\'14 last punched up above the still relatively sedate level of 3 per cent. It was just 1.4 per cent in the year to July. Wage growth, meanwhile, remains well below its pre-crisis pace at just 2.5 per cent.\par \par \uc2 In 2015 Ms Yellen set out a clear road map to higher goods and services inflation, making the traditional central bankers\u8217\'20\'19 argument that diminishing spare capacity would ultimately stoke up price and wage pressures. The trouble is that even as the economy grows steadily and joblessness falls to 4.4 per cent, inflation has this year undershot the levels suggested by her model.\par \par \uc2 Part of the problem is that the link between low unemployment and higher price growth embodied in the so-called Phillips curve has looked fragile for decades. Some officials suspect the Fed can afford an even stronger labour market without worrying about excessive price growth.\par \par \uc2 On one level, sluggish inflation combined with respectable growth is far from a bad thing \u8212\'20\'14 central bankers in the 1970s would have looked on the current paradigm with envy. But if inflation hovers too low it leaves the economy uncomfortably close to deflation and could damage the credibility of an institution that is meant to target 2 per cent inflation. Low rates and low inflation leave little rate-cutting firepower when the next downturn strikes.\par \par \uc2 Fed chair: two hawkish contenders\par \par \uc2 Kevin Warsh\par \par \uc2 A former Fed governor currently at Stanford, he has called for reform of the central bank and has endorsed Donald Trump\u8217\'20\'19s goal of a 3% growth rate.\par \par \uc2 John Taylor\par \par \uc2 Also a Stanford economist who served in the George W Bush administration, he co-wrote a paper with Mr Warsh on the 3% growth target.\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 Weak inflation may also prompt the central bank to leave policy so loose that it inadvertently stokes up a cycle of boom and bust \u8212\'20\'14 something the Fed has repeatedly been accused of doing in recent decades. That worry has reasserted itself thanks to soaring asset valuations. \u8220\'20\'1CThe risk is that you are going to end up with interest rates that are too low relative to what is consistent with financial and macroeconomic stability,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Claudio Borio\uc2 , head of the monetary and economic department at the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CIf inflation doesn\u8217\'20\'19t show up, it will be hard to move interest rates up at the right speed to address this issue.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A five-month-long string of weak figures this year has prompted some Fed policymakers, including \uc2 Bill Dudley\uc2  of the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  and Rob Kaplan of the Dallas Fed, to start asking searching questions. Are globalisation and technological advances restraining inflation at a time when a cyclical pick-up might otherwise drive it higher?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese two forces are colliding,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Kaplan told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  last month. \u8220\'20\'1CThe cyclical forces we have understood historically; the structural forces are somewhat new, particularly technology-enabled disruption.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Some policymakers cite the increased ease with which shoppers can compare prices on the internet and the impact these changes have on brand loyalty and pricing power. \uc2 Amazon\uc2  is entering grocery retail via \uc2 Whole Foods\uc2 , while the hotel sector is being overturned by \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 . \uc2 Rick Rieder\uc2 , chief investment officer of fixed income at \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , sees more price disruption to come, as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  promises to further transform some industries.\par \par \uc2 Research from Adobe \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  shows what online competition is doing in some fields. Online prices of furniture and bedding are down 8.3 per cent over the past two years, whereas the equivalent category in the consumer price index, which includes offline sales, has dropped less than half that amount. Sporting goods prices online are down 10 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in the CPI. Online clothing prices are down 6.5 per cent in the same period, compared with a 4.1 per cent offline drop.\par \par \uc2 Goods price deflation is not new in the US, and Pete Klenow of \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  says comparisons between online and offline prices baskets can be tricky because of their different constructions. While some Fed officials argue that technology is eroding companies\u8217\'20\'19 ability to lift prices, \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  analysts recently found an increase in corporate pricing power over the past 20 years, consistent with a rise in profit margins and industry concentration.\par \par \uc2 Goldman economists also question arguments that ecommerce, which accounts for around 8 per cent of retail sales \u8212\'20\'14 is having an appreciable impact on broader inflation. The effects of online competition on traditional retailers\u8217\'20\'19 pricing may be no larger than those seen during the rise of \u8220\'20\'1Cbig box\u8221\'20\'1D superstore chains like \uc2 Walmart\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other analysts have been looking closely at the labour market, linking paltry wage growth to the soggy inflation readings. Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the OECD, the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations, says higher job insecurity and lower labour force mobility in the US may be stifling calls for higher wages. \u8220\'20\'1CWorkers and producers are unsure that the market is actually going to be robust enough to support higher wage and price demands.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 While goods price inflation has been negative for much of the post-crisis period, Ms Mann highlights a weakening in services price inflation from 3 per cent before the crisis to closer to 2 per cent now. She is examining the growing role of services jobs held disproportionately by women who are paid less than men. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is really tough to get inflation up if wages are not rising,\u8221\'20\'1D she says.\par \par \uc2 At the Fed, some officials struggle to see why big structural factors would have intervened to crush inflation numbers. Instead, the Fed has suggested this year\u8217\'20\'19s dull outcomes are being driven by a series of coincidental, one-off drags, including a fall in wireless data prices.\par \par \uc2 If they are right, the jump in inflation last month could herald further gains \u8212\'20\'14 with an extra lift potentially from the recent dollar depreciation. Yet Fed rate-setters are split over the outlook, and market confidence in Fed forecasts has ebbed. \uc2 Charles Plosser\uc2 , a former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, says: \u8220\'20\'1CI do think economists need to work harder on understanding the inflation process.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The shortfalls are by no means confined to the US. In the euro area, a sharp drop in unemployment across the region is yet to be matched by a strong pick-up in wages \u8212\'20\'14 without which officials fear inflation will fail to hit its goal of just under 2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Mario Draghi\uc2 , president of the European Central Bank, said this year that \u8220\'20\'1Cbackward-looking\u8221\'20\'1D negotiation of nominal wages that reference low inflation rates may be restraining prices. Many of the new jobs are also in temporary or part-time employment, which may slow the growth of nominal wages as well. At the \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2 , meanwhile, officials\u8217\'20\'19 struggles with achieving inflation targets are well documented.\par \par \uc2 In the US, whose monetary policy has global reach, questions about inflation are compounded by the uncertainty over who will call the shots from February. Mr Trump will have the opportunity to appoint up to five new Fed board members by next year, but attempting to predict his choices seems futile given the capricious nature of his personnel decisions.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts argue that the central bank could end up drifting in a hawkish direction \u8212\'20\'14 which would worry economists with a firm eye on low inflation. Mr Trump may not reappoint Ms Yellen, who inhabits the dovish end of the policy spectrum. A number of the alternative candidates for chair have shown signs of more hawkish leanings \u8212\'20\'14 among them the Stanford academics \uc2 Kevin Warsh\uc2  and John Taylor.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, Mr Trump has called himself a \u8220\'20\'1Clow-rates person\u8221\'20\'1D and there are precedents for presidents leaning on Fed leadership to keep policy loose \u8212\'20\'14 even when inflation threatens to start to pick up. \uc2 Richard Nixon\uc2  pressured Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the early 1970s, for example. While an inflationary upsurge may currently seem unlikely, economists have such a thin grasp on what drives inflation that it is far from impossible \u8212\'20\'14 as observers including Mr Paul continue to warn.\par \par \uc2 If inflation fails to reassert itself, the Fed and other central banks will find it harder to balance the need for low rates against the hazardous side-effects loose policy engenders in markets. Mr Faust says: \u8220\'20\'1CIf the central bank keeps pushing it can make inflation go up \u8212\'20\'14 but the question is whether some other excess bubbles up first.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The low-inflation enigma looks set to continue bedevilling policy not only in the US but across the world.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Claire Jones in Frankfurt\par \par \uc2 Brexit effect: Pound\u8217\'20\'19s depreciation feeds into rising prices\par \par \uc2 Unlike the US, the UK is witnessing a burst of inflation that is causing a dilemma for the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 . But the reasons have little to do with low interest rates and quantitative easing and much more to do with Brexit.\par \par \uc2 Inflation in the UK, like that in the US and across the eurozone, had been firmly stuck below the BoE\u8217\'20\'19s 2 per cent target until the British public voted to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2  in June 2016; inflation hit a low of -0.1 per cent in September 2015. But the depreciation of the pound since the vote last year has pushed up the price of imported products, which has fed through into consumer prices. The trade-weighted sterling exchange rate has fallen by 11 per cent since the referendum and had dropped by as much as 16 per cent at its lowest point in mid-October last year.\par \par \uc2 This helped push inflation to a five-year high of 2.9 per cent in August, with many analysts predicting it will continue to move higher over the next few months and peak somewhere at or above 3 per cent towards the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 Many businesses had taken out currency hedges to cushion the impact of a fall in the value of sterling last year. But most of these hedges were for no more than 12 months, meaning the fall in the pound has gradually been felt by companies in the cost of imported goods and passed on to consumers. A pick-up in oil and other commodity prices has also boosted inflation.\par \par \uc2 But there is little sign that the depreciation-driven inflation is leading to any pick-up in domestically generated price rises.\par \par \uc2 Wage growth has remained subdued and the rate of growth of prices for services has not accelerated over the past year. And with sterling rising in recent weeks, some of the inflationary pressure from the currency could also dissipate.\par \par \uc2 Gemma Tetlow\par \par \uc2 Letter in response to this article:\par \par \uc2 Too much money chasing too few goods / From Peter Rawlings, Chalfont St Peter, Bucks, UK\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170918ed9i0083p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

That tune faded into obscurity over the following six decades while the S&P 500 developed into the primary US stock market index and the world's most widely followed financial benchmark.\par \par \uc2 Around $8.7tn in assets are now benchmarked against the S&P 500 via index-tracking mutual funds, derivatives and structured products.\par \par \uc2 "The S&P 500 trades in every sphere. This provides a model that other countries, such as Brazil, South Korea and India, can follow to build thriving capital markets and promote economic growth," says \uc2 Alex Matturri\uc2 , the chief executive of S&P Dow Jones Indices.\par \par \uc2 The business led by the New Jersey-born Mr Matturri is surfing a wave of new business flooding into low-cost index-tracking funds from investors who have become disenchanted with the high fees and poor performance of traditional actively managed products that aim to beat the market.\par \par \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2  is the largest provider of benchmarks to the exchange traded fund industry, which is on course for a fourth consecutive year of record-breaking growth in 2017. ETF assets tied to \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2  passed the $1tn milestone this year and account for the fastest growth within the division's revenues. Although ETFs carry low fees, they can be highly profitable. \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2  earned operating profits of $412m in 2016 from revenues of $639m. This translates into a profit margin of 64 per cent, far higher than most asset managers.\par \par \uc2 "Indexing is a scale business, similar to other intellectual property businesses. Those pennies from ETF fees add up," says the 58-year-old.\par \par \uc2 ETF managers, however, are fighting a cut-throat price war to win new business and are desperate to save money. Some, including \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world's largest fund manager, are threatening to "self-index" by creating in-house indices that could replace the benchmarks offered by commercial providers.\par \par \uc2 Mr Matturri believes self-indexing is a misleading solution, as asset managers would never use a rival's benchmark to create an ETF. This could constrain growth across the ETF industry instead of fostering the competition that has driven down fees and attracted investor inflows.\par \par \uc2 "Index licensing fees are really only a small part of the overall cost of an ETF. There are 90 different index providers, so there are plenty of choices if anyone thinks our fees are too high. But some index brands really can't be substituted," says the father of two grown-up children.\par \par \uc2 He is also adamant that self-indexing would create unmanageable conflicts of interest for asset managers, which would be involved in the trading and pricing of the assets held by ETFs that they sell to investors.\par \par \uc2 "The best way to avoid conflicts of interest is to ensure that the indexing business is not part of the same shop, and not just separated by invisible Chinese walls or located on a different floor in the same building. Our only goal is to make sure that an index does what it is supposed to do," he says, adding that \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2  does not sell investment products.\par \par \uc2 The largest indexing providers, \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2  and its two main rivals, MSCI and FTSE Russell, were largely unregulated before the Libor scandal forced regulators to re-examine the critical role benchmarks play in financial markets.\par \par \uc2 Rules that will introduce a common framework and consistent approach to benchmark regulation across the \uc2 EU\uc2  are due to come into force at the start of 2018.\par \par \uc2 "The major index providers will be ready, but the lack of knowledge among some of the smaller players of the impact of the European regulations is quite astonishing. There could be some rude awakenings," says Mr Matturri.\par \par \uc2 The UK's decision to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2  has led to some head-scratching as the European headquarters of \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2  is located in London and pre-Brexit the \uc2 UK's Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  would most likely have acted as its main regulator outside the US. So a European regulator must be found to ensure \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2  can continue to passport its indices across Europe.\par \par \uc2 "We are currently in discussions with a number of regulators to determine which functions need to be run locally. We are not planning on moving any of the commercial functions from London , but a few compliance and operational staff will have to be located in Europe," says Mr Matturri.\par \par \uc2 A keen student of military history, Mr Matturri has made no secret of his strategic ambition to expand his company's presence in fixed-income markets. This led to the creation in 2015 of an index based on the bonds issued by companies in the S&P 500. Ivy Investments, an arm of Wadell & Reed, the Kansas-based asset manager has launched a mutual fund based on this benchmark.\par \par \uc2 Mr Matturri hopes that futures and options trading based on the S&P 500 bond index will, in time, be developed to match the huge volume of derivatives dealing linked to the parent S&P 500 equity index.\par \par \uc2 A plan to acquire the bond indexing business of \uc2 Barclays\uc2  was thwarted by the technical and legal challenges of extracting those operations cleanly from the UK bank, but other deals have followed. \uc2 Barclays\uc2 ' indexing business was acquired by Bloomberg for about \u163\'00\'A3520m.\par \par \uc2 Last year, \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2  bought Trucost, a provider of environmental data and risk \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The deal reflects investor appetite for a better understanding of the risks that climate change poses to investors' portfolios.\par \par \uc2 Determined to ensure that investors retain as much choice as possible, Mr Matturri says the company plans to further expand its range of ESG offerings across its family of indices.\par \par \uc2 "Trucost has helped to beefed up our ESG capabilities. The skillset required of companies managing indices has become more complex as markets have evolved. That is likely to continue over the next 60 years," says Mr Matturri.\par \par \uc2 CV\par \par \uc2 Born November 14 1958\par \par \uc2 Total pay Not disclosed\par \par \uc2 Education\par \par \uc2 1976-80 BS (finance), \uc2 Lehigh University\par \par \uc2 1980-83 JD, \uc2 Syracuse University\par \par \uc2 Career\par \par \uc2 1983-84 Judicial law clerk, Superior Court of New Jersey\par \par \uc2 1984-86 Security analyst, \uc2 First Fidelity Bank\par \par \uc2 1986-87 Risk arbitrage analyst, Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette\par \par \uc2 1987-2000 Vice-president, BNY Mellon\par \par \uc2 2000-03 Director and senior index investment strategist, Deutsche AM\par \par \uc2 2003-07 Senior vice-president, Northern Trust AM\par \par \uc2 2007-12 Executive managing director, S&P Indices 2012 to present Chief executive, S&P Dow Jones Indices\par \par \uc2 2016 to present Chairman of the board,Index Industry Association\par \par \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\par \par \uc2 Founded 1884 (oldest index), 2012 (present company)\par \par \uc2 Employees 516\par \par \uc2 Headquarters New York\par \par \uc2 Ownership Joint venture between S&P Global (previously known as \uc2 McGraw-Hill\uc2 ) and \uc2 CME\uc2 ) and \par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170918ed9i00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc46}{\*\bkmkend toc46}\b \uc2 Nobody seems to know why there\u8217\'20\'19s no US inflation\b0\par\par\uc2 Sam Fleming in Washington \par \uc2 2,287 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2017\par 19:22\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Ron Paul, at least, has no regrets. The former Texas Congressman is one of the most prominent voices among those Americans who have long been deeply suspicious of the US central bank and its power to print money. When he ran for president in 2012, he assailed then Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke for debasing the currency and risking an inflationary upsurge by pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t have prices in the consumer market going up like in the 1970s but we should not be surprised if that happens,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Paul, who once brandished a silver coin as he lectured the former Fed chair on Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, certainty is harder to come by. As the Fed meets in Washington tomorrow, US central bankers, and their counterparts across the world, are genuinely flummoxed by recent low inflation readings.\par \par \uc2 Despite a recovery that is now the third-longest on record, America is trapped not in a 1970s-style, double-digit inflationary upsurge, but a slow-inflation quandary. Price growth jumped in August, driven by energy and accommodation prices, yet investors still doubt inflation will be strong enough to merit more than a couple of interest-rate rises before the end of 2018.\par \par \uc2 The uncertain outlook has confounded Fed policymakers just as the central bank prepares for a leadership overhaul in the new year. President Donald Trump, who will decide shortly on the replacement for current Fed chair \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2 , has managed to be on both sides of the question \u8212\'20\'14 slamming low rates last year during the election but welcoming them this year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is a puzzle and raises a real question what the Fed should do next; I would have thought we would have been seeing more inflation pressures by now,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jon Faust, a former adviser to Ms Yellen at the Fed now at \uc2 Johns Hopkins University\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CAt a time when there is a confusing economic picture we don\u8217\'20\'19t know who will be judging that picture in a few months\u8217\'20\'19 time at the Fed. That added uncertainty is not a good thing.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Having lifted rates twice this year in the face of this dreary inflation, the Fed is expected to keep the target range for its key rate at 1-1.25 per cent on Wednesday, even as it announces the gradual unwinding of its quantitative easing programme. Ms Yellen is likely to leave open the prospect of a further rate rise in December, as she banks on diminishing slack in the economy driving up prices amid a global growth rebound.\par \par \uc2 Yet the Fed\u8217\'20\'19s 2 per cent inflation target still appears out of reach \u8212\'20\'14 stripping out food and energy costs, it has not attained that rate for half a decade. It has been a quarter of a century since the Fed\u8217\'20\'19s favoured measure of inflation \u8212\'20\'14 personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy \u8212\'20\'14 last punched up above the still relatively sedate level of 3 per cent. It was just 1.4 per cent in the year to July. Wage growth, meanwhile, remains well below its pre-crisis pace at just 2.5 per cent.\par \par \uc2 In 2015 Ms Yellen set out a clear road map to higher goods and services inflation, making the traditional central bankers\u8217\'20\'19 argument that diminishing spare capacity would ultimately stoke up price and wage pressures. The trouble is that even as the economy grows steadily and joblessness falls to 4.4 per cent, inflation has this year undershot the levels suggested by her model.\par \par \uc2 Part of the problem is that the link between low unemployment and higher price growth embodied in the so-called Phillips curve has looked fragile for decades. Some officials suspect the Fed can afford an even stronger labour market without worrying about excessive price growth.\par \par \uc2 On one level, sluggish inflation combined with respectable growth is far from a bad thing \u8212\'20\'14 central bankers in the 1970s would have looked on the current paradigm with envy. But if inflation hovers too low it leaves the economy uncomfortably close to deflation and could damage the credibility of an institution that is meant to target 2 per cent inflation. Low rates and low inflation leave little rate-cutting firepower when the next downturn strikes.\par \par \uc2 Fed chair: two hawkish contenders\par \par \uc2 Kevin Warsh\par \par \uc2 A former Fed governor currently at Stanford, he has called for reform of the central bank and has endorsed Donald Trump\u8217\'20\'19s goal of a 3% growth rate.\par \par \uc2 John Taylor\par \par \uc2 Also a Stanford economist who served in the George W Bush administration, he co-wrote a paper with Mr Warsh on the 3% growth target.\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 Weak inflation may also prompt the central bank to leave policy so loose that it inadvertently stokes up a cycle of boom and bust \u8212\'20\'14 something the Fed has repeatedly been accused of doing in recent decades. That worry has reasserted itself thanks to soaring asset valuations. \u8220\'20\'1CThe risk is that you are going to end up with interest rates that are too low relative to what is consistent with financial and macroeconomic stability,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Claudio Borio\uc2 , head of the monetary and economic department at the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CIf inflation doesn\u8217\'20\'19t show up, it will be hard to move interest rates up at the right speed to address this issue.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A five-month-long string of weak figures this year has prompted some Fed policymakers, including \uc2 Bill Dudley\uc2  of the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  and Rob Kaplan of the Dallas Fed, to start asking searching questions. Are globalisation and technological advances restraining inflation at a time when a cyclical pick-up might otherwise drive it higher?\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese two forces are colliding,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Kaplan told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  last month. \u8220\'20\'1CThe cyclical forces we have understood historically; the structural forces are somewhat new, particularly technology-enabled disruption.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Some policymakers cite the increased ease with which shoppers can compare prices on the internet and the impact these changes have on brand loyalty and pricing power. \uc2 Amazon\uc2  is entering grocery retail via \uc2 Whole Foods\uc2 , while the hotel sector is being overturned by \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 . \uc2 Rick Rieder\uc2 , chief investment officer of fixed income at \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , sees more price disruption to come, as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  promises to further transform some industries.\par \par \uc2 Research from Adobe \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  shows what online competition is doing in some fields. Online prices of furniture and bedding are down 8.3 per cent over the past two years, whereas the equivalent category in the consumer price index, which includes offline sales, has dropped less than half that amount. Sporting goods prices online are down 10 per cent, compared to 3.7 per cent in the CPI. Online clothing prices are down 6.5 per cent in the same period, compared with a 4.1 per cent offline drop.\par \par \uc2 Goods price deflation is not new in the US, and Pete Klenow of \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  says comparisons between online and offline prices baskets can be tricky because of their different constructions. While some Fed officials argue that technology is eroding companies\u8217\'20\'19 ability to lift prices, \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  analysts recently found an increase in corporate pricing power over the past 20 years, consistent with a rise in profit margins and industry concentration.\par \par \uc2 Goldman economists also question arguments that ecommerce, which accounts for around 8 per cent of retail sales \u8212\'20\'14 is having an appreciable impact on broader inflation. The effects of online competition on traditional retailers\u8217\'20\'19 pricing may be no larger than those seen during the rise of \u8220\'20\'1Cbig box\u8221\'20\'1D superstore chains like \uc2 Walmart\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other analysts have been looking closely at the labour market, linking paltry wage growth to the soggy inflation readings. Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the OECD, the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations, says higher job insecurity and lower labour force mobility in the US may be stifling calls for higher wages. \u8220\'20\'1CWorkers and producers are unsure that the market is actually going to be robust enough to support higher wage and price demands.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 While goods price inflation has been negative for much of the post-crisis period, Ms Mann highlights a weakening in services price inflation from 3 per cent before the crisis to closer to 2 per cent now. She is examining the growing role of services jobs held disproportionately by women who are paid less than men. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is really tough to get inflation up if wages are not rising,\u8221\'20\'1D she says.\par \par \uc2 At the Fed, some officials struggle to see why big structural factors would have intervened to crush inflation numbers. Instead, the Fed has suggested this year\u8217\'20\'19s dull outcomes are being driven by a series of coincidental, one-off drags, including a fall in wireless data prices.\par \par \uc2 If they are right, the jump in inflation last month could herald further gains \u8212\'20\'14 with an extra lift potentially from the recent dollar depreciation. Yet Fed rate-setters are split over the outlook, and market confidence in Fed forecasts has ebbed. \uc2 Charles Plosser\uc2 , a former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, says: \u8220\'20\'1CI do think economists need to work harder on understanding the inflation process.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The shortfalls are by no means confined to the US. In the euro area, a sharp drop in unemployment across the region is yet to be matched by a strong pick-up in wages \u8212\'20\'14 without which officials fear inflation will fail to hit its goal of just under 2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Mario Draghi\uc2 , president of the European Central Bank, said this year that \u8220\'20\'1Cbackward-looking\u8221\'20\'1D negotiation of nominal wages that reference low inflation rates may be restraining prices. Many of the new jobs are also in temporary or part-time employment, which may slow the growth of nominal wages as well. At the \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2 , meanwhile, officials\u8217\'20\'19 struggles with achieving inflation targets are well documented.\par \par \uc2 In the US, whose monetary policy has global reach, questions about inflation are compounded by the uncertainty over who will call the shots from February. Mr Trump will have the opportunity to appoint up to five new Fed board members by next year, but attempting to predict his choices seems futile given the capricious nature of his personnel decisions.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts argue that the central bank could end up drifting in a hawkish direction \u8212\'20\'14 which would worry economists with a firm eye on low inflation. Mr Trump may not reappoint Ms Yellen, who inhabits the dovish end of the policy spectrum. A number of the alternative candidates for chair have shown signs of more hawkish leanings \u8212\'20\'14 among them the Stanford academics \uc2 Kevin Warsh\uc2  and John Taylor.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, Mr Trump has called himself a \u8220\'20\'1Clow-rates person\u8221\'20\'1D and there are precedents for presidents leaning on Fed leadership to keep policy loose \u8212\'20\'14 even when inflation threatens to start to pick up. \uc2 Richard Nixon\uc2  pressured Arthur Burns to keep rates low in the early 1970s, for example. While an inflationary upsurge may currently seem unlikely, economists have such a thin grasp on what drives inflation that it is far from impossible \u8212\'20\'14 as observers including Mr Paul continue to warn.\par \par \uc2 If inflation fails to reassert itself, the Fed and other central banks will find it harder to balance the need for low rates against the hazardous side-effects loose policy engenders in markets. Mr Faust says: \u8220\'20\'1CIf the central bank keeps pushing it can make inflation go up \u8212\'20\'14 but the question is whether some other excess bubbles up first.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The low-inflation enigma looks set to continue bedevilling policy not only in the US but across the world.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Claire Jones in Frankfurt\par \par \uc2 Brexit effect: Pound\u8217\'20\'19s depreciation feeds into rising prices\par \par \uc2 Unlike the US, the UK is witnessing a burst of inflation that is causing a dilemma for the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 . But the reasons have little to do with low interest rates and quantitative easing and much more to do with Brexit.\par \par \uc2 Inflation in the UK, like that in the US and across the eurozone, had been firmly stuck below the BoE\u8217\'20\'19s 2 per cent target until the British public voted to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2  in June 2016; inflation hit a low of -0.1 per cent in September 2015. But the depreciation of the pound since the vote last year has pushed up the price of imported products, which has fed through into consumer prices. The trade-weighted sterling exchange rate has fallen by 11 per cent since the referendum and had dropped by as much as 16 per cent at its lowest point in mid-October last year.\par \par \uc2 This helped push inflation to a five-year high of 2.9 per cent in August, with many analysts predicting it will continue to move higher over the next few months and peak somewhere at or above 3 per cent towards the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 Many businesses had taken out currency hedges to cushion the impact of a fall in the value of sterling last year. But most of these hedges were for no more than 12 months, meaning the fall in the pound has gradually been felt by companies in the cost of imported goods and passed on to consumers. A pick-up in oil and other commodity prices has also boosted inflation.\par \par \uc2 But there is little sign that the depreciation-driven inflation is leading to any pick-up in domestically generated price rises.\par \par \uc2 Wage growth has remained subdued and the rate of growth of prices for services has not accelerated over the past year. And with sterling rising in recent weeks, some of the inflationary pressure from the currency could also dissipate.\par \par \uc2 Gemma Tetlow\par \par \uc2 Letter in response to this article:\par \par \uc2 Too much money chasing too few goods / From Peter Rawlings, Chalfont St Peter, Bucks, UK\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020170918ed9i0086h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

It was estimated at \u163\'00\'A3328bn (\u8364\'20\'AC365bn) this year by the International Longevity Centre, a UK think tank.\par \par \uc2 Hymans said if more people were squeezed out of jobs by robots or \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  then the retirement savings crisis was set to worsen.\par \par \uc2 "If one in three jobs are at risk of automation by 2030, as estimated, then this would mean retirement shortfalls increase to \u163\'00\'A32.3tn, or one year's current UK economic output," Hymans said.\par \par \uc2 "The income shortfall of those at working age, relative to the living wage, would be another \u163\'00\'A31.25tn."\par \par \uc2 If there was as much employment uncertainty in the long term as many predict, Hymans said, debates around the state pension age could "become irrelevant" - particularly if many jobs were fully automated or significantly computerised and the growth in new jobs failed to keep pace, warned Hymans.\par \par \uc2 Since the Bank made its forecast in 2015 about the number of jobs that could be lost to robots, concerns about the impact of automation on the workforce have climbed up the policy agenda.\par \par \uc2 Last week, the Trades Union Congress, an umbrella organisation for UK trade unions, said the economic gains from the spread of robots in the workforce should be used to reverse planned rises in the state pension age for millions aged in their forties.\par \par \uc2 PwC, the professional services group, has suggested that the increased use of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  could provide a 10 per cent boost to GDP, through lower costs and increased productivity for employers.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170916ed9g00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

It cited Beijing's support for the acquisition, the potential transfer of intellectual property to China via the acquisition of Lattice and "the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity" to the US. Some of the company's products were also used by the \uc2 US government\uc2 , the White House said.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Cfius\uc2  and the president assess that the transaction poses a risk to the national security of the United States that cannot be resolved through mitigation," the White House added.\par \par \uc2 Lattice later released a statement announcing the termination of its acquisition by \uc2 Canyon Bridge Capital Partners\uc2 . "The transaction with Canyon Bridge was in the best interests of our shareholders, our customers, our employees and the United States," said \uc2 Darin Billerbeck\uc2  , chief executive.\par \par \uc2 The company, based in Portland, Oregon, specialises in programmable silicon chips, which makes them well suited for complex tasks such as \b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Other US companies that make this type of chip include \uc2 Xilinx\uc2 . Patrick Moorhead, chips analyst at Moor Insights, said programmable silicon chips were often incorporated in weapons and defence systems. "I think it's as simple as, there is Lattice silicon inside of military systems that the \uc2 US government\uc2  doesn't want to get in the hands of another country," he said.\par \par \uc2 Although Lattice does not currently sell equipment to the US military, it has done so in the past and the military often stockpiles chips that are incorporated into its designs. "Cruise missiles have chips in them that are 20 years old," Mr Moorhead said.\par \par \uc2 In the regulatory filing laying out its appeal to Mr Trump, Lattice had said that both it and its group of buyers had promised "substantial mitigation measures", adding: "Lattice remains of the view that the proposed transaction does not raise any national security concerns that cannot be addressed by the comprehensive mitigation measures that Lattice and [the acquirers] have proposed to implement."\par \par \uc2 The decision highlighted US sensitivity about Chinese investments and Beijing's interest in the US semiconductor sector, \uc2 Cfius\uc2  experts said. In December, \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  became the third president to block a deal on national security grounds when he rejected the acquisition of semiconductor equipment maker \uc2 Aixtron\uc2  by Chinese buyers.\par \par \uc2 Cfius\uc2  is facing calls for reform. \uc2 John Cornyn\uc2 , a Republican Senator for Texas, has been working on a bill that would establish a list of countries of special concern and subject minority investment in US companies and joint ventures to greater scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cornyn has made clear the changes are aimed at concerns over China's push to gain an economic advantage by acquiring US and other technology companies. In a speech in June, he accused China of seeking to "weaponise" investments in US companies.\par \par \uc2 See Lex Gillian Tett Comment\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170915ed9f00018\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

In addition to shrinking sales and heightened competition, Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us has been burdened with debt from a leveraged buyout 12 years ago.\par \par \uc2 The retailer has been in talks with holders of more than $5 billion in debt to extend 2018 maturities and stave off a chapter 11 filing. Still, the company and its restructuring advisers are considering filing for chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Va., the people said.\par \par \uc2 The potential filing would be propelled by the toy chain's suppliers tightening trade terms, including holding back on shipments unless Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us is able to make cash payments on delivery, the people added.\par \par \uc2 While Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us already has received a majority of its holiday shipments, it is still without a portion of the goods and could soon be cut off from receiving any fresh inventory, these people said.\par \par \uc2 More than most retailers, Toy \u8216\'20\'18R' Us depends on the holiday season to recoup losses and drive sales. Last fiscal year, the holiday quarter accounted for about 40% of its $11.5 billion in revenue.\par \par \uc2 The company hired restructuring law firm \uc2 Kirkland & Ellis LLP\uc2  to guide its refinancing discussions. In addition, the company has hired financial adviser \uc2 Alvarez & Marsal\uc2 , the people said. \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2  has publicly said it has been working with Lazard as its investment banker.\par \par \uc2 A Toys 'R' Us spokeswoman declined to comment. Last week, company said it planned to update investors on its refinancing activities and other plans during a second-quarter earnings call scheduled for Sept. 26.\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 Alvarez & Marsal\uc2  official declined to comment, while a Kirkland & Ellis spokeswoman had no immediate comment.\par \par \uc2 A Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us restructuring would add to a list of more than 20 retailers, including \uc2 RadioShack\uc2  and Payless Shoe Source, that have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2017. Another big box chain, \uc2 Staples Inc\uc2 ., recently agreed to be taken private in a leveraged buyout.\par \par \uc2 Industrywide, toy sales have been strong in recent years, though much of the growth is shifting to online sellers like \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and discounters like \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 . Amazon's toy sales were up 24% last year, compared with 5% for the overall market and five years of declines for \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2 , according to \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm One Click Retail.\par \par \uc2 Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us has also struggled with increasing competition for its Babies \u8216\'20\'18R' Us business, as sales of strollers, cribs and diapers are moving online. About 650 of the company's 1,700 stores include its Babies \u8216\'20\'18R' Us concept.\par \par \uc2 Retailers have been going after parents online, where Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/5-billion-reasons-toys-r-us-struggles-as-amazon-soars-1500283802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  admits it is behind }}}\uc2 . It is only now updating it dated technology platform so that it can accommodate must-have offers such as subscription systems. It also plans to improve its baby registry and loyalty program.\par \par \uc2 Some large toy brands, such as Lego and Star Wars, have also struggled recently, while the collectible Shopkins toys, which Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us helped launch, is on the downswing. Earlier this month, \uc2 Lego AS{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/lego-to-slash-1-400-jobs-posts-first-sales-drop-in-13-years-1504599603"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reported its first decline in sales in 13 years }}}\uc2  and said it would cut 8% of its workforce. Another toy maker, \uc2 Mattel Inc\uc2 ., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ceo-at-mattel-has-first-big-test-what-to-do-with-the-dividend-1497432609"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 replaced its chief executive earlier this year  }}}\uc2 after a slide in holiday sales.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us's advisers have been hunting for a bankruptcy loan which would help fund operations while under chapter 11 protection, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Toys \u8216\'20\'18R' Us was loaded up with debt when private-equity firms \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2 , \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Vornado Realty Trust\uc2  took it private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout before the financial crisis. The owners had been hoping to prepare the company for an initial public offering, but its weak financial performance made such a move unlikely. A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment, while Bain and Vornado didn't immediately respond to comment.\par \par \uc2 Write to Lillian Rizzo at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com }}}\uc2  and Soma Biswas at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:soma.biswas@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 soma.biswas@wsj.com }}}\uc2  and Soma Biswas at \par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROBK20170915ed9f000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Toys 'R' Us Inc\uc2 . could file for bankruptcy as soon as the next few weeks, as nervous suppliers have tightened terms for the retailer ahead of the crucial holiday selling season, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The company, like many other big box chains, has struggled as shopping shifts online, pushing down prices and reducing store visits. In addition to shrinking sales and heightened competition, \uc2 Toys 'R' Us\uc2  has been burdened with debt from a leveraged buyout 12 years ago.\par \par \uc2 The retailer has been in talks with holders of more than $5 billion in debt to extend 2018 maturities and stave off a chapter 11 filing. Still, the company and its restructuring advisers are considering filing for chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Va., the people said.\par \par \uc2 The potential filing would be propelled by the toy chain's suppliers tightening trade terms, including holding back on shipments unless \uc2 Toys 'R' Us\uc2  is able to make cash payments on delivery, the people added.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Toys 'R' Us\uc2  already has received a majority of its holiday shipments, it is still without a portion of the goods and could soon be cut off from receiving any fresh inventory, these people said.\par \par \uc2 More than most retailers, Toy 'R' Us depends on the holiday season to recoup losses and drive sales. Last fiscal year, the holiday quarter accounted for about 40% of its $11.5 billion in revenue.\par \par \uc2 The company hired restructuring law firm \uc2 Kirkland & Ellis LLP\uc2  to guide its refinancing discussions. In addition, the company has hired financial adviser \uc2 Alvarez & Marsal\uc2 , the people said. \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2  has publicly said it has been working with \uc2 Lazard\uc2  as its investment banker.\par \par \uc2 A Toys 'R' Us spokeswoman declined to comment. Last week, company said it planned to update investors on its refinancing activities and other plans during a second-quarter earnings call scheduled for Sept. 26.\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 Alvarez & Marsal\uc2  official declined to comment, while a Kirkland & Ellis spokeswoman had no immediate comment.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Toys 'R' Us\uc2  restructuring would add to a list of more than 20 retailers, including \uc2 RadioShack\uc2  and Payless Shoe Source, that have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2017. Another big box chain, \uc2 Staples Inc\uc2 ., recently agreed to be taken private in a leveraged buyout.\par \par \uc2 Industrywide, toy sales have been strong in recent years, though much of the growth is shifting to online sellers like \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and discounters like \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 . Amazon's toy sales were up 24% last year, compared with 5% for the overall market and five years of declines for \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2 , according to \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm One Click Retail.\par \par \uc2 Toys 'R' Us\uc2  has also struggled with increasing competition for its Babies 'R' Us business, as sales of strollers, cribs and diapers are moving online. About 650 of the company's 1,700 stores include its Babies 'R' Us concept.\par \par \uc2 Retailers have been going after parents online, where \uc2 Toys 'R' Us{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/5-billion-reasons-toys-r-us-struggles-as-amazon-soars-1500283802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  admits it is behind}}}\uc2 . It is only now updating it dated technology platform so that it can accommodate must-have offers such as subscription systems. It also plans to improve its baby registry and loyalty program.\par \par \uc2 Some large toy brands, such as Lego and Star Wars, have also struggled recently, while the collectible Shopkins toys, which \uc2 Toys 'R' Us\uc2  helped launch, is on the downswing. Earlier this month, \uc2 Lego AS{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/lego-to-slash-1-400-jobs-posts-first-sales-drop-in-13-years-1504599603"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reported its first decline in sales in 13 years}}}\uc2  and said it would cut 8% of its workforce. Another toy maker, \uc2 Mattel Inc\uc2 ., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ceo-at-mattel-has-first-big-test-what-to-do-with-the-dividend-1497432609"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 replaced its chief executive earlier this year }}}\uc2 after a slide in holiday sales.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks \uc2 Toys 'R' Us\uc2 's advisers have been hunting for a bankruptcy loan which would help fund operations while under chapter 11 protection, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Toys 'R' Us\uc2  was loaded up with debt when private-equity firms \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2 , \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Vornado Realty Trust\uc2  took it private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout before the financial crisis. The owners had been hoping to prepare the company for an initial public offering, but its weak financial performance made such a move unlikely. A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment, while Bain and Vornado didn't immediately respond to comment.\par \par \uc2 Write to Lillian Rizzo at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Soma Biswas at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:soma.biswas@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 soma.biswas@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170915ed9f0063h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Martin \par \uc2 449 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)\par \uc2 AWSJ\par B4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SEOUL -- \uc2 Samsung Electronics Co\uc2 . has created a $300 million fund targeting new investments for automotive software and technology, the latest sign of the world's largest smartphone maker's desire to diversify beyond traditional electronics.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2  said Thursday that it had secured the first investment from the automotive-innovation fund, spending 75 million euros ($89 million) to create a strategic partnership with TTTech, a company that specializes in safeguarding the real-time computer systems used in connected cars. \uc2 Audi AG\uc2  is also a major investor in the Austria-based TTTech.\par \par \uc2 The South Korean technology giant has identified the automotive sector as a critical area for growth, as cars are increasingly outfitted with multimedia platforms and high-tech software -- a potential windfall for \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's displays and semiconductor businesses.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2  has been accelerating investments and other efforts into the automotive space over the past year, following last year's announcement of an $8 billion deal to buy U.S. auto-parts supplier \uc2 Harman International Industries Inc\uc2 . Since then, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  has won regulatory approval in South Korea and California to test cars using its self-driving technology on public roads.\par \par \uc2 Like many of its Silicon Valley peers, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  doesn't plan to manufacture its own vehicles but sees vast potential to create autonomous-driving software it could one day sell to traditional car makers. \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's tests in South Korea install its \b \highlight22\uc2 deep-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms and other software onto a vehicle made by \uc2 Hyundai Motor Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The $300 million investment, called the Samsung Automotive Innovation Fund, will target bets on smart sensors, machine vision and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  that get used by connected cars, the company said. The firm is "excited to play a leadership role in supporting and shaping the future of smarter, more connected vehicles," said Young Sohn, a chief strategy officer at Samsung Electronics, in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The fund also serves as a statement that \uc2 Samsung\uc2  plans to continue making new investments following last month's conviction of the company's de facto leader, \uc2 Lee Jae-yong\uc2 . A Seoul court sentenced Mr. Lee, the company's vice chairman and the \uc2 Samsung\uc2  heir, to five years in prison for bribing South Korea's former president. Mr. Lee's lawyers have filed an appeal contesting the court verdict.\par \par \uc2 Three days after Mr. Lee's conviction, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  announced a fresh $2.3 billion investment in semiconductors. Chips and auto technology are areas Mr. Lee has signed off on as pillars for \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's direction.\par \par \uc2 Beyond Harman, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  has other auto-tech bets on several startups that focus on automated driving, sensors or high-performance computing.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170914000083"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170914ed9f00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The admission is likely to amplify\u160\'00\'A0criticism of its lax defences.\par \par \uc2 The Atlanta-based company said last week that hackers broke into its vaults in mid-May to steal names, social security numbers, dates of birth and other identifying information for 143m Americans, along with more than 200,000 sets of credit card numbers.\par \par \uc2 Since then, shares in the company have fallen about 30 per cent amid calls for hearings on the affair in both chambers of Congress, state-level investigations and a flurry of private lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 Late on Wednesday, in an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 update }}}\uc2  posted to its website, \uc2 Equifax\uc2  said that the criminals had exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts, which is a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language.\par \par \uc2 But Oege de Moor, chief executive and founder of Semmle, a software \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provider based in San Francisco, noted that the weakness \u8212\'20\'14 known by the code CVE-2017-5638 \u8212\'20\'14 had been {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://struts.apache.org/announce.html#a20170707"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 disclosed }}}\uc2  by the Struts project in March, along with \u8220\'20\'1Cclear and simple\u8221\'20\'1D instructions on how to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-045"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 fix it }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe fact that \uc2 Equifax\uc2  [was] attacked in May means that [it] did not follow that advice,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CHad they done so, this breach would not have occurred.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  could not be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 The disclosure is likely to heighten pressure on the company and \uc2 Richard F Smith\uc2 , its chief executive, who last week said that \uc2 Equifax\uc2  did not realise it had been breached until late July.\par \par \uc2 Earlier on Wednesday, a bipartisan group of US senators called for sweeping federal investigations of \uc2 Equifax\uc2  over stock sales by company executives \u8220\'20\'1Cwithin days\u8221\'20\'1D of the discovery of the raid.\par \par \uc2 In a joint letter to the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , the \uc2 US Department of Justice\uc2  and the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2 , the 36 senators \u8212\'20\'14 led by Democrat \uc2 Jack Reed\uc2  of Rhode Island and Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana \u8212\'20\'14 called published reports of such stock sales \u8220\'20\'1Cdisturbing\u8221\'20\'1D and urged a probe of potential violations of insider trading laws.\par \par \uc2 The lawmakers also asked for regulators\u8217\'20\'19 findings on \u8220\'20\'1Cwhether \uc2 Equifax\uc2  management employed reasonable measures to ensure the security of the now compromised data\u8221\'20\'1D.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe request that you spare no effort in your investigations and in enforcing the law to the fullest extent against anyone who is found to be at fault,\u8221\'20\'1D they wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mr de Moor of Semmle said that his group had disclosed a new Struts vulnerability (CVE-2017-9805) to the cyber security community last week, jointly with the Struts developers. Many companies reacted promptly, he said, singling out \uc2 Cisco\uc2 , the networking group, which put out a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170907-struts2#vuln_prods"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 full account }}}\uc2  of the products that were affected by the vulnerability within 48 hours.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CForward-looking companies, which have the right procedures in place\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09reacted to the disclosure by taking remedial action,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170914ed9e0028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Other online lenders that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-gives-fico-low-score-1452556468"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 use alternative data}}}\uc2  in their lending decisions include Affirm Inc. and Avant Inc.\par \par \uc2 Aside from data security concerns, experts say traditional credit reports don't always capture borrowers' repayment ability, leading to millions of people not getting loans because they have a limited credit history.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB in February launched an inquiry into the use of alternative data sources by lenders. A CFPB spokesman declined to say if other companies have requested feedback on their practices, but said the bureau continues to hear from companies asking what it thinks about such practices. The CFPB spokesman said the timing of the guidance was unrelated to the Equifax data breach.\par \par \uc2 Lenders and regulators believe credit access for some customers could improve with the use of alternative data, which could also include rent and utility payment records. The use of such data, however, also raises concern about lending discrimination based on personal traits.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB was responding to Upstart's request for clarification regarding the application of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which bars banks and other lenders from discriminating against applicants based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status and age.\par \par \uc2 Upstart CEO Dave Girouard said in an interview that the idea of using alternative data, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  in lending requires the navigation of tricky issues. "There's an enormous opportunity to improve accuracy of credit models, but it could run afoul of fair-lending laws," he said.\par \par \uc2 Under the terms of the CFPB's guidance, Upstart agreed on a way to measure unintentional discrimination that may result from its loan program and to provide the bureau with regular compliance data. It also agreed to report information to them regarding how its \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  model is evolving over time "to given them a constant pulse as to whether there's anything in [our model] that will be of concern," Mr. Girouard said.\par \par \uc2 According to the CFPB's 2015 analysis of the top nationwide credit reporting companies, 26 million Americans have no credit history, a status known as credit invisibility. Another 19 million people have "thin files," meaning their credit histories are too limited or have been inactive for too long to generate a credit score.\par \par \uc2 Credit invisibility is most likely to affect minorities and people with lower incomes. About 15% of African-American and Hispanic consumers are credit invisible compared with 9% of white consumers, according to the CFPB.\par \par \uc2 Write to Yuka Hayashi at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:yuka.hayashi@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 yuka.hayashi@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Peter Rudegeair at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROFR20170914ed9e000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

That's because there are now fewer regulations to finish under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, thanks to the work of SEC chiefs who preceded him. The SEC might even be able to put the remaining Dodd-Frank requirements on the back burner, reflecting White House and congressional antipathy for the law.\par \par \uc2 So it's a bit surprising that his SEC is moving slowly so far. Mr. Clayton was sworn in May 4. It's been 133 days since then, and the commission has yet to vote on a proposed or final regulation. By comparison, the commission took 21 days to approve its first proposed rule after Mary Jo White, Mr. Clayton's immediate predecessor, took over in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Going back to the start of the 21st century, only former Chairman Christopher Cox took as many as 50 days to obtain a commission vote on his first proposed or final rule. Like Mr. Clayton, Mr. Cox was appointed by a Republican president who favored less regulation of financial markets. But under two previous Republican SEC chairmen, William Donaldson and \uc2 Harvey Pitt\uc2 , the SEC issued a proposed or final rule within a month of taking over.\par \par \uc2 It's fair to observe that Mr. Clayton isn't rushing into new rules because he wants to make it easier, not more cumbersome, for companies to raise capital. He also doesn't seem to face any pressing demand by Republican congressional leaders or the White House to move faster. But under the laws that govern how regulatory agencies function, loosening requirements usually requires a commission vote. Even deregulation takes time.\par \par \uc2 An SEC spokesman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton has also moved slowly to fill out the commission's senior staff. He still hasn't named permanent directors for two divisions that Wall Street watches closely\u8212\'20\'14Trading and Markets, which oversees exchanges, and the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations, which inspects regulated financial firms. His top choice to run Trading and Markets dropped out of consideration after he had been under review for several months.\par \par \uc2 The SEC chief could be waiting for two new commissioners to join before he gets started in earnest with regulatory changes. The White House has picked Republican Hester Peirce and Democrat Robert Jackson to fill the vacancies. While both Ms. Peirce and Mr. Jackson are likely to be confirmed, the Senate could take weeks, if not longer, to do so.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton has proceeded cautiously to build and execute an agenda of his own. But the clock is ticking: If a Democrat is elected president in 2020, the SEC's chief is likely to step down. The agency also tends to do less around the time of congressional elections, which are coming up next year. At some point soon, key stakeholders will want to see action on what Mr. Clayton has primed them to expect.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Equifax Faces Bumpy Legal Terrain as Consumer Suits Mount\par \par \uc2 By Jacob Gershman\par \par \uc2 Credit-reporting company \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 ., EFX -14.63% which last week suffered a massive data breach, could face a tougher challenge in court than other corporate giants that have dealt with the legal fallout of data breaches, according to legal experts.\par \par \uc2 Unlike earlier retailer hacks, such as those suffered by \uc2 Home Depot Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Target Corp\uc2 . , the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  breach is bigger in scope, potentially compromising the personal information\u8212\'20\'14including Social Security and driver's license numbers\u8212\'20\'14of roughly 143 million U.S. consumers.\par \par \uc2 The legal terrain, meanwhile, has become bumpier for hacking defendants. A few years ago, consumer litigation over data breaches had trouble even getting onto the docket. But as the number of hacking cases rises, judges have been increasingly willing to let data-breach plaintiffs have their day in court.\par \par \uc2 "Five or six years ago, it was much easier to simply get lawsuits dismissed," said Amy Mushahwar, a data-privacy and security attorney at \uc2 Davis Wright Tremaine LLP\uc2  in Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 Since \uc2 Equifax\uc2  disclosed last Thursday that hackers had gained access to some of its systems, more than 100 lawsuits have been filed in federal courts across the country, according to a review by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Equifax\uc2 's only job in life was to safeguard data," said Marc Dann, whose Ohio law firm and co-counsel have brought lawsuits against \uc2 Equifax\uc2  in at least seven states.\par \par \uc2 Finding aggrieved plaintiffs didn't take a lot of searching, Mr. Dann said. "I couldn't take out the garbage without someone asking me to represent them in this case," he said.\par \par \uc2 An Equifax spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. The company said last week that it is offering free identity-theft protection and credit-monitoring to U.S. consumers. "We pride ourselves on being a leader in managing and protecting data, and we are conducting a thorough review of our overall security operations," Equifax Chief Executive \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  said last week.\par \par \uc2 Many of the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  lawsuits allege the company was a negligent custodian of personal data that millions rely on to establish their identity and creditworthiness.\par \par \uc2 Most of the complaints bring their claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a 1970 federal law that imposes data-security requirements on consumer-reporting firms. The FCRA gives consumers rights to access their credit and ensure their credit file is accurate. The law offers per-violation damages that could be easier to prove than actual damages, but is little tested in the area of data-breach litigation.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, courts have generally declined to hear data-breach lawsuits trying to hold a company responsible for the havoc wrought by hackers. The reason: Plaintiffs in federal court generally must allege they suffered a concrete injury and that the injury can be redressed.\par \par \uc2 But more courts are warming to the idea that even the threat of identity theft\u8212\'20\'14and the aggravation, distress and cost of containing the risk\u8212\'20\'14can cause harm.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the dismissal of a lawsuit against health insurer \uc2 CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield\uc2  over a 2015 data breach. The appellate judges disagreed with a lower court finding that the injury claims were too speculative.\par \par \uc2 CareFirst said it plans to ask the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  to take up the issue. The company's lawyers stated in their filing that they want the justices to "guide courts in sorting out the claims of truly injured victims of data breaches from those who file class actions without being able to allege that any harm is real."\par \par \uc2 The breadth of the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  breach could make it harder for the credit-reporting company to either win the cases in court or settle them cheaply, say legal experts.\par \par \uc2 When credit- or debit-card information is compromised, as in data breaches at Target and \uc2 Home Depot\uc2 , consumers could minimize the risk of identity theft or fraud by getting new cards and enrolling in credit-monitoring services.\par \par \uc2 With \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , hackers gained access to servers containing customers' names, social-security numbers, birth dates and addresses. The exposure of that personal information, which consumers use to apply for credit cards or to take out loans, raises the specter of a longer-term privacy threat that could encourage plaintiffs to push further into the discovery process instead of settling early, said Craig Newman, a cybersecurity lawyer at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP.\par \par \uc2 Florida Is Short on Insurance Adjusters, and That Could Stall Recovery Efforts\par \par \uc2 By Leslie Scism and Nicole Friedman\par \par \uc2 After Irma, Florida residents are lacking in many necessities. One of the more frustrating is the paucity of insurance adjusters, which is threatening to anger policyholders and potentially delay the state's rebuilding efforts.\par \par \uc2 Many of the state's adjusters are 1,000 miles away, working on claims made after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are scrambling to get more adjusters to Florida, creating a bidding war for those who are available. Some Florida home insurers have increased fees paid to adjusters by about 30%, insurers and adjusters say.\par \par \uc2 Citizens Property Insurance Corp\uc2 ., a state-run insurer of last resort, has boosted adjuster compensation by 18% to 20% and said it expects additional increases to keep up with rivals.\par \par \uc2 While higher fees for adjusters often only modestly impact the cost of a claim, the bigger worry is that damage to buildings will worsen from mold and other problems. In addition, claims that could have been resolved amicably may end up in costly litigation as homeowners get angry waiting.\par \par \uc2 "An insurance claim isn't a bottle of wine," said Randy Maniloff, an insurance-industry defense lawyer at Williams and White LLP.\par \par \uc2 Insurance companies are vying for the nation's independent claims adjusters, who total 57,200 as of July, according to the \uc2 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 . \u8203\'20\'0BFlorida also says it is easing the process of appointing insurance adjusters, which may help expand the number.\par \par \uc2 "Our Department has taken steps to make the adjuster-appointment process as simple \u8203\'20\'0B[as] \u8203\'20\'0Bpossible for insurance companies, and our team is processing appointments at a rapid-fire pace" in an effort "to ensure that Floridians get swift handling of their post-storm claims," said a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Financial Services. In addition, many insurance companies employ adjusters full-time and a lot of those will be on the ground, among other types of adjusters who could be available.\par \par \uc2 Lee Vorcheimer, a longtime adjuster in south Florida, said that "every day for the last two weeks, there have been 10 or 15 emails" from independent-adjuster firms seeking to recruit him to travel to Texas or handle claims for local insurers. He has been offered bonuses, including money for temporary housing.\par \par \uc2 Independent insurance adjusters are paid according to the size of a claim they assess for a company. For Irma claims, they are earning from about $500 to about $30,000 for policyholder claims of $1,000 to $1 million, respectively, according to two fee schedules from private insurers reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Some adjusters can make $65,000 to $100,000 in the first month after a major hurricane, people in the industry say.\par \par \uc2 "When you have a hurricane like Harvey and a hurricane like Irma, everybody loves you," said Mr. Vorcheimer, who settled on adjusting Irma claims for Tampa-based \uc2 HCI Group Inc\uc2 ., in part because he likes their technology.\par \par \uc2 This week, Mr. Vorcheimer began inspections as early as 7:30 a.m., looking at up to 15 properties a day. In Broward County on Monday, he found trees on roofs, missing shingles, rain damage, and blown-over pool screens and fences. Damage ranged up to about $65,000, he said. He hauled ladders from his pickup truck and climbed on every roof. He finished his day just after 7 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vorcheimer, 51 years old, got into adjusting in 2005 after selling a bakery and a neighbor recruited him to help with Hurricane Wilma claims. His wife, Cheryl, handles administrative matters for the business, Perfect Reliable Independent Claim Services Inc.\u8203\'20\'0B. Like many other adjusters, the couple uses a 45-foot recreational vehicle when traveling to inspect long-distance claims. The couple is living there temporarily as their home in Pompano Beach has no power.\par \par \uc2 Though Irma didn't strike Miami, the state's largest city, as feared, damages from the storm could be large enough to displace Sandy as the nation's third most-expensive hurricane ever. That 2012 storm left $20 billion in losses, in today's dollars, mostly in the northeast. On Wednesday, catastrophe-risk modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. estimated Irma's U.S. damage at $18 billion.\par \par \uc2 The adjuster issues are especially acute in Florida because its home-insurance market is heavily dependent on small and midsize insurers. Over the past 25 years, many of the brand-name national insurers have shrunk their presence in the state to reduce their exposure to hurricanes.\par \par \uc2 Smaller insurance companies typically rely heavily on independent adjusters, said Joseph Burtone, an insurance analyst with ratings firm A.M. Best. The smaller insurers "have to figure out a way to handle that the best they can," he said. "It will be a challenge."\par \par \uc2 By comparison, the national insurers employ fleets of adjusters and can send people to Florida from other states. Many big names, such as \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 . and \u8203\'20\'0B\uc2 Liberty Mutual Insurance\uc2 , also contract with independent-adjuster firms as needed when disasters occur. \uc2 Chubb Ltd\uc2 . said it relies predominantly on its own staff.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Tim Barziza, a Texas-based "claim leader" for Chubb, was on the last leg of a drive to Miami to oversee a command center there. It is one of several such centers Chubb has set up across the state for taking care of well-to-do policyholders' homes, fine art, boats and vehicles, as well as business clients.\par \par \uc2 Roughly 400 Chubb employees are expected to handle claims and adjusting, either in the state or from call centers. Chubb adjusters are arriving "from all corners of the U.S.," Mr. Barziza said, taking a break from driving and watching as utility-truck convoys and vehicles with children, dogs and suitcases returned home. By Wednesday, Chubb had received just over 1,000 Irma claims, the overwhelming majority tied to home policies.\par \par \uc2 In addition to private insurers, many Florida claims will be processed by Citizens, which at about 450,000 policyholders is one of the state's biggest insurers. It expects about 150,000 claims, a spokesman said. As of 1 p.m. Tuesday, about 7,000 had arrived.\par \par \uc2 "A stale claim is an expensive claim," said John Rollins, an executive with Cabrillo Coastal General Insurance Agency LLC in Gainesville, Fla., and a former chief risk officer of Citizens. "The key in a situation like this is getting to the policyholder and getting some money in their hands so they can begin the recovery process."\par \par \uc2 As Florida's market gets stretched, insurance executives said the fee increases being paid to adjusters in Florida are spilling over to Texas.\par \par \uc2 "There's a tug of war for adjusters" between the two states, said James Warren, who works as an adjuster for \uc2 Crawford & Co\uc2 ., which handles claims for insurance companies.\par \par \uc2 Some adjusters who would ordinarily stay for two months or longer to adjust claims for a hurricane like Harvey are already heading to Florida, he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warren is currently adjusting Harvey claims in south Texas, and opted not to go to Florida because he wants to stay close to his home in the Lone Star state.\par \par \uc2 "Right now, anyone with a license to adjust claims can get a job and some company will try them out," Mr. Warren said. "They're paying more for adjusters to work Irma than they've ever paid insurance adjusters ever."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warren's firm, Crawford, is running an orientation program in Atlanta to get hundreds of longtime adjusters up to speed on protocols of clients with claims to adjust in Florida. The firm is moving adjusters from Canada and the U.K. to Florida as well, said Chief Executive Harsha Agadi.\par \par \uc2 This week, HCI, the Tampa-based insurer, signed up adjusters from Massachusetts to augment its Florida team. "Everybody is pressing into service everybody and anybody they can get," CEO \uc2 Paresh Patel\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Typically, insurers have contingency plans for hurricanes, "but we watched all of our contingency resources go to Houston" after Harvey, he said.\par \par \uc2 There's Never Been a Hotter Time to Freeze Your Credit\par \par \uc2 By AnnaMaria Andriotis, Daisy Maxey and Telis Demos\par \par \uc2 Until the \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . EFX -14.63% hack, many consumers didn't know what a credit freeze was. Now, the credit-reporting company's massive data breach has people reaching for the tool, a move that could have a host of implications for both consumers and the financial industry.\par \par \uc2 A freeze typically prevents lenders from accessing a potential borrower's credit report, although it doesn't affect existing credit arrangements such as outstanding loans or cards. A freeze makes it unlikely a firm would immediately extend new financing, which, while helping prevent fraud could also slow legitimate business.\par \par \uc2 Freezes are being promoted as a first line of defense in the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  breach, which potentially affected 143 million Americans. It is a more drastic step than credit monitoring, which alerts consumers to potentially fraudulent activity on their reports.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  peers TransUnion and \uc2 Experian PLC\uc2  said the number of credit-report freezes being requested by consumers increased significantly in the days after the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  news last week. Tens of thousands of U.S. consumers initiated credit freezes on Friday and Saturday alone, said Alex Lintner, president of consumer information services at Experian.\par \par \uc2 Demand to sign up for freezes appears to be so great that some consumers were complaining of delays or being unable to register on credit-reporting companies' websites. "The unprecedented number of consumers contacting us after the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  announcement has impacted our ability to respond to consumers as we would like," said TransUnion, adding it has taken steps to increase communications with consumers.\par \par \uc2 Previously, credit freezes were typically initiated by people who either had, say, their identity stolen or earlier instances of fraud on their accounts. While open to anyone and reversible temporarily or permanently, most consumers have in the past shied away from the step because it made getting new credit more cumbersome. In some states, consumers must pay a fee to temporarily or permanently lift a freeze.\par \par \uc2 In a country of free-flowing credit like the U.S., there is value to relatively open information about a consumer's creditworthiness. It makes it easier for someone to open a new credit card at a department store or gain quick approval for a mortgage.\par \par \uc2 But the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  hack appears to be changing some of that calculus, as worried consumers say they would rather have their default information status set to off-limits, unless they choose otherwise. That adjustment could change consumer behavior, the flow of consumer credit and, in extreme cases, the long-term rate of growth for consumer financing.\par \par \uc2 There is little official government data about freezes. A 2014 paper from researchers at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\uc2  estimated that about 2 million U.S. consumers placed a credit freeze or fraud alert on their credit reports in 2012. The paper also showed that freezes spiked in South Carolina that same year in response to a data breach at that state's Department of Revenue.\par \par \uc2 "This may start to affect some of the spontaneous nature of credit access," John Thompson, senior vice president at the Center for Financial Services Innovation, a nonprofit firm that focuses on consumer financial-health issues.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Mark, of Chicago, froze his credit report with \uc2 Equifax\uc2  this week and is considering doing the same with the other credit-reporting firms.\par \par \uc2 "When a credit agency gets hacked, they have very sensitive information," said the 65-year-old architect, who plans to freeze his credit indefinitely. Mr. Mark said he isn't a big acquirer of credit cards, but expects that seeking credit will become "more of a hassle" with a freeze in place.\par \par \uc2 That's a trade-off he said he is willing to make. Given the amount of information about people taken in the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  breach, "it's very scary if that access becomes available to other people who shouldn't have it," he said.\par \par \uc2 Brendan Dickinson, of Darien, Conn., plans to shop for a car in the near future and said a freeze would make it harder to get credit. Still, that didn't stop him and his wife from freezing their credit reports with four companies\u8212\'20\'14the big three and another called Innovis\u8212\'20\'14in recent days.\par \par \uc2 "I've added a layer of pain for myself, but it seems worth it," said the 35-year-old partner at a venture-capital firm, adding that he expects to keep the freeze on for the foreseeable future.\par \par \uc2 Some businesses are worried about how the freezes might hurt business. At \uc2 Galpin Motors Inc\uc2 ., a Southern California auto retailer that sells brands such as Ford, Honda and Volvo, dealerships began training staff Monday on how to handle frozen credit reports, including who to call at the credit-reporting companies for help, said Brian Allan, a senior director.\par \par \uc2 Freezes, he added, create challenges for car buyers, potentially delaying purchases for days.\par \par \uc2 Currently, dealers can call up a credit score within minutes. When a credit report is frozen, it typically requires a customer to first unlock it with a password and then verify its release to the store via a phone call, Mr. Allan said.\par \par \uc2 Often, customers forget their passwords, and it can take up to 72 hours to retrieve it. Or the agency calls a home phone number to verify the request, even though the customer is at the store, Mr. Allan said.\par \par \uc2 "We have people come in, and they don't realize the extent of what we have to go through," he said.\par \par \uc2 Credit specialists said rising freezes could ding loan volume, including for credit cards and auto loans, at the margin.\par \par \uc2 "Overall, this would lower the actual credit volume and access to credit markets," said Kyle Herkenhoff, an assistant professor of macroeconomics at the University of Minnesota and a visiting scholar at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Credit growth was already slowing before the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  hack. The rate of year-over-year growth for consumer loans at all U.S. commercial banks fell to 4.1% in July, less than half the recent peak of 8.6% in July 2016, according to Federal Reserve data.\par \par \uc2 Freezes can also stall lending before it gets started. Lenders often purchase lists of borrowers who meet certain criteria from credit-reporting companies, including \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , to mail them credit offers. The lists exclude people who have frozen their reports.\par \par \uc2 "There probably will be some chilling effect on making credit offers," said Marla Blow, chief executive of FS Card Inc., which offers credit cards to subprime borrowers. "A spike in freezes is something we are acutely aware of and working through in real-time."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Christina Rogers contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: SEC Chairman Open to Softening Auditor Rule\par \par \uc2 SEC Chairman Jay Clayton suggests he's at least open to softening a long-contested rule that requires companies to have auditors evaluate their internal controls, the procedures they use to prevent financial errors or fraud. Supporters of the rule, part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, say it helps ensure companies are giving accurate numbers to investors. But business groups say the rule is too costly and burdensome for small companies, and the proposed Financial Choice Act pending in Congress would exempt many more companies from having to follow it. At a meeting of an SEC advisory panel that discussed the issue, Clayton says, "To get to a good audit you have to have good controls, but the devil is in the details, and we should be exploring them."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: SEC Chairman Suggests the Midwest Could Use a Few More VCs\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 Memo to venture capitalists: the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  wants to know why you don't have an Indianapolis branch office.\par \par \uc2 Jay Clayton, the SEC's chairman appointed by the Trump administration, asked on Wednesday why the Midwest has so few venture capitalists even though the region hosts so many large, established companies. "Over 100 Fortune 500 companies\u8212\'20\'14but only 4% of U.S. venture funds," Mr. Clayton said at a meeting of the SEC's small business advisory committee. "It doesn't make sense you would have that robust an economy and so few people looking toward the future."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, formerly a corporate attorney in New York and London, has taken an interest in longstanding complaints that it is too hard for smaller companies to raise money from investors. The SEC's staff is considering how deregulation could make it easier on them, with an eye toward helping entrepreneurs who live far away from Silicon Valley and New York.\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalists are largely unregulated by the SEC, but the agency does administer rules that restrict how private and public companies raise money and compensate employees by issuing shares.\par \par \uc2 The Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would ease the ability of smaller firms to issue more shares as compensation to employees. The SEC's small business committee on Wednesday was discussing a similar measure that the SEC could implement on its own.\par \par \uc2 Foreign Investors Snap Up Chinese Bank Debt\par \par \uc2 By Shen Hong\par \par \uc2 SHANGHAI\u8212\'20\'14Foreign investors last month more than tripled their holdings of a popular short-term debt instrument issued by Chinese banks\u8212\'20\'14reflecting both the attraction of a rising yuan and a growing risk appetite.\par \par \uc2 That made them among the leading buyers of "negotiable certificates of deposit" or NCDs in August, a rare position for foreign investors in any Chinese debt market. Central banks and sovereign-wealth funds were big buyers, according to a Shanghai-based banker at a global bank that trades on behalf of such foreign investors.\par \par \uc2 NCDs\u8212\'20\'14effectively high-yielding bonds, generally with maturities of a month to a year\u8212\'20\'14have become extremely popular with Chinese banks, especially smaller lenders, since their launch in late 2013. But as concerns have grown that banks are issuing them as a tool for leveraged investment rather than to meet genuine refinancing needs, they have drawn heightened scrutiny from Chinese regulators, who recently imposed a partial ban.\par \par \uc2 Foreign investors' holdings surged to 88.3 billion yuan ($13.5 billion) in August, from 24.5 billion in July and just 2.2 billion yuan in January, according to data provider WIND Info. Their net 63.8 billion yuan in purchases last month put them second only to a group of nonbank institutions that include Chinese brokerages, insurers and trust companies. Still, foreign investors' holdings account for only 1% of the NCD market.\par \par \uc2 "The yuan's sharp appreciation must be a key reason behind foreign investors' interest in NCDs and the latter's high returns make them even more attractive, especially compared with the lower government bond yields," said Liu Dongliang, senior analyst at \uc2 China Merchants Bank\uc2  . The yuan has staged an unexpected comeback against the dollar, delivering a 6% gain this year after a 6.6% loss last year.\par \par \uc2 Six-month NCDs issued by AAA-rated, midsize Chinese banks\u8212\'20\'14the most popular category of the product\u8212\'20\'14pay an average return of 4.6%, compared with 3.3% for six-month bills issued by the Chinese government and 3.6% for 10-year government bonds.\par \par \uc2 "This is a bit unexpected because the foreign investors in the Chinese market are typically risk-averse and some of them used to shun bonds issued by quasi-sovereign institutions like \uc2 China Development Bank\uc2 ," said Mr. Liu, referring to China's largest policy bank.\par \par \uc2 The NCD market has expanded to 8.5 trillion yuan, from 6.3 trillion at the end of last year and just 34 billion yuan at the end of 2013. In early April, the country's banking regulator criticized banks' speculative use of the instruments as "working without bending down" and "sitting there collecting free money," adding that banks should do more to ensure money flows to China's "real economy."\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 31, \uc2 China's central bank\uc2  said it will ban the issuance of NCDs with maturities longer than a year.\par \par \uc2 Canadian Exchange Weighs Risks in Trading U.S. Marijuana Stocks\par \par \uc2 By David George-Cosh\par \par \uc2 TORONTO\u8212\'20\'14As dozens of cannabis companies have flocked to raise capital on Canada's stock exchanges in recent years, the country's regulators are starting to question whether trading in their stock would run afoul of U.S. law.\par \par \uc2 The parent company of the Toronto Stock Exchange and an umbrella organization of Canadian securities regulators are looking at cannabis companies with U.S. operations\u8212\'20\'14including growers, medical-marijuana distributors and pharmaceutical firms whose products include marijuana ingredients\u8212\'20\'14to determine whether trading in their shares should be allowed to continue on Canadian exchanges.\par \par \uc2 The regulatory attention comes as the Toronto Stock Exchange and its smaller rival, the \uc2 Canadian Securities Exchange\uc2 , have been actively courting marijuana company listings from around the world. At present, roughly half the trading activity on the \uc2 Canadian Securities Exchange\uc2  is sourced from marijuana-based businesses, a high-growth sector.\par \par \uc2 Medical marijuana has been legal in Canada since 2001 for patients with valid prescriptions, and Canada is expected to formally legalize marijuana by July 2018. In the U.S., meanwhile, while eight states plus the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana, and an additional 20 states have legalized it for medical purposes, it remains illegal under federal law.\par \par \uc2 U.S. exchanges list shares of some companies indirectly involved in the pot business, such as real-estate firms that lease sites to marijuana growers. But neither the New York Stock Exchange nor Nasdaq will allow trading of shares in companies that profit directly from growing or selling marijuana in the U.S., lawyers say.\par \par \uc2 The exchanges wouldn't discuss their marijuana policies on the record. A Nasdaq spokeswoman pointed to an exchange rule stating that Nasdaq "stands for integrity and ethical business practices." NYSE's rule book says its listed companies "should proactively promote compliance with laws, rules and regulations."\par \par \uc2 TMX Group Ltd\uc2 . , parent of both the Toronto Stock Exchange and a clearinghouse unit, the \uc2 Canadian Depository for Securities Ltd\uc2 ., a platform where Canadian exchanges settle equity, debt and money-market transactions, has sought clarity from Canadian regulators on the question of whether settling stock trades of cannabis companies with U.S. operations amounts to a violation U.S. law, according to a TMX Group statement.\par \par \uc2 "This is a complex matter which touches multiple aspects across our capital market system, and as such requires close examination and careful consideration," said a TMX spokeswoman. The company is cooperating with Canadian Securities Administrators, the umbrella group of provincial and territorial securities regulators.\par \par \uc2 Neither regulators nor the exchange platform have announced when a formal ruling is expected, although some observers believe a decision could come in November, when the clearinghouse's board is scheduled to meet.\par \par \uc2 Any action by Canadian regulators is likely to be closely watched by other countries grappling with how to treat the trading and clearing of marijuana stocks. Exchanges in Germany and Israel, for example, two countries that recently legalized medical marijuana and have publicly-listed cannabis firms, have also been weighing listing standards for such companies.\par \par \uc2 "The industry wants clarity, and would prefer that it come sooner rather than later," said Richard Carleton, chief executive of the Canadian Securities Exchange.\par \par \uc2 In all, there are 69 cannabis-related companies, representing a combined market value of about C$7.8 billion (U.S. $6.4 billion), trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the smaller \uc2 TSX Venture Exchange\uc2  and the \uc2 Canadian Securities Exchange\uc2 . These companies include more than a dozen fledgling U.S. marijuana entities that have turned to Canada to raise money, including 11 companies on the \uc2 Canadian Securities Exchange\uc2  with some assets or operations in the U.S., according to Mr. Carleton. There are at least four on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the smaller \uc2 TSX Venture Exchange\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Cannabis companies that were eager to raise public funds in Canada to fuel expansion plans now face the possibility of new restrictions.\par \par \uc2 Canopy Growth Corp\uc2 . , a Smiths Falls, Ontario-based grower and seller of medical marijuana, is the world's largest publicly-traded cannabis company, with a market valuation of C$1.7 billion on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Chief Executive \uc2 Bruce Linton\uc2  said he has turned down opportunities to invest in the U.S. because of the uncertain legal repercussions back in Canada.\par \par \uc2 Regulatory clarity, Mr. Linton said, would be "one of the last check boxes" to get institutional investors engaged in the cannabis market. "When a sector works in an unclear way, serious capital pools avoid that sector," he said.\par \par \uc2 Even if trading in U.S. cannabis shares is allowed to continue on Canadian exchanges, most marijuana startups face an uphill battle to attract capital, given uncertainty over future regulations in Canada and continued illegal status in the U.S. "Many institutional investors wouldn't touch any of these firms with a 10-foot pole," said Michael Mayes, president of Quantum 9, a Chicago-based marijuana-business consultancy.\par \par \uc2 Canadian investment bank \uc2 Canaccord Genuity Group Inc\uc2 . said it is considering stepping in to provide clearinghouse services if TMX's Canadian Depository unit decides to stop processing trades of publicly-traded cannabis companies with U.S. exposure. Canaccord has raised about C$415 million of capital in the cannabis sector as an adviser and underwriter since January 2016.\par \par \uc2 "If CDS is to make a change to its policy on clearing trades in U.S. cannabis companies, then Canaccord will explore options for a solution," said Graham Saunders, Canaccord's head of capital markets origination.\par \par \uc2 However, setting up a clearinghouse system is likely to take the investment bank take several months given the technological requirements, even if the plan were to get approval from securities regulators.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 GSAM's Smart-Beta ETF Will Expand Price War\par \par \uc2 A planned smart-beta ETF from Goldman Sachs Asset Management with a management fee of 0.09%\u8212\'20\'14well below the management fees of other smart-beta ETFs aside from those sponsored by Vanguard\u8212\'20\'14expands the ETF price war beyond plain-vanilla ETFs, says Stephen Tu, senior analyst at Moody's.

That's because there are now fewer regulations to finish under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, thanks to the work of SEC chiefs who preceded him. The SEC might even be able to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-drop-pursuit-of-banker-ceo-pay-restrictions-1500590543"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 put the remaining Dodd-Frank requirements on the back burner}}}\uc2 , reflecting White House and congressional antipathy for the law.\par \par \uc2 So it's a bit surprising that his SEC is moving slowly so far. Mr. Clayton was sworn in May 4. It's been 133 days since then, and the commission has yet to vote on a proposed or final regulation. By comparison, the commission took 21 days to approve its first proposed rule after \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2 , Mr. Clayton's immediate predecessor, took over in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Going back to the start of the 21st century, only former Chairman Christopher Cox took as many as 50 days to obtain a commission vote on his first proposed or final rule. Like Mr. Clayton, Mr. Cox was appointed by a Republican president who favored less regulation of financial markets. But under two previous Republican SEC chairmen, William Donaldson and \uc2 Harvey Pitt\uc2 , the SEC issued a proposed or final rule within a month of taking over.\par \par \uc2 It's fair to observe that Mr. Clayton isn't rushing into new rules because he wants to make it easier, not more cumbersome, for companies to raise capital. He also doesn't seem to face any pressing demand by Republican congressional leaders or the White House to move faster. But under the laws that govern how regulatory agencies function, loosening requirements usually requires a commission vote. Even deregulation takes time.\par \par \uc2 An SEC spokesman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton has also moved slowly to fill out the commission's senior staff. He still hasn't named permanent directors for two divisions that Wall Street watches closely\u8212\'20\'14Trading and Markets, which oversees exchanges, and the Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations, which inspects regulated financial firms. His top choice to run Trading and Markets {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/itg-executive-jamie-selway-withdraws-as-candidate-for-top-regulatory-role-1504881936"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dropped out of consideration}}}\uc2  after he had been under review for several months.\par \par \uc2 The SEC chief could be waiting for two new commissioners to join before he gets started in earnest with regulatory changes. The White House has picked {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-to-nominate-hester-peirce-as-republican-sec-commissioner-1500417225"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Republican Hester Peirce}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-set-to-tap-columbia-law-professor-for-sec-on-friday-1504225067"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Democrat Robert Jackson}}}\uc2  to fill the vacancies. While both Ms. Peirce and Mr. Jackson are likely to be confirmed, the Senate could take weeks, if not longer, to do so.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton has proceeded cautiously to build and execute an agenda of his own. But the clock is ticking: If a Democrat is elected president in 2020, the SEC's chief is likely to step down. The agency also tends to do less around the time of congressional elections, which are coming up next year. At some point soon, key stakeholders will want to see action on what Mr. Clayton has primed them to expect.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Equifax Faces Bumpy Legal Terrain as Consumer Suits Mount\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-faces-bumpy-legal-terrain-as-consumer-suits-mount-1505342810"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Credit-reporting company Equifax Inc.}}}\uc2 , which last week suffered a massive data breach, could face a tougher challenge in court than other corporate giants that have dealt with the legal fallout of data breaches, according to legal experts.\par \par \uc2 Unlike earlier retailer hacks, such as those suffered by \uc2 Home Depot Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Target Corp\uc2 ., the Equifax breach is bigger in scope, potentially compromising the personal information\u8212\'20\'14including Social Security and driver's license numbers\u8212\'20\'14of roughly 143 million U.S. consumers.\par \par \uc2 Florida Is Short on Insurance Adjusters, and That Could Stall Recovery Efforts\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/florida-is-short-on-insurance-adjusters-and-that-could-stall-recovery-efforts-1505381401"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 After Irma, Florida residents are lacking}}}\uc2  in many necessities. One of the more frustrating is the paucity of insurance adjusters, which is threatening to anger policyholders and potentially delay the state's rebuilding efforts.\par \par \uc2 Many of the state's adjusters are 1,000 miles away, working on claims made after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/irmas-riches-30-000-for-a-few-days-of-work-1505381404"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  Irma's Riches: $30,000 for a Few Days of Work }}}\par \par \uc2 There's Never Been a Hotter Time to Freeze Your Credit\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/theres-never-been-a-hotter-time-to-freeze-your-credit-1505321727"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Until the Equifax Inc. hack}}}\uc2 , many consumers didn't know what a credit freeze was. Now, the credit-reporting company's massive data breach has people reaching for the tool, a move that could have a host of implications for both consumers and the financial industry.\par \par \uc2 A freeze typically prevents lenders from accessing a potential borrower's credit report, although it doesn't affect existing credit arrangements such as outstanding loans or cards. A freeze makes it unlikely a firm would immediately extend new financing, which, while helping prevent fraud could also slow legitimate business.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ive-frozen-my-credit-for-10-years-its-a-hassle-but-worth-it-1505330595"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  I've Frozen My Credit for 10 Years. It's a Hassle but Worth It. }}}\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: SEC Chairman Open to Softening Auditor Rule\par \par \uc2 SEC Chairman Jay Clayton suggests he's at least open to softening a long-contested rule that requires companies to have auditors evaluate their internal controls, the procedures they use to prevent financial errors or fraud. Supporters of the rule, part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, say it helps ensure companies are giving accurate numbers to investors. But business groups say the rule is too costly and burdensome for small companies, and the proposed Financial Choice Act pending in Congress would exempt many more companies from having to follow it. At a meeting of an SEC advisory panel that discussed the issue, Clayton says, "To get to a good audit you have to have good controls, but the devil is in the details, and we should be exploring them."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: SEC Chairman Suggests the Midwest Could Use a Few More VCs\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chairman-suggests-the-midwest-could-use-a-few-more-vcs-1505339087"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Memo to venture capitalists}}}\uc2 : the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  wants to know why you don't have an Indianapolis branch office.\par \par \uc2 Jay Clayton, the SEC's chairman appointed by the Trump administration, asked on Wednesday why the Midwest has so few venture capitalists even though the region hosts so many large, established companies. "Over 100 Fortune 500 companies\u8212\'20\'14but only 4% of U.S. venture funds," Mr. Clayton said at a meeting of the SEC's small business advisory committee. "It doesn't make sense you would have that robust an economy and so few people looking toward the future."\par \par \uc2 Foreign Investors Snap Up Chinese Bank Debt\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-investors-snap-up-chinese-bank-debt-1505280977"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Foreign investors last month more than tripled}}}\uc2  their holdings of a popular short-term debt instrument issued by Chinese banks\u8212\'20\'14reflecting both the attraction of a rising yuan and a growing risk appetite.\par \par \uc2 That made them among the leading buyers of "negotiable certificates of deposit" or NCDs in August, a rare position for foreign investors in any Chinese debt market. Central banks and sovereign-wealth funds were big buyers, according to a Shanghai-based banker at a global bank that trades on behalf of such foreign investors.\par \par \uc2 NCDs\u8212\'20\'14effectively high-yielding bonds, generally with maturities of a month to a year\u8212\'20\'14have become extremely popular with Chinese banks, especially smaller lenders, since their launch in late 2013. But as concerns have grown that banks are issuing them as a tool for leveraged investment rather than to meet genuine refinancing needs, they have drawn heightened scrutiny from Chinese regulators, who recently imposed a partial ban.\par \par \uc2 Canadian Exchange Weighs Risks in Trading U.S. Marijuana Stocks\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-exchange-weighs-risks-in-trading-u-s-marijuana-stocks-1505316645"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 As dozens of cannabis companies have flocked}}}\uc2  to raise capital on Canada's stock exchanges in recent years, the country's regulators are starting to question whether trading in their stock would run afoul of U.S. law.\par \par \uc2 The parent company of the Toronto Stock Exchange and an umbrella organization of Canadian securities regulators are looking at cannabis companies with U.S. operations\u8212\'20\'14including growers, medical-marijuana distributors and pharmaceutical firms whose products include marijuana ingredients\u8212\'20\'14to determine whether trading in their shares should be allowed to continue on Canadian exchanges.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-talk-daily-analysis-roundup-1505337141"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Read our compilation of concise, timely analysis}}}\uc2  by Wall Street Journal reporters. \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 's Smart-Beta ETF Will Expand Price War; Equifax Continues Slide; Harvey More Costly than Irma, Says Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\par \par \uc2 China's Next Debt Addiction: Credit Cards\par \par \uc2 China's rapid shift toward mobile payments has led some to assume the country would somehow bypass credit cards on the way to becoming a cashless society. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-next-debt-addictioncredit-cards-1505296621"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The latest figures suggest otherwise:}}}\uc2  Credit card loans in China rose 31% on year to almost 4.69 trillion yuan ($718 billion) in the second quarter, according to central bank data.\par \par \uc2 The stars have actually been aligning for the Chinese credit-card industry. Banks want to hand more of them out, while consumer confidence is off the charts. Beijing, meanwhile, is eager to shift more of China's monumental debt pile onto households\u8212\'20\'14which traditionally have high savings\u8212\'20\'14and away from the highly indebted corporate sector.\par \par \uc2 The big enablers have been China's so-called joint-stock banks, which are usually midsize lenders. Interest and fees related to credit cards accounted for 20% of their total revenue in the first half, on average, according to \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  analysts. Banks are eager to find new income streams, as regulatory pressure on their lucrative shadow lending intensifies.\par \par \uc2 Thursday, Sept. 14\par \par \uc2 9 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Bill Huizenga, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee's subpanel on capital markets, speaks at the Security Traders Association {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://securitytraders.org/2017-conference/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Market Structure Conference}}}\uc2  in Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 9:30 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Finra CEO Robert Cook speaks at 9:30 a.m. at the Security Traders Association conference.\par \par \uc2 Monday, Sept. 18\par \par \uc2 NA\par \par \uc2 CFTC Chairman J.

Researchers from the \uc2 Tokyo Institute of Technology\uc2  found that those managers who are closely monitored by institutional investors and independent directors tend to be active in making difficult decisions.

"Outrage that Equifax exposed more than 143 million credit records to identity thieves misses the point," he writes. "We really should worry about what makes impersonation so easy\u8212\'20\'14why do lenders know so little about the people to whom they issue credit?"\par \par \uc2 Bank-Risk Measures Overcompensate for Calm Markets\par \par \uc2 Bank risk as measured by "value at risk" has declined sharply since 2009, but that gauge may belie the actual risk in the market, Mark Whitehouse {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-11/how-much-have-banks-really-cut-their-risks"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 writes for BloombergView}}}\uc2 . Value at risk measures how much a firm could lose on a given day based on the recent past, so calmer markets will show up as less risk even if a bank's assets haven't changed, he says. Adjusted to strip out the impact of the broader market, trading operations at the six largest U.S. banks are only about 25% less risky than they were in 2009, and have actually become a bit riskier over the past year, Mr. Whitehouse says. Lending is inherently risky, he says, but banks "don't have enough equity to absorb the inevitable losses from bad bets, and they're still taking plenty of risk in areas\u8212\'20\'14such as the trading book\u8212\'20\'14where they should be safer."\par \par \uc2 Stanley Fischer's Departure Reveals Weakness at the Fed\par \par \uc2 With Stanley Fischer set to resign from the \uc2 Federal Reserve Board of Governors\uc2 , \uc2 Adam S.

Chair \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  may take a similar view in the wake of the twin storms that hit Texas and Florida.\par \par \uc2 Estimates from Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  put the total physical damage from Harvey and Irma at $150bn-$200bn - comparable to that following Katrina. The hit to annualised gross domestic product growth in the third quarter may be 0.5 percentage points, it said. Separate estimates from \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  suggest the hurricane-related disruptions will shave as much as 0.8 percentage points from growth during that period, lowering the likely expansion to 2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Conversely, headline inflation could briefly spike in the aftermath of the storms, driven by factors such as higher petrol prices following refinery shutdowns, as well as an uplift in used car prices after the storms left a trail of ruined vehicles. The impact on core inflation - which strips out food and fuel prices and is closely watched by the Fed - may be more muted.\par \par \uc2 Analysts stress that big disasters can lift growth further out as the rebuilding effort gets under way, leaving the overall economy on largely the same longer-term trajectory. That was the message from \uc2 Bill Dudley\uc2 , New York Fed president last week, when he described the national economic effects of epic storms as "modest and transitory". Stormrelated turmoil could make it hard to read the economic data given the volatility it will insert into numbers, he said.\par \par \uc2 Michael Feroli of \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  does not expect Fed policy to be heavily affected. At next week's meeting it is still likely to announce the start to the process of reducing its balance sheet; it has not been making this move contingent on near-term swings in economic data.\par \par \uc2 "The next realistic chance to adjust the funds rate is not until mid-December, and at that point we think some of the more noticeable disruptions from the data flow should be behind us," added Mr Feroli.\par \par \uc2 None of this is to play down the short-term impact from two such violent storms. Harvey has triggered a surge in claims for unemployment benefits in Texas, for instance. Initial claims rose by 62,000 to a seasonally adjusted 298,000 in the week ended September 2, the biggest weekly jump since 2012, according to the Labor Department. In 2005 there were more than 500,000 hurricane-related jobless claims over three months following Katrina, according to High Frequency Economics.\par \par \uc2 Industrial production is likely to be dented by shutdowns in Texas's chemicals and petroleum sector. Power outages have affected more than half the homes and businesses in Florida, hitting utilities' output and business activity. The state's tourism sector has been particularly exposed to the storm's effects.\par \par \uc2 In addition, it may take time for rebuilding to get under way - especially in two states where there are shortages of construction labour. This could mean wages in the sector are boosted.\par \par \uc2 Goldman predicts the third-quarter hit from the two storms will be more than recouped over the subsequent three quarters as business investment and construction activity rallies. "You get an initial negative impact that is made up in subsequent months and quarters, and it washes out very quickly," said Mark Zandi of Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "It should not have any material impact on monetary policy."\par \par \uc2 That does not necessarily mean the job of interpreting the coming weeks' data will be easy for the Fed. Inflation readings will probably be hit by the storms, at a time when the central bank is sensitive to fluctuations in prices.\par \par \uc2 D isappointments on inflation readings have left the Fed's interest-rate decisions finely balanced, with many investors doubting the central bank will be able to lift rates by another quarter-point by the end of the year. Greater clarity will come next Wednesday, when Ms Yellen gives a press conference after the central bank's latest meeting.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170913ed9d0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Ric Edelman\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Founder and executive chairman of \uc2 Edelman Financial Services\uc2 , Fairfax, Va. \u8226\'20\'22 Education: B.A., Honorary Ph.D. Rowan University \u8226\'20\'22 Professional Designations: Board Certified in Mutual Funds, Certified Fund Specialist, Chartered Mutual Fund Counselor, Certified Retirement Counselor, Qualified Financial Planner, Registered Financial Consultant\par \par \uc2 Background: Mr. Edelman, a best-selling author and a television and radio personality, began his career as a journalist covering financial issues in the 1980s. When Mr. Edelman and his wife hired a financial adviser who prompted them to lie on their mortgage application to qualify for a home loan, they were shocked. After their surprise ebbed, they felt inspired. "We thought, 'If this guy can make a living as an adviser giving people harmful advice, could we make a living giving someone helpful advice?' " Mr. Edelman says. He and his wife launched their own firm in 1986.\par \par \uc2 His practice: Mr. Edelman's practice currently serves over 34,000 clients, providing financial-planning services to anyone with at least $5,000 to invest. Mr. Edelman specializes in educating clients about how technology will affect their financial future. He says that rapidly advancing exponential technologies\u8212\'20\'14such as robotics, 3D printing and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14will significantly increase the human life span, alter career paths, and put an end to traditional retirement.\par \par \uc2 The biggest challenge facing the advising industry: Mr. Edelman says most advisers aren't prepared for this type of longevity that will come with advances in medicine, neuroscience and robotics. "The typical adviser is using outdated financial-planning software that assumes their clients will live to 90 or 95," says Mr. Edelman. He says that this gap could put clients in serious financial jeopardy as they outlive their savings.\par \par \uc2 On helping clients prepare for change: Mr. Edelman takes a two-part approach to assisting his clients succeed financially in a rapidly changing world. The first step is exposing clients to information about exponential technologies and how it will affect their lives. The second is to provide them with investing opportunities that align with technological growth. Mr. Edelman has played a part in building such investment vehicles. In 2014, he worked with \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  and Blackrock to develop \uc2 iShares Exponential Technologies ETF\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Advisers as career counselors: Mr. Edelman says that technology will eliminate many jobs, making it necessary for workers to be retrained in new industries. He says advisers will need to incorporate career counseling and planning into their practices and help clients plan to save money for additional education.\par \par \uc2 On games of strategy and advising: In his spare time, Mr. Edelman enjoys playing games of strategy such as pool, hearts and chess. His work and the games he enjoys are similar, he says. "It's all the strategic anticipation of what will happen next."\par \par \uc2 His proudest professional achievement\u8230\'20\'26 "Having been named by Barron's 3 times as No. 1 independent financial adviser," he says.\par \par \uc2 Compiled by Lynn Shattuck\par \par \uc2 More Adviser Profiles\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-focus-on-women-in-transition-1504723170?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Kimberly Foss, founder of Empyrion Wealth Management }}}\uc2 (Sept. 6, 2017)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/delivering-comprehensive-wealth-management-1504101602?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jimmy Lee, chief executive of Wealth Consulting Group}}}\uc2  (Aug. 30, 2017)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/key-to-advisory-firm-success-retaining-advisers-1503499508?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Andy Schwartz, managing partner of Bleakley Financial Group}}}\uc2  (Aug. 23, 2017)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/helping-clients-meet-retirement-goals-1502978575?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of individual investor group at D.A.

That's credit-negative for traditional active-equity players entering the smart-beta realm, including \uc2 Legg Mason\uc2  (LM), \uc2 Franklin Resources\uc2  (BEN) and \uc2 Janus Capital\uc2  (JNS), he says. It's also credit-negative for the existing smart-beta managers, including Invesco (IVZ), \uc2 BlackRock (BLK)\uc2 , State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF), who are likely to respond with price cuts on existing products, Tu says. Thus far, most smart-beta ETFs have been priced between 24 basis points and 39 basis points, he says. BLK, STT and WETF didn't have an immediate comment. IVZ didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  Continues Slide As Data-Breach Complaints Mount\par \par \uc2 Shares in \uc2 Equifax\uc2  (EFX) are down 12% to $101.71 as the credit-reporting company continues to get scrutiny from customers, competitors, investors and lawmakers over the massive data breach it revealed last week. In an op-ed published in USA Today, CEO \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  apologized for the breach impacting 143 million US consumers and added it has been the "most humbling moment" in its history. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Sen Heidi Heitkamp (D, ND) has called for federal agencies to investigate whether top executives sold shares based on knowledge about the hack prior to Thursday's public announcement. The company has denied any wrongdoing. EFX had gained 21% this year prior to Friday, but shares are now down more than 13% this year, shaving off about $4.8 billion in value from the company.

Harvey cost the economy between $86 billion and $108 billion, with median estimate of $97 billion, Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  says. Irma cost between $58 billion and $83 billion, with a median estimate of $70.5 billion. Harvey was seen as causing significantly more damage to residential and commercial property, making it a more costly storm, the analysis showed. However, Irma caused slightly more loss of economic output. A larger number of people evacuated ahead of Irma and still millions in the Southeast are without power.

Now it's welcoming the big money back in. \uc2 GS\uc2  has raised the maximum account size from $250,000 to $1 million for its online accounts, which pay 1.2% a year, one of the best rates out there. Growing deposits has been a key goal, especially as \uc2 GS\uc2  looks to lower its overall cost of funding\u8212\'20\'14a boon to its traders\u8212\'20\'14and ramp up its lending activity. \uc2 GS\uc2  has $15 billion in retail deposits, according to an investor presentation this week. (liz.hoffman@wsj.com; @lizrhoffman)\par \par \uc2 New Irma Damage Estimate: $25B\par \par \uc2 Hurricane Irma caused $18 billion in insured losses in the US and $7 billion in the Caribbean, according to the latest estimates from catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Co. The estimates do not include crop losses or damage that is insured by the National Flood Insurance Program. In the Caribbean, half the property damage was in St. Martin, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, the company says. In the U.S., most of the devastation was in the Florida Keys, but Jacksonville and Charleston also experienced "significant inland flooding." (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)\par \par \uc2 Tax Reform Hopes Vanish from Bank Stocks\par \par \uc2 Bank stocks have recently underperformed assets that the group tends to be tied to, evidence that "investors are pricing in a very low probability of significant regulatory or tax reform," \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  analysts write. Bank stocks tend to be linked to assets like interest rates, fixed income, the dollar, and the stock market. But after the election, bank stocks outperformed these assets by 12% as traders forecast a greater chance of policy changes, says \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , adding that the entire financial sector has been volatile since the election. The firm benchmarked returns of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index with funds tracking the S&P 500, Treasurys, high yield bonds, gold and oil. "The Trump premium has drained out of banks," the analysts write. (gunjan.banerji@wsj.com; @gunjanjs)\par \par \uc2 SBI Life IPO to Raise Over $1 Billion\par \par \uc2 SBI Life Insurance\uc2 , one of India's top life insurers, will raise as much as INR84 billion ($1.3 billion) in its initial share sale offer next week. This will be the largest IPO in the past seven years, after \uc2 Coal India\uc2 . The price band for the offer is fixed between INR 685-INR 700 a share and it will open on September 20. SBI Life is the second life insurer to be listed on the stock exchange. Last year, the country's largest private life insurer ICICI Prudential Life Insurance was listed. Many life insurance firms are coming out to list their shares to take advantage of a buoyant stock market and also due to regulatory requirements.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Good morning. I'm filling in for Lara today and will do my best with the music puns. It was a big day for media and technology executives out on the scene. Apple held its highly anticipated product launch event marking the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone. The buzziest announcement {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-unveils-new-products-at-iphone-event-1505238436"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 was the launch of the iPhone X}}}\uc2 , which will cost $999, and come loaded with facial-recognition and augmented reality features. Also noteworthy was an animated poo emoji, as Reuters reporter Stephen Nellis {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/StephenNellis/status/907675971859263489"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tweeted}}}\uc2 . Meanwhile, buttoned-up executives from top media, marketing and technology firms made their case for change at the kickoff of \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 ' Communacopia conference, and the advertising technology conference DMexco begins Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Whole Lotta Cord Cutting\par \par \uc2 On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that two media agencies downgraded their forecasts for global ad spending. Now \uc2 eMarketer\uc2  has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.emarketer.com/Article/eMarketer-Lowers-US-TV-Ad-Spend-Estimate-Cord-Cutting-Accelerates/1016463"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reduced its estimate }}}\uc2 for U.S. TV ad spending due to "faster-than-expected growth in cord-cutting" and the corresponding audience shrinkage. The research firm predicts there will be over 22 million cord-cutters this year, up 33% over last year and a big step-up from its earlier estimate of 15.4 million. Consumer attention is shifting to new "over the top" streaming services. The average time spent watching TV (excluding digital) among U.S. adults will drop 3.1% to 3 hours 58 minutes this year, while consumption of digital video will increase 9.3% to 1 hour 17 minutes, according to the report. As a result, this year, \uc2 eMarketer\uc2  predicts U.S. TV ad spending will increase 0.5% to $71.65 billion -- down from the $72.72 billion it estimated in its first quarter forecast. TV's share of total media ad spending in the U.S. will drop from 36.6% last year to 34.9% this year, and will go below 30% by 2021.\par \par \uc2 You've Gotta Give For What You Take\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2 's "first click free" program has become a headache for some subscription-based news publishers, including The Wall Street Journal. It lets people access stories via search results even if they aren't subscribers, and publishers who don't participate can find their sites penalized in the search rankings. Now {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-offers-olive-branch-to-publishers-by-relaxing-policy-on-subscription-sites-1505259211"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Google is ending the policy}}}\uc2 , report WSJ's Jack Nicas and Lukas Alpert. \uc2 Robert Thomson\uc2 , CEO of WSJ-parent News Corp, let out the news at the \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  media conference Tuesday. Subscription-oriented publishers will now be able to take whatever approach they want -- you can give away sample stories if you so desire, but if you opt to keep a strict paywall (zero free rides), as the Journal has done lately, you won't be penalized in the search results. That's due to an algorithm tweak that allows \uc2 Google\uc2  to scan entire news stories, not just the portions that are beyond the paywall. This represents a significant rapprochement after \uc2 Google\uc2  and publishers have sparred over a variety of issues. We'll see if the good vibes last.\par \par \uc2 I Like \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and I Cannot Lie\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere at the Goldman conference, the "it's all about data" theme kept surfacing. AT&T CEO \uc2 Randall Stephenson\uc2  used his time to tout the benefits of targeted advertising. \uc2 AT&T\uc2  is "building an advertising capability" for more precise ad targeting, he said. He said he expects the company's acquisition of \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-to-give-free-hbo-to-more-wireless-customers-1505226248"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 yield new revenue}}}\uc2  from advertising, and added that \uc2 AT&T\uc2  could use data on viewing habits to select what shows and movies to invest in, reports WSJ. Later in the morning, Comcast CEO \uc2 Brian Roberts\uc2  urged marketers to use the company's \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to inform their ad-buying, rather than relying only on Nielsen data, WSJ's Imani Moise reports. And he talked down the value of targeted ads on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . On the content front, Netflix CFO \uc2 David Wells\uc2  said the company would pay $20 million an hour for a show if the circumstances were right (wow), WSJ's Joe Flint reports. And at a time when \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  are angling into live sports, Mr. Wells said \uc2 Netflix\uc2  has no plans to.\par \par \uc2 'Duopoly' Blues\par \par \uc2 Winning the eyebrow-raising award at the Goldman conference was WPP CEO \uc2 Martin Sorrell\uc2 , who referenced former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon to make a point about digital media giants \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . He said: "I have no great truck for Steve Bannon, but before Bannon left for the White House he did say, '\uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  are utilities.' And he implied that utilities should be regulated." He appeared to be referring to remarks {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://theintercept.com/2017/07/27/steve-bannon-wants-facebook-and-google-regulated-like-utilities/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cited in this article}}}\uc2 . We're not sure if Mr. Sorrell was making the case for heightened regulation of \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , or just opening it up for debate. What is clear is that no matter how Mr. Sorrell feels about the digital giants he refers to as "frenemies," \uc2 WPP\uc2  will continue to increase its spending with the companies. In his speech, Mr. Sorrell said that \uc2 WPP\uc2 's spending with \uc2 Google\uc2  will increase to $5.5 billion in 2017, from $5 billion last year, and spending with \uc2 Facebook\uc2  will get a boost from $1.7 billion to around $2.5 billion. In other \uc2 WPP\uc2  news, Mr. Sorrell said the company will be changing its regional management approach and encouraging more integration on shared client work across agencies.\par \par \uc2 Best of the Rest\par \par \uc2 21st Century Fox Inc\uc2 .'s $15.5 billion proposal to consolidate ownership of \uc2 Sky\uc2  hit a new hurdle as the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  said it would likely broaden its review to include \uc2 Fox\uc2 's commitment to the country's broadcasting standards.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Banks and other financial companies are considering the possibility of moving some business away from \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . in the wake of its data breach and to some of the firm's credit-reporting rivals, according to people familiar with the firms.\par \par \uc2 Lenders are unlikely to take any immediate action and are seeking more information from \uc2 Equifax\uc2  about the hack that exposed sensitive personal financial information about potentially 143 million Americans. Still, large banks, in particular, have expressed dismay privately that their customers' information was compromised, that they received no advance warning of the breach announcement, and that they still have little insight into what went wrong, these people said.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  has already faced widespread criticism from consumers. In the aftermath of the breach disclosure many consumers said they struggled with the firm's website and policies.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  is also facing political ire: Two congressional committees are planning hearings into the hack, and the Senate Finance Committee on Monday sent the company a list of requests for information about the attack, the company's response to it, and who knew what and when about the problem.\par \par \uc2 Executives at financial firms in recent days have publicly expressed concern about the breach. \uc2 James Dimon\uc2 , chief executive officer of \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, spoke about \uc2 Equifax\uc2  twice at conferences on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dimon said he is interested in understanding more about whether the hack is the sort of attack that could have happened to any company or if there was something specific that \uc2 Equifax\uc2  didn't do correctly. "All that will matter, it's obviously important," he said.\par \par \uc2 He also said, "It depends what happened and how it happened, whether they could've or should've." Mr. Dimon said that the bank was in contact with \uc2 Equifax\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Speaking at a conference the day before, Capital One Financial Corp. CEO Richard Fairbank said the cost of the attack would be borne by both consumers and financial companies. "A bunch of our customers are affected," he said. "It's going to be costly to them and to us."\par \par \uc2 It is unlikely that financial firms would cease doing business with \uc2 Equifax\uc2  altogether. But, as contracts with the company come up for renewal, they might look to shift some of their business to rivals such as \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  or \uc2 Experian PLC\uc2 , the people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 For most loans, excluding mortgages, lenders often don't check credit reports from all three big credit-reporting firms. Moving away from \uc2 Equifax\uc2  would likely result in more market share to \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  and \uc2 Experian\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The possibility of losing market share could add to the pressure on \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , which is already facing lawsuits and investigations related to the breach. The company's stock has fallen nearly 20% since just before the hack was announced last week.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170913000115"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170913ed9d0002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . data breach could force some lenders to hit the brakes.\par \par \uc2 Lenders and data providers said that in the wake of the breach {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 announced by Equifax last week}}}\uc2 , they are evaluating procedures for confirming a potential borrower's identity. Equifax, like other credit-reporting companies, played a big role in helping these firms verify borrowers' identities, selling them access to a database that could quickly match up a person's identifying information.\par \par \uc2 Unlike traditional banks, which may lend to people who walk into a branch, or to customers they know well through checking accounts or other products, newer online lenders take applications from unknown people, entirely online.\par \par \uc2 To compete with banks, firms such as \uc2 LendingClub Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Kabbage Inc\uc2 . often promise near-instant approval for online personal or small-business loans, and make it easy to submit applications online or even through a mobile app. Some firms, like \uc2 Quicken Loans Inc\uc2 .'s Rocket Mortgage, even offer the same for home loans.\par \par \uc2 To offer such speedy access, one measure used by many lenders is to check customers' submitted Social Security numbers and other personal information against databases owned by Equifax and peers TransUnion and \uc2 Experian PLC\uc2 . If the data match up, the person is likely who they say they are.\par \par \uc2 Such a check is relatively inexpensive, roughly 5 cents to 50 cents per application, according to lenders. The price is low because such databases are well established and don't involve sophisticated analysis, and are effective enough in catching more blatant fraud attempts.\par \par \uc2 Now, however, those checks could become less effective in weeding out someone putting in a loan application with a false identity. The Equifax breach compromised personal identification data {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-customer-complaints-continue-to-pile-up-1505080789"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 for potentially 143 million Americans}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14exposing names, dates of birth, addresses and Social Security numbers. In some cases, drivers' license data may have also been exposed.\par \par \uc2 "Most banks and many financial technology companies rely on drivers' license validation or Social Security validation," said Zach Perret, chief executive of Plaid Technologies Inc., which connects companies to bank data for transacting and verification. "It will be hard to rely on them to verify identities going forward."\par \par \uc2 The complexity for these lenders is that updating procedures can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming. Tools such as verifying images of a driver's license or using a phone's thumbprint reader can cost as much as $10 per application, lenders say. Firms also have added steps such as making small deposits in a borrower's bank account, and verifying them, before making a loan.\par \par \uc2 "There are some really great tools out there, but the industry today mostly uses older [identification] methodologies," Mr. Perret said. "Even though we know that 143 million peoples' data has been compromised, it could still take years for the industry to catch up and move to new identity validation standards."\par \par \uc2 LendingClub\uc2  and Kabbage said they have previously incorporated tools beyond credit bureaus into their verification methods and were monitoring fraud rates for any sign of uptick. Quicken Loans declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Dave Girouard, CEO of online lender Upstart Network Inc., said that as a rule of thumb, each additional document a company asks a borrower to produce reduces completed applications by 15%.\par \par \uc2 Upstart does verify borrowers' income information, which it says weeds out more bad loans, and is on balance worth the cost. It also asks for information such as where a person went to school and verifies bank accounts.\par \par \uc2 These tools can be relatively expensive, and some customers may not want to give up that information. But Mr. Girouard said the extra steps have curtailed fraud.\par \par \uc2 Lenders' profit margin from making a loan, which then tends to be sold on to investors, tends to be thin to begin with. And for every loan they make, lenders turn down hundreds or thousands of applicants. Identify verification, which helps to reduce fraud and fulfills regulatory obligations to know who you are lending to, is a big part of the cost of lending.\par \par \uc2 Plus, asking for more information\u8212\'20\'14perhaps the easiest way to update security procedures\u8212\'20\'14can discourage some legitimate borrowers.\par \par \uc2 Scott Carter, CEO of ID \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  LLC, said that while larger lenders already tend to use more advanced methods for verifying identity, many firms may now need to invest in new systems.\par \par \uc2 "Smaller lenders with less volume can be less sophisticated in their fraud practices and this can impact their exposure to new fraud threats," he said. "But there are exceptions. There are a few small lenders that are very sophisticated and a few large ones that aren't."\par \par \uc2 Some lenders said they breathed a sigh of relief that the Equifax breach didn't extend to deeper data about customers, such as their detailed history of things like prior addresses or credit amounts outstanding. They also said that past breaches have already made them wary of basic identifying information.\par \par \uc2 One executive of a company that works with several lenders on verification, including some that use Equifax, said theft of detailed credit histories\u8212\'20\'14specific details of a person's borrowings and credit cards, for example\u8212\'20\'14would have been far worse than what occurred, the "nuclear weapon" of credit fraud. In that case, even lenders using more advanced steps, like testing whether a borrower can pick out an address where they have never lived, would be compromised.\par \par \uc2 "When I first saw [the Equifax headline], my heart sank," he said. "There would be no way to tell when identity theft occurs."\par \par \uc2 Still, because the stolen data included Social Security numbers, driver's licenses and other identifying information, lenders said the breach was more dangerous than, say, thefts of credit-card numbers. Those can be changed and aren't used to confirm borrower identity.\par \par \uc2 So even firms that aren't Equifax clients are weighing whether they need to make changes.\par \par \uc2 "We immediately started looking at alternatives, to ensure that we're ready to handle what may come right now," said Krishna Gopinathan, CEO of Applied Data Finance, an online lending credit-analysis firm that doesn't use Equifax for identity verification.\par \par \uc2 Write to Telis Demos at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:telis.demos@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 telis.demos@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170911ed9b000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Backers of the bureau have already found a solid example in the phony-accounts scandal at \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargos-year-of-scandal-stretches-on-1504863001"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 continues to expand in scope}}}\uc2  a year after the CFPB and other regulators punished the company.\par \par \uc2 The Equifax news could {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-hack-likely-to-scramble-deregulatory-efforts-1504898734"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 scuttle new efforts by Republican lawmakers to ease penalties for credit-reporting firms}}}\uc2  accused of harming consumers with inaccurate credit reports. The CFPB said the bureau was looking into the data breach, and the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2 , as well as some congressional panels, have started their own probes.\par \par \uc2 In addition to reigniting a broad discussion about the CFPB's role, Equifax's response to the hack gave consumer advocates an opportunity to argue for the importance of the new arbitration rule, which some Republican lawmakers want to overturn. The rule will make it easier for consumers to band together to sue financial-services companies by banning clauses in contracts that lock consumers into going into arbitration to resolve disputes.\par \par \uc2 After disclosing the data breach, Equifax offered a free one-year credit-report monitoring service to affected consumers. But angry responses soon started flying in: People complained the service required its users to waive their right to sue Equifax.\par \par \uc2 "This is one more reminder why @CFPB rule blocking forced arbitration is so important to protect the rights of working Americans," tweeted Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio). "The @CFPB's new rule would stop companies like @Equifax from avoiding legal accountability like this\u8212\'20\'14as long as @GOP doesn't reverse it," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a close CFPB ally, said in her tweet.\par \par \uc2 New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, also a Democrat, said in a tweet that the company's language forcing customers with disputes into arbitration, rather than suing the company, "unacceptable and unenforceable." He said his office has demanded that Equifax remove the language.\par \par \uc2 Equifax said late Friday that the arbitration clause and class-action waiver don't apply to the hack.\par \par \uc2 The reactions from Democratic officials come as GOP lawmakers in the Senate accelerate their efforts to thwart the arbitration rule, finalized in July, using a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act. While House Republican overwhelmingly voted to support their version of the bill, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-effort-to-overturn-arbitration-rule-at-risk-from-republican-defectors-1502020803"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a few GOP senators are seen as sitting on the fence}}}\uc2 , making them the target of intense lobbying efforts.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Equifax Customer Complaints Continue to Pile Up\par \par \uc2 By AnnaMaria Andriotis\par \par \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . struggled over the weekend with its response to its massive data breach as consumers continued to criticize the credit-reporting company's efforts and cited ongoing problems with a website set up to help them.\par \par \uc2 Regulators, meanwhile, are urging consumers to freeze their credit reports, a move some lenders fear could ding credit growth even as the finance industry struggles with the question of how to contain the potential for widespread fraud that could affect millions of Americans.\par \par \uc2 Despite Equifax's statement Friday evening that it had cleaned up many of the problems on its website, consumers said they were still receiving erroneous and confusing responses. Some said they made up fake last names and social security numbers and received responses from the site that suggest it didn't recognize they were fictitious identities.\par \par \uc2 The issues add to consumer ire over the data breach, which has exposed vital personal identification data\u8212\'20\'14including social security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth\u8212\'20\'14of potentially as many as 143 million Americans. The hack is second in size to only one that was disclosed by \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  last year but potentially the most dangerous to date given the vital gatekeeper role firms such as Equifax play in terms of consumer credit and people's personal information.\par \par \uc2 Kris Rockwell of Atlanta, Georgia on Sunday morning said she went to Equifax's website and entered random letters from the alphabet in the name field and all zeros in the social security number field. The response was that she "probably ha[d] been hacked," she said in an email. "Are they kidding us?"\par \par \uc2 Some consumers trying to visit the site also received a warning message that "attackers might be trying to steal [their] information from the website." That raised further concerns for already jittery consumers.\par \par \uc2 An Equifax spokesman said that the data file "likely contains a very limited number of names and numbers that do not connect to real people. But to reiterate, the key point is that every person potentially impacted is in the file."\par \par \uc2 Some consumers will be receiving letters in the mail from Equifax informing them that they have likely been impacted by the breach.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, authorities were urging consumers to do more than sign up for the free credit-monitoring service now being offered by Equifax. The office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent an email to state residents Saturday telling them to consider placing a freeze on their credit reports. The email said it would make it harder for someone to open a new account in their name. It added that tax identity fraud was a possible result of the Equifax hack since social security numbers were compromised. Similarly, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's office issued a release on Friday recommending, among other things, that consumers contact each of the main credit-reporting firms to freeze their credit reports.\par \par \uc2 Equifax's offer of the free one-year credit monitoring service includes freezing people's credit reports at their firm but not elsewhere. Consumers would have to contact other firms on their own.\par \par \uc2 Credit freezes prevent lenders from being able to get copies of prospective customer's credit reports. That prevents swindlers from opening credit cards or other loans but also places that same limit on the legitimate customers unless they undo the freeze, says credit specialist John Ulzheimer.\par \par \uc2 For lenders, though, the prospect of millions of Americans freezing their credit raises the possibility of a crimp in lending. That could dent profits at some firms and, if the issue became widespread enough, could hamper economic growth.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, lenders have to deal with the data breach and the possibility it raises of widespread fraud. Banks and other lenders stand to incur losses on fraudulent loans and credit cards opened in consumers names with data pilfered from Equifax.\par \par \uc2 "There will be some impact on lending over time, but the more immediate challenge facing financial institutions is authentication," meaning making sure that the people who apply for loans and those using existing accounts are who they say they are, said a credit card executive at a large bank.\par \par \uc2 Credit specialists are stumped as to how the cleanup process will work here. In most cases, credit-reporting firms aren't in a position to validate whether a loan application is legitimate. That is the responsibility of the lender receiving the application, who relies on the files at credit-reporting companies to help determine whether the loan applicant is creditworthy.\par \par \uc2 Major lenders typically add information to credit reports when consumers apply for credit and if they receive loans. When fraudulent activity has been added to those reports, consumers as well as lenders need to get involved to inform the credit-reporting companies that the accounts are fraudulent.\par \par \uc2 Banks for decades have relied on credit-reporting firms as a key source of verifying consumers' identities to issue credit to them. While Equifax has said that the consumer credit reports weren't involved in the breach, the pieces of information that were stolen are enough in many cases for swindlers to open accounts in other people's names.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, if swindlers open up payday loans or loans from other nonmainstream lenders, those won't end up on the credit reports with the big three credit bureaus. That could make it more difficult to spot future fraud by effectively creating a shadow type of loan that consumers would be unaware of, even if they check their credit reports. In many cases consumers would only find out when lenders or collection firms contacted them.\par \par \uc2 Reinsurers Will Largely Be Writing the Checks to Pay for Irma Damage\par \par \uc2 By Leslie Scism\par \par \uc2 A global array of reinsurance companies will bear the financial brunt of Hurricane Irma's damage to potentially millions of homes across Florida.\par \par \uc2 Irma's winds are expected to leave tens of billions of dollars in insured damage. And when the insurance money arrives for many homeowners, much of it will be via reinsurance companies\u8212\'20\'14not the carrier on their contract.\par \par \uc2 Reinsurers play an especially large role in Florida's home-insurance market.\par \par \uc2 Andrew, Katrina and other severe hurricanes from 1992 through 2005 devastated the state's insurance marketplace. Most brand-name national home insurers sharply reduced their presence. Picking up the slack today is a state-run "insurer of last resort," \uc2 Citizens Property Insurance Corp\uc2 ., and some 50 small to midsize home insurers.\par \par \uc2 Those carriers all are required to buy ample amounts of reinsurance to help ensure they have money for their policyholders, because they don't have the fat capital cushions of the national carriers. These reinsurance firms are specialty insurers that take on the risk of some of the policies sold by primary insurers. They send insurers money to help pay claims once claims reach contractual, designated levels.\par \par \uc2 As a result, the reinsurers "might end up holding the bag" for much of Irma's damage to residential properties, said Taoufik Gharib, a senior director at Standard & Poor's Global Ratings.\par \par \uc2 In addition to reinsurance, the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2 's National Flood Insurance Program will face payouts to those homeowners who hold its policies. Under standard homeowners contracts, insurers cover wind damage but exclude flooding. Much of Irma's damage is expected to come from storm surge.\par \par \uc2 The use of so much reinsurance introduces a few worries into the marketplace. The home insurers are exposed to potential disputes with their reinsurers over claims payments, industry analysts note. It also ties the home insurers' fates to the financial health of their reinsurers.\par \par \uc2 Irma's arrival is well-timed from one perspective: The global reinsurance industry is awash in capital. As of March, it had a record $605 billion capital cushion, which was built up thanks in large part to relatively few major natural disasters in the U.S. since 2005.\par \par \uc2 "Every company in Florida has reinsurance," said Joseph Petrelli, president of Demotech Inc., an insurance ratings firm with a specialty in Florida's homeowners market. "They buy reinsurance for multiple storms, and it is across the entire season."\par \par \uc2 The national carriers now account for only about one-fifth of Florida's market, far less than the more than half they commanded in 1992, according to S&P. The replacements include such companies as \uc2 Universal Insurance Holdings Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 HCI Group Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The state runs a reinsurance company itself, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, that provides much of the reinsurance. The next biggest providers to insurers in the state are \uc2 Lloyd's of London\uc2 , Bermuda-based \uc2 Everest Re Group Ltd\uc2 . , Germany-based \uc2 Allianz SE\uc2  and \uc2 Tokio Marine Holdings Inc\uc2 . in Japan, according to \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Many reinsurers that sell to Florida's home insurers are in Bermuda, which has grown into a global reinsurance capital in part by specializing in the state's hurricane risk.\par \par \uc2 In at least one instance, the reinsurance comes from Omaha, Neb. HCI Group Chief Executive \uc2 Paresh Patel\uc2  says a unit of \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway Inc\uc2 . is one of its several reinsurers.\par \par \uc2 The heavy reliance on this behind-the-scenes backstop community sent reinsurance stocks tumbling over the past week as Irma's power grew, while well-known national homeowners insurers like \uc2 Allstate Corp\uc2 . were down more modestly.\par \par \uc2 Many reinsurers fell sharply last week, when fear about Irma's danger to Florida began growing. Among the big decliners: \uc2 Axis Capital Holdings Ltd\uc2 . , \uc2 Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd\uc2 . , and \uc2 Validus Holdings Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Aside from reinsurance, some insurance firms use "catastrophe bonds" to help offset their risk from a natural disaster. Because interest rates have been low since the global financial crisis of 2008, many yield-hungry pension plans, endowments and other big investors have pumped money into these securities.\par \par \uc2 The popularity of "cat bonds" has fueled competition with traditional reinsurance companies. Premium rates for catastrophe reinsurance for property have fallen about half since 2011, according to reinsurance brokers.\par \par \uc2 The "massive amount of new capital" flowing into cat bonds and the other reinsurance investments was a pivotal factor in allowing the smaller insurers to take on responsibility that the national carriers shed, said Kevin McCarty, a founder of Celtic Global Consulting LLC and former Florida insurance commissioner. As prices were driven down, these smaller firms could buy more reinsurance.\par \par \uc2 Many analysts say Harvey and Irma and other disasters this year would need to top $100 billion in insured damage before prices would harden, given how much capital there is. Risk-modeling firms estimate that insured damage from Harvey will be between $25 billion and $35 billion, while some early estimates put Irma's in the tens of billions of dollars also.\par \par \uc2 To help insure that reinsurance arrangements are adequate, Florida insurance regulators annually run a "catastrophe stress test" that simulates the impact of major hurricanes and the insurers' ability to pay claim, a spokeswoman for \uc2 Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Nicole Friedman contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Nestled in House Spending Bill: Campaign-Finance Deregulation\par \par \uc2 By Cezary Podkul\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14House Republicans are backing several provisions that could reshape campaign-finance rules ahead of next year's midterm elections as spending negotiations continue this fall.\par \par \uc2 The measures are included in a GOP package of spending bills being debated in the House. While the House package is unlikely to advance in the Senate, its provisions could become bargaining chips in the negotiations leading up to the next government-funding deadline, now Dec. 8.\par \par \uc2 Under one deregulatory measure in the spending package, churches may be able to contribute to candidates without fear of losing their tax-exempt status, furthering President Donald Trump's promise to "get rid of and totally destroy" a law that forbids such activity.\par \par \uc2 Corporations also would be able to ask their employees to donate to unlimited numbers of trade associations' political-action groups instead of limiting employee solicitations to one group per year.\par \par \uc2 Other measures included in the bill would continue to prevent the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  and the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  from implementing rules that would affect political activities of 501(C)(4) nonprofits and publicly traded corporations, respectively.\par \par \uc2 And the government would still be prohibited from requiring federal contractors to disclose their political contributions and campaign expenditures.\par \par \uc2 The multiple provisions\u8212\'20\'14called riders\u8212\'20\'14are prompting pushback from campaign-finance watchdogs, who generally favor tighter restrictions on money in politics. The provisions have been sought by religious or business groups, who have argued they are otherwise hamstrung from fully participating in the political process.\par \par \uc2 Riders are frequently inserted into appropriation bills as a way to pass controversial policies without having them voted on individually, because they would "ride along" with a larger spending bill.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear which House members inserted the language into the bill, which was drafted by the Republican majority. House Democrats tried to strike many of the provisions but didn't succeed. The House is expected to debate and possibly vote on a package of spending bills that includes the riders as early as this week.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the House passed a bill to fund the government until Dec. 8. Lawmakers hope to pass a longer-term spending bill in December.\par \par \uc2 "It's as many riders as has been done in this area. Probably the most," said Fred Wertheimer, president of the group Democracy 21 and an architect of the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance overhaul bill. His concern, he said, is that the riders would enable "secret money" to "flow into elections."\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Democracy 21 and about 20 other organizations sent a letter to House members asking them to oppose the riders.\par \par \uc2 The religious rider would allow churches to skirt the so-called Johnson Amendment. Named after its primary sponsor when he was senator, the late Lyndon Johnson, the 1954 rule prohibits 501(C)(3) nonprofit organizations\u8212\'20\'14such as churches\u8212\'20\'14from endorsing or opposing political candidates. While the IRS has rarely enforced the ban, the rider could give violators a free pass.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Family Research Council\uc2 , a conservative Christian group, is lobbying to repeal the Johnson Amendment and has worked with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) to introduce a bill that would do so, according to its website.\par \par \uc2 "A nonprofit organization should not lose its tax-exempt status or be threatened with audits because it exercises its constitutional right to speak in favor of political candidates who share the organization's values and mission," the group argues.\par \par \uc2 The group didn't return a request for comment. A spokesman for Mr. Scalise, who was shot at a congressional baseball practice in June and has been in rehabilitation ever since, said his bill would prevent "unelected IRS bureaucrats from stifling the free speech of religious leaders and others under the auspices of the Johnson Amendment."\par \par \uc2 Another provision would continue to prevent the IRS from implementing a long-stalled rule that would better define the limits on political activities of organizations exempt from income taxes under section 501(C)(4) of the tax code. By law, such organizations are supposed to be "operated exclusively" for social-welfare purposes, but the IRS has interpreted the law to allow them to spend as much as 49% of their money on political causes.\par \par \uc2 Campaign-finance watchdogs like Mr. Wertheimer have pushed the IRS for years to limit its definition of social-welfare spending to eschew political expenditures. The long-running issue gained public notice in 2013, when the IRS apologized for targeting 501(c)(4) applications by tea-party and other conservative groups for closer scrutiny. The IRS subsequently proposed a rule aimed at clarifying limits on political activity by such groups. But many GOP lawmakers\u8212\'20\'14as well as a range of advocacy groups\u8212\'20\'14raised concerns, leading to the congressionally imposed moratorium.\par \par \uc2 The rider on the rule over disclosure of political spending by corporations wouldn't allow the SEC to "study, develop, propose, finalize, issue, or implement" the rule-making during the government's next fiscal year, a stronger prohibition than under existing law.\par \par \uc2 Business groups including the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  have opposed greater disclosure of political activity. They have argued to the SEC that forcing businesses to disclose political giving would hurt companies and their stockholders by "burdening, and in some cases preventing, corporations' participation in the political process."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 ITG Executive Jamie Selway Withdraws as Candidate for Top Regulatory Role\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels and Alexander Osipovich\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The top candidate to run the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 's division overseeing stock exchanges and most trading firms has withdrawn from consideration, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Jamie Selway, a managing director at Investment Technology Group Inc., dropped out of the process last week, the people said.

"It wasn't sexual," he said.\par \par \uc2 SoFi's board said Mr. Fanlo "left the company in May 2017 to pursue another executive opportunity. He no longer has any relationship with the company."\par \par \uc2 Separately, SoFi's board disclosed after questioning from the Journal that in 2012 it paid money to settle a dispute between a lower-level employee and Chief Executive \uc2 Michael Cagney\uc2 . The nature of the dispute isn't known, but the board said it didn't involve a sexual relationship.\par \par \uc2 The allegations levied against SoFi occur against a backdrop of debate within Silicon Valley about the culture of startups. Numerous companies in recent years have been the subject of accusations of improper conduct or hostile work environments. One of the industry's leading players, \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 ., has been criticized for its treatment of women in the workplace, which was one factor in the resignation of \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2 . its high-profile chief executive and founder.\par \par \uc2 SoFi was started six years ago and has thrived as it courted money managers into funding the loans it made to graduates of top-ranked universities. The San Francisco company has raised nearly $2 billion from investors, including a $500 million funding round this year, and recently signaled it was moving closer to an initial public offering.\par \par \uc2 Employees describe a culture inside its headquarters in the Presidio neighborhood in San Francisco and a call center in nearby Healdsburg, Calif., where they felt pressure to work extra hours at night and on holidays to avoid being fired. Mr. Cagney, 46 years old, used to tell SoFi staff that if they weren't waking up twice a week in a cold sweat, they weren't working hard enough, according to a former staffer.\par \par \uc2 Some of those employees said that the culture veered out of control at times, with executives breaking furniture and throwing telephones out of anger.\par \par \uc2 A SoFi spokesman said that the company had experienced strong growth and that it has been adding staff "to make sure we deliver the experience SoFi members and applicants expect while creating the internal culture we want."\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 11, a former operations manager, Brandon Charles, sued the company in a wrongful-termination claim, adding that a fellow manager had harassed female employees by making sexual or inappropriate comments. SoFi has said it investigated Mr. Charles's claims and found them to be meritless.\par \par \uc2 Less than 24 hours after Mr. Charles amended his lawsuit on Aug. 31, a companywide note sent by Mr. Cagney said that SoFi had launched an investigation into sexual-harassment claims.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Charles's lawsuit claimed that Mr. Cagney fostered a culture of "male bravado" in which sexual harassment was permitted.\par \par \uc2 A separate suit was filed last month by a group of former employees that accused the firm of pushing staff to work long hours without proper compensation. SoFi said it takes any allegations of unfair treatment seriously and it is reserving further comment until it responds to the complaint in court.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cagney wrote to employees in his note that outside attorneys would look into other sexual-harassment claims. The investigation Cagney alluded to isn't into claims made in Mr. Charles's lawsuit or the other lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 He said in the companywide note that as SoFi was preparing its response to Mr. Charles's lawsuit, it discovered several people were prepared to "formally allege" they were witnesses to or victims of "improper activity" at the company's operations center in Healdsburg.\par \par \uc2 Although the company is growing quickly, "Our rapid expansion is no excuse for bad behavior in the workplace," Mr. Cagney wrote.\par \par \uc2 In the past year, SoFi's staff has doubled to more than 1,200 people, a company representative said.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, a dispute between Mr. Cagney and an employee led to an investigation by the company's board, which hadn't been previously reported.\par \par \uc2 Last week, SoFi's board issued a statement to the Journal saying, "The board concluded that it was in the best interests of all parties to reach a settlement. ... There was no allegation or evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship between Mr. Cagney and the employee."\par \par \uc2 The employee is no longer with the company and declined to comment. Mr. Cagney said he never had any relationship with a current or former SoFi employee, except for his wife, who works at SoFi.\par \par \uc2 Neither Mr. Cagney nor the company would discuss the nature of the dispute that led to the settlement, citing confidentiality agreements.\par \par \uc2 More than half a dozen former employees told the Journal that there were workplace issues involving Mr. Fanlo. He would commonly make comments about the physical appearance of female employees and touch their shoulders in ways that made them uneasy, according to ex-workers who experienced both behaviors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Charles's lawsuit said Mr. Fanlo "touched women inappropriately, and made them feel uncomfortable."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Fanlo said that no one raised complaints with him and that he would have stopped had he known it made employees uncomfortable.\par \par \uc2 "I would have said, \u8216\'20\'18Geez, I'm sorry,'" had those gestures been interpreted in that way.\par \par \uc2 Another former employee described a loan-review meeting that Mr. Fanlo attended along with the former employee, alleging that he made comments about a female applicant's breasts in front of other staff members. Mr. Fanlo said he didn't recall any such meeting.\par \par \uc2 SoFi has produced solid financial results. In the second quarter, SoFi reported record revenue of over $143 million and adjusted profit of $61.6 million, according to a letter to investors that was reviewed by the Journal.\par \par \uc2 SoFi is also experiencing some growing pains as it moves to expand its business into mortgages, life insurance, wealth management, and digital-banking applications. Among its other expansion plans, SoFi plans to take its business to foreign countries and roll out a family of funds it would manage for investors.\par \par \uc2 The company is also trying to open a bank in Utah. That move has drawn opposition from consumer-advocacy groups that question its commitment to lower-income borrowers, as well as questions from a powerful member of Congress.\par \par \uc2 SoFi's plans to branch out beyond its original student-loan refinancing business have hit snags. Efforts to move into the U.K. and Australia have been delayed.\par \par \uc2 The company has fallen short of its goal to have $287 million in assets under management by 2016 in its fledgling wealth-advisory business, according to presentations and filings reviewed by the Journal. As of September, the latest figure was $12 million.\par \par \uc2 The company is also trying to build an asset-management business, a project that gained steam after SoFi acquired Mr. Cagney's hedge-fund firm, Cabezon Investment Group LLC, last year in a deal valued at $3.25 million. Former Cabezon employees are working on plans to offer funds that would hold the riskier parts of bonds backed by SoFi's consumer loans, according to the filings and documents.\par \par \uc2 Some SoFi shareholders had worried that Cabezon had become a distraction to Mr. Cagney. In early 2015, when SoFi was previously considering whether it should file for a public offering, Cabezon suffered a deep loss after it bet wrong on a move in the Swiss franc.\par \par \uc2 A SoFi spokesman said Mr. Cagney "recused himself from all board discussions and decisions related to the acquisition" of Cabezon, which has $200 million in assets and generates annual fees including $1 million in management fees and "performance fees that have historically been many multiples of that."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Telis Demos contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Philadelphia Fed Launches Initiative to Study Consumer Finance\par \par \uc2 By Yuka Hayashi\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\uc2  launched Friday an initiative to study consumer behavior and its effect on the economy and financial system.\par \par \uc2 The new Consumer Finance Institute will bring together scholars, financial companies, consumer groups and regulators to share insights on consumer finance and help inform policy decisions that affect the U.S. economy, the \uc2 Philadelphia Fed\uc2  said in a press release.\par \par \uc2 The regional Fed bank said the institute will build on consumer-related research it has done in the past in areas such as credit cards, student loans, homeownership and payment systems.\par \par \uc2 "The absence of a fully developed field of robust research on consumer credit fundamentally indicates that we didn't acknowledge that it touches every aspect of the economy," Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said in a speech delivered at the bank's conference on consumer behavior in credit and payments markets. "Consumer issues are intertwined and interwoven, inextricable from virtually every economic issue."\par \par \uc2 The new institute also will enable the \uc2 Philadelphia Fed\uc2  to expand its research on consumer payment markets.\par \par \uc2 Analyze This: New Bank Research Rules Spark Price War in Europe\par \par \uc2 By Max Colchester and Christopher Whittall\par \par \uc2 How much are investment research reports actually worth?\par \par \uc2 The answer: less than the banks that produce them think.\par \par \uc2 In Europe a tug of war is playing out between banks and asset managers over the value of research that floods investors' inboxes every day urging them to buy or sell securities.\par \par \uc2 Currently banks dole out reports to asset managers for free, hoping to recoup the cost through commissions on trading. But as of Jan. 3 this opaque pricing system will be altered in Europe. New rules mean asset managers will have to disclose how much they spend on research every year.\par \par \uc2 That means putting a price on research. And banks and asset managers aren't seeing eye-to-eye.\par \par \uc2 As the haggling gets under way a price-war has broken out. Earlier this year, banks were quoting Olivier de Larouzi\u232\'00\'E8re, head of interest rates at Natixis Asset Management, an annual fee of as much as \u8364\'20\'AC300,000 for his firm to have unfettered access to fixed-income research and meetings with analysts. Since then, most banks' prices have plummeted, he said, to around \u8364\'20\'AC70,000 on average, though some are still trying to charge about \u8364\'20\'AC150,000.\par \par \uc2 "The gap has clearly narrowed a lot," said Mr. de Larouzi\u232\'00\'E8re. But he still gets "very, very different proposals," he added.\par \par \uc2 Overall total spending on research and trading execution could fall by up to $3 billion, according to consultancy \uc2 Oliver Wyman\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Banks are increasingly at odds over the scope of research coverage to offer clients\u8212\'20\'14and how much to charge for it. Some are still hoping to negotiate big fees into the millions of dollars a year with the biggest asset managers. Others are looking to give away some of their research reports for free.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG\uc2  is exploiting a loophole in the new regulations to offer some basic bond research free of charge online, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Swiss bank hopes to make money by charging for access to analysts instead, this person said. Dutch bank \uc2 ING Groep\uc2  said Tuesday it will be giving away some of its economics analysis for nothing, as a way to promote its brand.\par \par \uc2 For equity research banks are hoping to charge a little more. \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . is toward the bottom of the pack, quoting basic access to read-only equity reports for $10,000 a year, according to a person familiar with the matter, with prices steadily increasing for clients who want more face-time with top analysts.\par \par \uc2 At the other end of the scale, \uc2 Barclays PLC\uc2  is trying to price its research as a premium product, according to several clients.\par \par \uc2 Asset managers are working out how much of this research they actually want.\par \par \uc2 "It's made us have quality control. How much do I really need?" said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for fixed income at AXA Investment Managers.\par \par \uc2 Several investment firms asked their fund managers to rank research based on what was essential, helpful or useless. The results showed a lot of research is never read.\par \par \uc2 The new rules are "very bad for the price of bad research," said Neil Scarth, principal at Frost Consulting & Advisory. But they could also make the cost of access to top quality analysis increase, he adds.\par \par \uc2 Under the current system, equity investors pay a commission fee to a broker when they trade. Part of that fee goes toward executing the trade and a portion is retained to pay for additional services, including equity research.\par \par \uc2 So there is some idea of how much equity research should cost. The U.K.'s \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  estimates U.K. investment managers pay around \u163\'00\'A33 billion of dealing commissions a year to brokers, of which half is spent on research.\par \par \uc2 In fixed-income investing, however, the two sides are heading into uncharted waters. Banks currently provide fixed-income research to clients for free in the hope they'd direct business their way in the form of trading bonds or currencies.\par \par \uc2 The new rules are part of a revision of an EU law that is implemented by regulators across the trading bloc. One of its aims is to stop asset managers receiving "inducements" to trade with certain brokers and guarantee value for investors.\par \par \uc2 Fixed income managers aren't delighted at the prospect of transparency. Many see paying for research as an extra cost that must either be passed onto their clients or taken from their own profits.\par \par \uc2 "Spreads will not come down because of this," said Craig MacDonald, global head of fixed income at \uc2 Standard Life Aberdeen\uc2  , adding that it costs a similar amount to trade with some brokers who don't provide research as those that do.\par \par \uc2 To push down research prices, fund managers are telling the banks: You need us more than we need you. Meeting bank analysts may be helpful to gauge the mood in the broader investment community, but the exchange of information cuts both ways.\par \par \uc2 They also exploited banks' overriding concern that if money managers didn't buy their research, they would trade with them less. "If you have no relationship in terms of research, how strong will your relationship stay in terms of execution?" said Mr. de Larouzi\u232\'00\'E8re.\par \par \uc2 Mr. de Larouzi\u232\'00\'E8re said his business uses around 50 research providers now, but he intends to cut that by more than half. He said he was now getting research quotes "at very low prices because they need to be on that list."\par \par \uc2 The adoption of the new European rules is complicated by the fact that in the U.S. the rules are in conflict. EU asset managers will have an obligation to pay for research. However U.S. firms, that aren't registered investment advisers, are prohibited from receiving direct payments. But analysts expect this to change.\par \par \uc2 "Research is a product that is going to be sold everywhere," said Elliot Hand, a manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. "This will become standard."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Equifax Breach Raises Fraud Risks\par \par \uc2 Equifax' data breach raises risks of increased fraud. More attempts at tax fraud may occur in the upcoming tax season, says Matthew Morris, partner at law firm Bowditch & Dewey. Morris, who specializes in part in individual tax, He says middle and low-income wage earners are more likely to be victims because more income tax is withheld from their paychecks throughout the year than is typically owed after deductions and credits have been claimed. Another risk: medical fraud, says Liz Weston, financial planner at NerdWallet. Personal identifying information could be used to impersonate victims to get medical care, falsify claims or fraudulently get government benefits, she says.

Rather than be paid for an endorsement for a dotcom start-up, she took a 10 per cent stake in the business. It seemed wise. At the time, everyone was investing in internet businesses and a rush of initial public offerings was making early investors into millionaires.\par \par \uc2 I was reminded of this amid a flurry of news about the new boom in cryptocurrencies - and their celebrity backers.\par \par \uc2 Ms Goldberg's venture, Flooz, was billed as the future of money in a digital world and it hoped one day to rival the dollar. The way it worked, however, was much less revolutionary. The service resembled a gift certificate: customers paid in dollars and received Flooz balances. These could be redeemed at participating merchants, with the hope that credits would one day circulate as money in their own right.\par \par \uc2 The problem for Flooz was that little prevented mass replication of its model. One prominent competitor, Beenz, differed only slightly, by allowing its units to trade at fluctuating market prices.\par \par \uc2 Like banking syndicates before them, the ventures decided to club together for mutual benefit by accepting each other's currencies in their networks.\par \par \uc2 Even so, by 2001 both companies had failed, brought down by a lack of the one ingredient that counts most in finance: trust. Flooz was knocked by security concerns after it transpired that a Russian crime syndicate had taken advantage of its currency, while the fluctuating value of Beenz soon put users off.\par \par \uc2 Their loss turned into \uc2 PayPal\uc2 's gain, the latter succeeding precisely because it had set its aspirations much lower. Rather than replace established currencies, \uc2 PayPal\uc2  focused on improving the dollar's online mobility, notably by creating a secure network that gained public support. This, it turned out, is what people really wanted.\par \par \uc2 Did we learn anything from the failures of the internet boom? Apparently not. In what is looking increasingly like a new incarnation of dotcom fever, celebrities are endorsing virtual currency systems. Heiress and reality TV star Paris Hilton tweeted this week that she would be backing fundraising for LydianCoin , a digital token still at concept stage. It offers redemption against online \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -assisted advertising campaigns. Baroness Michelle Mone, a businesswoman, announced she would be accepting bitcoin in exchange for luxury Dubai flats.\par \par \uc2 What is particularly striking about this path to riches is its "growing money on trees" character.\par \par \uc2 While the internet boom was dominated by IPOs, linked to a potentially profitable venture to come, this time it is " initial coin offerings " igniting investor fervour. Most ICOs do not aspire to deliver profits or returns. Indeed, from a regulatory standpoint, they cannot - most lawyers agree doing so could classify them as securities, drawing regulatory intervention which would force them into stringent listing processes.\par \par \uc2 That opinion was substantiated in July when the \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  warned : "Virtual coins or tokens may be securities and subject to the federal securities laws" and that "it is relatively easy for anyone to use blockchain technology to create an \uc2 ICO\uc2  that looks impressive, even though it might actually be a scam."\par \par \uc2 So most ICOs make do by selling tokens for pre-existing virtual currencies for promises of direct redemption against online goods, services or concepts, or simply in the hope the tokens themselves will rocket in value despite offering nothing specific in return.\par \par \uc2 They still think they can succeed where other parallel currency systems have failed, by bolting into preestablished blockchain-distributed currency systems such as \uc2 Ethereum\uc2  or bitcoin. These already come with a network of token-owning users. But with the numbers of conventional merchants that will accept these currencies falling rather than rising, these holders need something more compelling to spend their digital wealth on.\par \par \uc2 As it stands, the real economy can only be accessed by cashing out digital currency for conventional money at cryptocurrency exchanges. This comes at some expense. But with regulators clamping down on how exchanges are governed, token holders who cannot or do not want to pass through know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures remain frozen out.\par \par \uc2 That leaves their holdings good for only three things: virtual currency speculation, which is ultimately a zero-sum game; redemption against dark-market goods or capital control circumvention.\par \par \uc2 It is assumed ICOs offering real goods, services or real estate in exchange for cryptocurrencies can somehow tap into this sizeable, albeit potentially illicit and restricted, wealth pool. Yet if competing unregulated economies really start gaining traction, governments will act.\par \par \uc2 China's central bank\uc2  has already branded ICOs an illegal form of crowdfunding and more rulings are expected from other jurisdictions in coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 Then again, if history teaches us anything, the system's own propensity to cultivate fraud and unnecessary complexity in the face of more secure and regulated competition may be the more likely thing to bring it down. When given the choice, people usually opt for security.\par \par \uc2 izabella.kaminska@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170909ed990003c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

However, computer algorithms could drill through the myriad of factors and be trained to mathematically discern signals and patterns almost undetectable to humans, Mr Allen said.\par \par \uc2 To overcome what he says is a lack of high-quality public data, the company has privately purchased and collected 200 human tumours. Gritstone scientists have analysed each one at a molecular level to provide thousands of data points that can be fed through the sensitive computer programs.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170908ed980002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 In 1999, the actor Whoopi Goldberg made a bold decision. Rather than be paid for an endorsement for a dotcom start-up, she took a 10 per cent stake in the business. It seemed wise.\u160\'00\'A0At the time, everyone was investing in internet businesses and a rush of initial public offerings was making early investors into millionaires.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I was reminded of this amid a flurry of news about the new boom in cryptocurrencies \u8212\'20\'14 and their celebrity backers.\par \par \uc2 Ms Goldberg\u8217\'20\'19s venture, Flooz, was billed as the future of money in a digital world and it hoped one day to rival the dollar. The way it worked, however, was much less revolutionary. The service resembled a gift certificate: customers paid in dollars and received Flooz balances. These could be redeemed at participating merchants, with the hope that credits would one day circulate as money in their own right.\par \par \uc2 The problem for Flooz was that little prevented mass replication of its model. One prominent competitor, Beenz, differed only slightly, by allowing its units to trade at fluctuating market prices.\par \par \uc2 Like banking syndicates before them, the ventures decided to club together for mutual benefit by accepting each other\u8217\'20\'19s currencies in their networks.\par \par \uc2 Even so, by 2001 both companies had failed, brought down by a lack of the one ingredient that counts most in finance: trust. Flooz was knocked by security concerns after it transpired that a Russian crime syndicate had taken advantage of its currency, while the fluctuating value of Beenz soon put users off.\par \par \uc2 Their loss turned into \uc2 PayPal\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s gain, the latter succeeding precisely because it had set its aspirations much lower. Rather than replace established currencies, \uc2 PayPal\uc2  focused on improving the dollar\u8217\'20\'19s online mobility, notably by creating a secure network that gained public support. This, it turned out, is what people really wanted.\par \par \uc2 Did we learn anything from the failures of the internet boom? Apparently not. In what is looking increasingly like a new incarnation of dotcom fever, celebrities are endorsing virtual currency systems. Heiress and reality TV star Paris Hilton tweeted this week that she would be backing fundraising for LydianCoin, a digital token still at concept stage. It offers redemption against online \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -assisted advertising campaigns. Baroness Michelle Mone, a businesswoman, announced she would be accepting bitcoin in exchange for luxury Dubai flats.\par \par \uc2 What is particularly striking about this path to riches is its \u8220\'20\'1Cgrowing money on trees\u8221\'20\'1D character.\par \par \uc2 While the internet boom was dominated by IPOs, linked to a potentially profitable venture to come, this time it is \u8220\'20\'1Cinitial coin offerings\u8221\'20\'1D igniting investor fervour. Most ICOs do not aspire to deliver profits or returns. Indeed, from a regulatory standpoint, they cannot \u8212\'20\'14 most lawyers agree doing so could classify them as securities, drawing regulatory intervention which would force them into stringent listing processes.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 That opinion was substantiated in July when the \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0warned: \u8220\'20\'1CVirtual coins or tokens may be securities and subject to the federal securities laws\u8221\'20\'1D and that\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Cit is relatively easy for anyone to use blockchain technology to create an \uc2 ICO\uc2  that looks impressive, even though it might actually be a scam.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 So most ICOs make do by selling tokens for pre-existing virtual currencies for promises of direct redemption against online goods, services or concepts, or simply in the hope the tokens themselves will rocket in value despite offering nothing specific in return.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 They still think they can succeed where other parallel currency systems have failed, by bolting into pre-\par \par \uc2 established blockchain-distributed currency systems such as \uc2 Ethereum\uc2  or bitcoin. These already come with a network of token-owning users. But with the numbers of conventional merchants that will accept these currencies falling rather than rising, these holders need something more compelling to spend their digital wealth on.\par \par \uc2 As it stands, the real economy can only be accessed by cashing out digital currency for conventional money at cryptocurrency exchanges. This comes at some expense. But with regulators clamping down on how exchanges are governed, token holders who cannot or do not want to pass through know-your-customer and anti-money laundering procedures remain frozen out.\par \par \uc2 That leaves their holdings good for only three things: virtual currency speculation, which is ultimately a zero-sum game; redemption against dark-market goods or capital control circumvention.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 It is assumed ICOs offering real goods, services or real estate in exchange for cryptocurrencies can somehow tap into this sizeable, albeit potentially illicit and restricted, wealth pool. Yet if competing unregulated economies really start gaining traction, governments will act.\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s central bank\uc2  has already branded\u160\'00\'A0ICOs an illegal form of crowdfunding and more rulings are expected from other jurisdictions in coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 Then again, if history teaches us anything, the system\u8217\'20\'19s own propensity to cultivate fraud and unnecessary complexity in the face of more secure and regulated competition may be the more likely thing to bring it down. When given the choice, people usually opt for security.\par \par \uc2 izabella.kaminska@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020170908ed9800a3x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Davies \par \uc2 466 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 September 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 [Financial Analysis and Commentary]\par \par \uc2 Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest Atlantic storms in years, already has pounded several Caribbean islands and threatens lives and catastrophic damage in the Dominican Republic, Haiti and beyond.\par \par \uc2 For the insurance industry, it is what happens from Saturday onward that matters most. This Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of up to 185 miles an hour is heading on a track likely to take it up the east coast of Florida. If this path and the storm's strength are sustained, Irma could be the costliest hurricane for insurers ever, according to \uc2 Barclays\uc2  analysts, outdoing even the damage done by Katrina in 2005.\par \par \uc2 There is still uncertainty around this, and many hurricanes dissipate or change direction, but investors are already reacting. Shares of U.S.-listed insurers and reinsurers with big natural catastrophe exposures, such as \uc2 Aspen Insurance\uc2 , Validus, RenaissanceRe and Everest Re, have already dropped by 7% to 10% since Friday.\par \par \uc2 The industry is already expecting significant losses -- upward of $10 billion -- from Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas last month. But this will only lead to a drop in profits rather than stop the squeeze on reinsurance pricing. Such a loss isn't big enough to dent the huge amount of capital that has flooded into reinsurance risk in the past decade. Since 2008, capital in the reinsurance sector has almost doubled to $605 billion at the end of March of this year from $340 billion, according to \uc2 Aon\uc2  Benfield \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A lot of this capital growth has been in traditional reinsurance, but alternative capital -- in the form of catastrophe bonds and related products -- has more than quadrupled over the same period to $86 billion, or 14% of the industry total, its highest share ever.\par \par \uc2 Money has continued to flow despite declining yields on cat bonds and falling returns on equity for reinsurers, because the income investors get from both is still attractive compared with other investments, while catastrophe risk is also seen as independent of the economic cycle that affects other investments.\par \par \uc2 Global catastrophe losses for the reinsurance industry exceeded $55 billion last year, the fourth-highest loss in the past decade, and yet reinsurance prices have still fallen. Some think it will take a single loss of more than $100 billion to turn the tide of more capital and weaker returns in reinsurance. Even a direct hit by a powerful Irma on Florida's population centers might not be big enough to buck the trend.\par \par \uc2 Investors have been taking on more risk for less return in the insurance industry for some time. So far, the trade-off hasn't been too painful, but at some point that will change.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich333\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal4995

Davies \par \uc2 534 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 September 2017\par 09:32\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest Atlantic storms in years, has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-irma-makes-landfall-in-caribbean-1504703678"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 already pounded}}}\uc2  several Caribbean islands and threatens lives and catastrophic damage in the Dominican Republic, Haiti {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tracking-hurricane-irmas-path-1504726383?mg=prod/accounts-wsj"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 and beyond}}}\uc2  in the next 24 hours.\par \par \uc2 For the insurance industry, however, it is what happens from Saturday onward that matters most. This Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds at up to 185 miles an hour is heading on a track likely to take it up the east coast of Florida. If this path and the storm's strength are sustained, Irma could be the costliest hurricane for insurers ever, according to analysts at \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , outdoing even the damage done by Katrina in 2005.\par \par \uc2 There is still uncertainty around this and many hurricanes dissipate, or change direction, but investors are already reacting. Shares in U.S. listed insurers and reinsurers with big natural catastrophe exposures, such as \uc2 Aspen Insurance\uc2 , Validus, RenaissanceRe and Everest Re, have already dropped by 7% to 10% since Friday.\par \par \uc2 The industry is already expecting significant losses\u8212\'20\'14upward of $10 billion\u8212\'20\'14from Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas last month. But this will only lead to a drop in profits rather than stop the squeeze on reinsurance pricing\u8212\'20\'14such a loss isn't big enough to dent the huge amount of capital that has flooded into reinsurance risk in past decade. Since 2008, capital in the reinsurance sector has almost doubled to $605 billion at the end of March this year from $340 billion, according to \uc2 Aon\uc2  Benfield \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A lot of this capital growth has been in traditional reinsurance, but alternative capital\u8212\'20\'14in the form of catastrophe bonds and related products\u8212\'20\'14has more than quadrupled over the same period to $86 billion, or 14% of the industry total, its highest share ever.\par \par \uc2 Money has continued to flow despite declining yields on cat bonds and falling returns on equity for reinsurers, because the income investors get from both is still attractive compared with other investments, while catastrophe risk is also seen as independent of the economic cycle that affect other investments. Cat bonds for example still pay annual yields of more than 5% on average, according to \uc2 Moody's\uc2 . But the industry dynamics are so poor that \uc2 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-should-listen-to-buffetts-reinsurance-guru-1441964395"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 stopped writing catastrophe reinsurance}}}\uc2  in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Global catastrophe losses for the reinsurance industry exceeded $55 billion last year, the fourth highest loss in the past decade, and yet reinsurance prices have still fallen. Some think it will take a single loss of more than $100 billion to turn the tide of more capital and weaker returns in reinsurance. Even a direct hit by a powerful Irma on Florida's population centers might not be big enough to buck the trend.\par \par \uc2 Investors have been taking on more risk for less return in the insurance industry for some time. So far the trade-off hasn't been too painful, but at some point that will change.\par \par \uc2 Write to Paul J.

And that is before any impact from Hurricane Irma, which could devastate cities across the Southeast.\par \par \uc2 It will be hard to discern whether bad reports result from storm damage and then whether good reports owe to the effects of rebuilding. The Fed, already struggling with conflicting signals as it decides the path of rate rises, must look through even greater volatility in inflation and other reports. It could be well into 2018 before the effects of the storms have fully washed out of economic data.\par \par \uc2 Forecasters in The Wall Street Journal's survey of economists expect the storm to reduce the pace of job gains by about 27,000 jobs a month in the third quarter on average, followed by little change in the fourth quarter and then a boost of 13,000 in the first quarter 2018, as many {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/harveys-rebuilding-squad-your-employer-1504797709"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 people find work rebuilding}}}\uc2 . Fed policy makers watch job growth closely for signs of whether the labor market is tightening.\par \par \uc2 Economists also expect the growth rate of gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, will fall by about 0.3 percentage points in the third quarter, followed by no effect on the fourth quarter, and a 0.2-percentage-point boost in the first quarter of 2018.\par \par \uc2 "The devastation in the surrounding Houston area, America's fourth-largest city, will be significant enough to negatively impact activity and employment nationally," said Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.\par \par \uc2 In the longer run, the storm isn't expected to have a lasting economic effect, with forecasts for GDP, unemployment, inflation and other major economic indicators unchanged for 2018 overall, according to the survey of 56 business, financial and academic economists from Sept. 1 to Sept. 5. In the months ahead, here is where economists say to watch for the storm's distortions.\par \par \uc2 Jobless Claims\par \par \uc2 Early evidence of the hurricane's impact on the U.S. job market came Thursday, when the Labor Department reported the largest one-week jump in initial jobless claims since the aftermath of superstorm Sandy in November 2012. It is likely only the beginning of a spike in unemployment filings.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012, jobless claims were highest not during the week of the storm, but two weeks after. Many who were out of work from the hurricane waited until the storm had passed to file their claims.\par \par \uc2 Compared with the week of the storm, initial jobless claims rose 23% in the second week after superstorm Sandy and 30% in the second week after Hurricane Katrina.\par \par \uc2 "Irma's right behind Harvey, so that could cause claims to spike again," said Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Inflation\par \par \uc2 Measures of inflation will soon reflect Harvey, with gasoline prices spiking due to disruptions to oil refineries in the Houston area. The national average gas price was $2.66 a gallon on Wednesday, according to the AAA, up from $2.35 a month ago.\par \par \uc2 Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst of \uc2 Oil Price Information Service\uc2 , sees gas prices peaking near $2.75 before leveling off.\par \par \uc2 Energy prices make up 7% of the consumer-price index, with motor fuel accounting for nearly half of that. Already, the move in gas prices could raise the inflation rate, a key area of focus for Fed policy makers, by about 0.5%. With past major storms, the effect has faded within a few months. That added volatility could further sharpen the Fed's focus on core measures of inflation that exclude food and energy.\par \par \uc2 Consumer spending\par \par \uc2 With gas prices up, consumers across the country will have less cash for everything else. Every penny increase in gasoline prices reduces consumer spending by $1 billion over the course of the year, according to Mr. Sweet of \uc2 Moody's\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Consumers are going to feel it in their pocket," Mr. Sweet said.\par \par \uc2 Consumer-spending measures may also show the impact of Houston being shuttered for so long. The city has nearly three million workers and produces about $500 billion a year of gross domestic product.\par \par \uc2 That is "a non-negligible economic impact, assuming 25% of Houston area output was idled for seven days," said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics.\par \par \uc2 Housing\par \par \uc2 Before the storm, Texas was on track for a 14% increase in housing starts this year, according to James Gaines, chief economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University.\par \par \uc2 In 2016, Houston alone accounted for about 4% of the nation's permitted housing. Now builders wait to assess the market as construction sites dry out\u8212\'20\'14and will {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-hurricane-related-shortage-construction-workers-1504798033"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 compete for workers to rebuild}}}\uc2  and repair the city.\par \par \uc2 Household Wealth\par \par \uc2 Destruction of homes and businesses doesn't show up in GDP figures, but it would show up in measures of household wealth. Many homeowners and businesses swamped by the storm didn't carry flood insurance, meaning that a large share of the over $100 billion in estimated damage could reduce household wealth.\par \par \uc2 "With so many homeowners uninsured, this is more akin to a wipeout of assets such as one would expect from a stock-market crash," said Constance Hunter, chief economist for KPMG, the accounting firm. "The effects are more negative and widespread."\par \par \uc2 But in a $19 trillion economy with 150 million workers, many of the effects will be hard to tell apart from the usual churning of such a large nation. Economic indicators can only measure so much of a storm's effect.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, "the impact on individual lives will dwarf the economic dollar losses," said Lynn Reaser, a former Bank of America economist who is now a professor at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego.\par \par \uc2 Laura Kusisto contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Josh Zumbrun at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Sarah Chaney at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:sarah.chaney@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sarah.chaney@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-survey-economists-expect-next-fed-rate-increase-in-december-1504792802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Economists Expect Next Fed Rate Increase in December}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-jobless-claims-jumped-as-hurricane-harvey-hit-gulf-coast-1504788016?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. Jobless Claims Jumped as Hurricane Harvey Hit Gulf Coast}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-second-quarter-productivity-rose-at-revised-1-5-rate-1504787501?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. Second-Quarter Productivity Rose at Revised 1.5% Rate}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20170907ed97001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The fund is expected to hit its $5.5 billion hard cap on money from outside investors, one of the people said. That amount doesn't include the additional money that will come from people within the firm, another person said.\par \par \uc2 If the firm meets its goal for \uc2 Insight Venture Partners\uc2  X LP, the fund would be its largest pool of capital raised to date. Insight previously wrapped up a $3.29 billion flagship fund\u8212\'20\'14as well as a $1.46 billion co-investment vehicle\u8212\'20\'14in 2015.\par \par \uc2 It isn't clear whether the target and hard cap amounts for the new fund include capital the firm could raise for co-investments.\par \par \uc2 Insight disclosed in a July filing with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insight-venture-partners-collects-3-6-billion-so-far-for-fund-x-1500330488"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 it had collected at least $3.61 billion for its latest flagship pool}}}\uc2 . It anticipates another closing this month, the people said.\par \par \uc2 The firm's ambition for Fund X is another sign of how investor eagerness to tap into Silicon Valley and other software hubs is leaving technology-focused private-equity firms, from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-equity-goes-big-with-11-billion-tech-focused-buyout-fund-1494244800"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Vista Equity Partners}}}\uc2  to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thoma-bravo-raises-7-6-billion-for-latest-flagship-fund-1473704895"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Thoma Bravo}}}\uc2 , flush with cash.\par \par \uc2 Insight, which has backed tech darlings such as Chinese e-commerce company \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 ., makes venture and buyout investments. The companies it has invested in typically have developed software and other tools to help a range of organizations, from churches to schools to enterprises, digitize their operations.\par \par \uc2 The New York firm is selling \uc2 eVestment Alliance LLC\uc2 , a data provider that \uc2 Nasdaq Inc\uc2 . on Tuesday said it {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaq-to-buy-evestment-for-705-million-1504631789"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 would acquire}}}\uc2  for $705 million.\par \par \uc2 The deal is one in a string of recent exits for Insight. In June, the firm {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insight-venture-partners-selling-kinnser-to-tpg-backed-mediware-1496178557"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sold}}}\uc2  home health-software provider \uc2 Kinnser Software Inc\uc2 . to \uc2 Mediware Information Systems Inc\uc2 ., a \uc2 TPG Capital\uc2 -backed peer. Also this year, Insight {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/smartbear-receives-investment-from-francisco-partners-1493809200"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sold its stake}}}\uc2  in \uc2 SmartBear Software\uc2 . San Francisco firm \uc2 Francisco Partners\uc2  acquired a majority stake in the software testing company through the deal.\par \par \uc2 Insight recently invested in Ministry Brands LLC, a software-as-a-service provider for faith-based organizations. When the deal was announced last year, a person familiar with the situation said the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insight-venture-partners-to-back-software-provider-ministry-brands-1477917002"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 transaction was valued}}}\uc2  at more than $1 billion.\par \par \uc2 Write to Dawn Lim at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:dawn.lim@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dawn.lim@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20170907ed9700105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Previous investors include \uc2 FirstMark Capital\uc2  and Slack Technologies.\par \par \uc2 Guru's software works as a coaching tool for sales and support teams. The platform uses bots and browser extensions to offer a layer of contextual knowledge within multiple applications like \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 , Gmail, Slack and \uc2 Zendesk\uc2 , giving employees cues and information to respond to customer inquiries more efficiently.\par \par \uc2 The Philadelphia company targets its services to large customer-facing organizations with similarly big sales teams that typically are distributed across geographic locations. Many have large call centers, and may have previously used third-party wikis or internal portals to manage customer \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The funding follows a period of considerable growth for Guru, said co-founder and Chief Executive \uc2 Rick Nucci\uc2 . Over the past two years, the company has added more than 300 new customers.\par \par \uc2 "Now, our focus is on building out our engineering team and investing in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  capabilities," said Mr. Nucci, who was the co-founder of Boomi (acquired by Dell in 2010). "We are introducing features that act very similar to how Amazon might recommend something to a user."\par \par \uc2 It's a tool that reduces the time it takes for employees to respond to customer queries and cracking down on redundant questions. The firm noticed the traction Guru had with customers like Square Inc., \uc2 Shopify Inc\uc2 ., and \uc2 TaskRabbit Inc\uc2 , according to Emergence Capital Principal \uc2 Jake Saper\uc2 , as well as their growth since launching in 2013.\par \par \uc2 "These are customers who are all pretty savvy and are really leaning into the technology, and no one wants to go to third party wikis anymore," said Mr. Saper, referring to common methods used in customer service \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "It's turning something static into a dynamic piece of software that essentially sits beside you and coaches you as you do your job, and that really fits into our vision of what next-generation cloud software will do for the industry."\par \par \uc2 Emergence Capital\uc2  will work with Guru as it expands its West Coast presence with the opening of a San Francisco office this year, and General Partner \uc2 Gordon Ritter\uc2  will take a board position at the company.\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Mack at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Heather.Mack@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heather.Mack@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170907ed970005n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

A deal\u160\'00\'A0could be finalised and announced in the next few weeks. One caveat: Nets is a public company so exclusivity doesn't mean this is a done deal.\u160\'00\'A0Now back to our regular\u160\'00\'A0scheduled programming.\par \par \uc2 Amazon\uc2 's\u160\'00\'A0$13.7bn purchase of\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Whole Foods\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0spooked retailers when it was announced. But news of how the deal came to be has given those retailers new hope . . . that they might be next.\par \par \uc2 This was not the story of a predatory disrupter, but rather one of courtship \u8212\'20\'14 a process Whole Foods' chief\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 John Mackey\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0breathlessly described as a "whirlwind romance". And it began with the high-end grocer, under pressure from activists, reaching out to \uc2 Amazon\uc2  after spotting a report that the ecommerce giant might be interested in buying it.\par \par \uc2 You can read more about why that news has other retailers' hearts all aflutter in\u160\'00\'A0our story here.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A couple of links for further reading:\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Here's the FT's Alphaville on whether\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/09/05/2193164/is-amazonification-real/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the Amazonification of the economy }}}\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 that is, that ecommerce, robotics and AI are crushing consumer retail prices and leading to an overall disinflationary environment \u8212\'20\'14 is real.\par \par \uc2 *\par \par \uc2 Here's an excellent piece in the Yale Law Journal on\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Amazon's antitrust paradox }}}\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0and the ways in which US law is inadequately equipped to address its anti-competitive aspects (say, how it acts as both a competitor to traditional retail and an essential piece of infrastructure for those competitors).\par \par \uc2 Before \uc2 Whole Foods\uc2 , \uc2 Amazon\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s bets were smaller. The Seattle-based ecommerce company\u160\'00\'A0has made about 130 acquisitions or investments since its debut in 1995, in a wide range of industries from books and music to cloud computing. Its largest acquisition until this year was video game site\u160\'00\'A0Twitch,\u160\'00\'A0for $970m in 2014.\par \par \uc2 So where might\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Jeff Bezos\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0next bestow his largesse? If it's going whole-hog into food, the US delivery start-up\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 GrubHub\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0might make sense, analysts say. It'd be Bezos's for a cool $4.5bn. Other options include big box retailers including\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Bed Bath & Beyond\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0and\u160\'00\'A0Target, or higher-end or speciality retailers such as\u160\'00\'A0Nordstrom,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Warby Parker\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0or\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Lowe's\uc2 .\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Amazon\uc2  has been tipped as the white knight for struggling retailers in the past, and one senior executive at a large US grocer sounds a word of caution to those holding out hope for an Amazonian life preserver: "Jeff thinks differently than us . . .

A pension fund, for example, may use the service for performance and other details in selecting hedge fund investments. \uc2 eVestment\uc2  includes as many as 2,800 individual data points on more than 74,000 investment vehicles, which it sells to investment managers, consulting firms and pension funds.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of new strategies becoming available and a lot more need for data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to make investment decisions," Ms Friedman said.\par \par \uc2 Citing research from Boston Consulting, the total size of investable assets is set to increase from $71tn in 2015 to $100tn by 2020, she said.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  will integrate \uc2 eVestment\uc2  with its existing mutual fund quotation business, which collects information from mutual funds, and plans to help \uc2 eVestment\uc2  expand. The logic of the transaction also comes in that \uc2 eVestment\uc2  operates by subscription, making it a source of recurring revenue for the group.\par \par \uc2 "We've grown this business at a 13 per cent annual growth rate since 2013, and together, we expect to produce new and expanded opportunities for our clients by combining our proprietary capabilities with \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's core information services offerings," said \uc2 Jim Minnick\uc2  , eVestment's co-founder and chief.\par \par \uc2 In the second quarter, market services, which include \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's trading businesses, accounted for 37 per cent of its $602m net revenue. The remainder was 27 per cent from corporate services, information services at 24 per cent, where \uc2 eVestment\uc2  will be housed, and market technology at 12 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170906ed9600029\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

That's a big change from the previous model, in which clients paid for research indirectly through the execution of trades or through the "spread," the difference between financial products' buying and selling prices.\par \par \uc2 The rules will apply to all banks doing business in the EU, including U.S. banks operating in the bloc.\par \par \uc2 Before the rules were approved by the EU's executive arm in 2016, banks protested the portion of legislation that would define research as an "inducement," saying such a move wasn't what lawmakers intended and it could block smaller clients' access to top-quality research.\par \par \uc2 But Markus Ferber\u8212\'20\'14the German lawmaker in charge of Mifid II, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14said this is exactly what he and his colleagues had in mind.\par \par \uc2 He told The Wall Street Journal that the entire idea was to unbundle research costs, making them transparent and no longer paid for as part of the brokerage commission. "Once prices become transparent, fund managers have to make a conscious decision about what to buy and what not to buy," Mr. Ferber said. "That will ultimately drive down prices."\par \par \uc2 Banks are now scrambling to find a price point as they negotiate with clients. \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2  halved the \u8203\'20\'0Bproposed\u8203\'20\'0B\u8203\'20\'0B \u8203\'20\'0Bprice of its fixed-income and macro research to \u8364\'20\'AC30,000 ($36,000) a year for as many as 10 users\u8203\'20\'0B, from an initially planned \u8364\'20\'AC60,000, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-23/deutsche-bank-is-said-to-halve-mifid-fixed-income-research-price"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bloomberg reported last month}}}\uc2 , citing people with knowledge of the bank's plans.\par \par \uc2 A couple of years ago, the rule against inducements caught investment banks off guard. The way the draft laws were written, it wasn't clear if "morning macro" notes summarizing market moves\u8212\'20\'14bread and butter for salespeople\u8212\'20\'14would fly under the new standards.\par \par \uc2 In what was seen as a concession, the EU's executive arm, the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , clarified that bespoke research containing so-called original insights had to be paid for directly, but banks could continue to offer market commentary as a complimentary service.\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0BUp until now, this is how it worked: A salesperson on a bank's rates or currency team would bring along a top research analyst from the same bank to meet a hedge-fund manager. With a fund investing in, say, French bonds, the salesperson would book lunch with the head of French rates research\u8203\'20\'0B\u8212\'20\'14perhaps in Mayfair,\u8203\'20\'0B the upscale London neighborhood hedge funds call home.\par \par \uc2 After wining, dining and chatting about the future of the French economy, the hedge-fund manager knew he had to pay for that research expertise. But the price wasn't clear. There was no fee. Subsequently, the hedge-fund manager would execute a few trades and throw some business over to the bank.\par \par \uc2 As of next year, investment banks will have to rely on a standalone business model to support fixed-income research that clearly stipulates pricing. Interested parties on both sides will be watching to see how it all shakes out.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 SEC Chief Wants Investors to Better Understand Cyberrisk\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK\u8212\'20\'14The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that regulators and Wall Street need to do more to educate investors about the serious risks that companies and the financial system face from cyberintrusions.\par \par \uc2 Jay Clayton, speaking at an event sponsored by \uc2 New York University\uc2 's School of Law, said investors still don't fully appreciate the threat posed by hackers. "I am not comfortable that the American investing public understands the substantial risk that we face systemically from cyber issues and I would like to see better disclosure around that," Mr. Clayton said.\par \par \uc2 Some cybersecurity experts have in the past called for the SEC to require more specific disclosures by U.S. public companies about cyberrisks, particularly following a 2013 breach at \uc2 Target Corp\uc2 . that compromised the credit- and debit-card information of millions of customers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton said the SEC would investigate companies that mislead investors about material cyberrisks, but said the battle against hackers is much broader and shouldn't be waged in government "silos."\par \par \uc2 "We have to have our individual responsibilities, but we also have to do our best to foster a collective approach to the issue," Mr. Clayton said.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's role in policing cybersecurity is more nuanced than that of many state regulators, which investigated Target for what they alleged was its failure to provide reasonable data security. Target agreed in May to pay $18.5 million to resolve the probe.\par \par \uc2 The SEC is more focused on whether financial companies that it directly supervises, such as brokerage firms and asset managers, are protecting themselves and their clients against hackers. The agency issued a risk alert last month that outlined policies it sees as effective for mitigating the risks and highlighted some deficiencies.\par \par \uc2 The markets regulator has occasionally taken enforcement action against financial firms whose practices left customers' data unprotected. It has also gone after individuals who hacked into brokerage accounts in order to carry out insider trading or other fraud. But it has never sued a public company over how it communicated the threat of hacking or breaches that it suffered.\par \par \uc2 Fired Wells Fargo Managers Sue Over Sales Scandal\par \par \uc2 By Emily Glazer\par \par \uc2 Two former managers have sued \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., claiming they were unfairly fired over the bank's sales-practices issues.\par \par \uc2 Reza Razzaghipour and Marla Razzaghipour claimed their dismissals were retaliation for them raising issues with senior managers about the questionable sales practices, such as falsification of bank records, according to a lawsuit filed Aug. 31 in Los Angeles Superior Court.\par \par \uc2 The former managers, who are husband and wife, were fired in March 2017 from positions overseeing regions in Southern California. Combined, the two managed about 3,500 staff, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.\par \par \uc2 A Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement Tuesday that the bank "denies the allegations of these two former regional presidents. The termination decisions were not retaliatory as alleged in the complaint. The company terminated the employment of these two individuals for legitimate and lawful reasons."\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  was ordered to pay a $185 million fine last year over its sales practices and has since faced public and political pressure as the scandal erupted. More than 5,300 employees were fired over a five-year period for the behavior. The bank said last week up to 3.5 million customer accounts may have been unauthorized.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit alleges that Mr. Razzaghipour reported one type of employee fraud in 2013 and fired a "significant number of employees involved." The lawsuit also alleges that Mrs. Razzaghipour, known to some at work as Marla Clemow, "reported the illegal and unethical sales practices at the highest levels multiple times."\par \par \uc2 Both former managers "never fired or disciplined anyone for failing to meet the bank's impossible and fraudulent sales goals," the lawsuit claimed.\par \par \uc2 But some current and former employees and managers have told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. and Mrs. Razzaghipour pushed them to engage in questionable sales tactics.\par \par \uc2 "My clients were fired in retaliation for complaining of illegal conduct at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , including the bank's improper sales practices," the managers' lawyer Emanuel Shirazi, of Los Angeles-based Shirazi Law Firm, said in a statement. "Despite knowing this, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  chose to scapegoat Mr. & Mrs. Razzaghipour."\par \par \uc2 The lawyer didn't comment specifically on the employee allegations.\par \par \uc2 The Razzaghipour's lawsuit also names several retail-banking executives, some of whom are still employed by the bank and others who were fired, as the real "bad actors."\par \par \uc2 The managers requested their payroll and personnel files from \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , which refused to produce them, according to the lawsuit. They then filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. In the lawsuit they ask for damages of at least $50 million.\par \par \uc2 Mortgage-Backed Securities Market Heats Up\par \par \uc2 By Peter Grant\par \par \uc2 Banks and other underwriters of commercial mortgage-backed securities are on track to issue more notes in September than any other month this year, according to a trade publication that tracks the business.\par \par \uc2 Close to $16 billion worth of deals are in the pipeline for September, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. So far this year, the top month was June, when $10.7 billion of new securities were issued, the newsletter said.\par \par \uc2 As of the end of July, deal volume had hit $47.4 billion, compared with $37.9 billion for the same period in 2016, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert. If current volume trends continue, new deals this year likely will exceed the $77.6 billion of 2016 but fall short of the $106.2 billion recorded in 2015, according to industry experts.\par \par \uc2 Volume dried up during the fourth quarter of last year partly because of new rules that went into effect on Christmas Eve under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.\par \par \uc2 Those so-called risk retention rules required issuers to keep at least 5% of the securities they create. Concerned about the added risks and costs resulting from those rules, a number of firms last year exited from the commercial mortgage-backed securities business. But the players that have remained have been able to start increasing volume.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of last year, there were a lot of folks who were saying we may not get to what we did in 2016," said Robert Grenda, a senior vice president with Morningstar Credit Ratings LLC. "There was some real concern about risk retention."\par \par \uc2 But underwriters have "gotten pretty comfortable" with the new rules, Mr. Grenda said. "We haven't seen a significant impact on volume."\par \par \uc2 The record year for new commercial mortgage-backed securities was 2007, when there were $314 billion of new issues, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: China's Big Banks Still Have a Credibility Gap\par \par \uc2 By Anjani Trivedi\par \par \uc2 For China's big banks, business is looking better than it has in years. Investors shouldn't be fooled by the act.\par \par \uc2 Midyear results for the likes of ICBC and Bank of China show China's regulatory crackdown over the last year has had some success in whipping banks into shape: Interest income rose and asset quality improved for all of the so-called Big Four. Under pressure to clean up their shadow-banking activities, banks have reined in a key profit engine, noninterest income. Fees and commissions from off-balance sheet investment and wealth-management businesses plummeted in the second quarter.\par \par \uc2 Still, going back to basics isn't proving simple. The four banks are able to earn a roughly 5% yield on new loans, while their funding costs remain lower than those of smaller rivals. That should mean easy profits, but the big banks' average return on assets was just over 1% in the first half, partly thanks to high operating costs, and partly because of still-high loan impairment charges.\par \par \uc2 Together with declining fee income, poor profitability is harming banks' capital positions. With little to add to retained earnings, bank capital levels are growing slowly. Their assets, meanwhile, are growing fast as they expand their loan books. The net effect is that their capital ratios\u8212\'20\'14bank capital divided by risk-weighted assets\u8212\'20\'14are declining. Bank of China's core equity Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio fell to 11.8% from 12.3% a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 More optimistically, banks' bad-loan positions seem to be improving\u8212\'20\'14although again, the good news is qualified. The improvement is partly a game of numbers: Total loans have been growing faster than bad loans. Moreover, big banks have found creative ways to dispose of soured debt. Bank of China has been securitizing some of its bad loans, while others have carried out debt-for-equity swaps or just transferred them into off-balance sheet entities.\par \par \uc2 Chinese bank stocks are up 17% so far this year, and now trade at 0.9 times book value on average. Anyone hoping they can push higher still should take a closer look below the surface.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street Migrates to \u8216\'20\'18T+2\u8242\'20\'32 Settlements\par \par \uc2 By Chris Dieterich\par \par \uc2 Anybody who sold shares Tuesday is guaranteed to receive cash for their trade by Thursday \u8212\'20\'14 a day earlier than any point during the past two decades.\par \par \uc2 That's because Tuesday marks the first day that trades in most financial products in the U.S. will be required to "settle" within two business days, rather than in three days as has been in place since 1995.\par \par \uc2 The settlement process finalizes trades, transferring money from buyers to sellers in exchange for ownership of a security. In industry jargon, Tuesday is the first day of the "T+2\u8243\'20\'33 era, which supplants "T+3."\par \par \uc2 A large group of financial firms and other market participants have pushed for the shortened settlement cycle for years. They argue that risk is lessened for brokers and investors alike when money moves more quickly between buyers and sellers. Since the global financial crisis nearly one decade ago, the financial industry and regulators alike aimed to reduce systemic risk within the financial system. Shortening the settlement period would reduce the risk that one party in a trade experiences financial distress and is unable to complete settlement obligations, industry participants say. It also means that investors will receive their money or shares faster after making a transaction.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  finalized rule changes to facilitate the shorter settlement cycle in March.\par \par \uc2 The new settlement timeline applies to stocks, exchange-traded funds, corporate and municipal bonds, among other financial products. Canada also is transitioning from T+3 world to T+2, aligning markets in North America with others across the Atlantic. Most \uc2 European Union\uc2  member states harmonized their settlement cycles to T+2 in 2014.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Transcript: Q&A With Fed Governor Lael Brainard\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Board governor Lael Brainard took audience questions Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2017, following her speech at an Economic Club of New York breakfast. She discussed the labor market, inflation, the Fed's balance sheet and financial regulation, among other topics. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity.\par \par \uc2 (Applause.)\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: OK, thanks very much. Well, let me ask the first question, just about unemployment. It did \u8211\'20\'13 it is very low, of course, but it did have \u8211\'20\'13 it did tick up during the last reporting cycle, with fewer jobs added then than expected. Any concerns about that as we move forward?\par \par \uc2 LAEL BRAINARD\uc2 : So I would anticipate that we will see some effect, in particular from Hurricane Harvey, in the payrolls reports. But we expect those to be \u8211\'20\'13 or, at least I expect those to be somewhat short-lived. Overall, the labor market picture I think is a very positive one. We're continuing to see margins of slack diminishing. And so in the last report, even though unemployment did tick up a small amount, we also saw some welcome improvements in (the share of people holding part-time jobs who say they would prefer full-time work) coming down. We've seen discouraged workers coming back into the workforce. So it does suggest that there may still be some margins of slack, as does the still low level of the overall employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers, which really controls for some of the demographic shifts, which is still a noticeable 2 percent below where it was before the crisis.\par \par \uc2 Q: First of all, I appreciate your remarks very much. The inputs to inflation of labor and capital seem to be offset more and more by technology. And when you look at the \u8211\'20\'13 for example, the big three automakers, their revenues are identical to the revenues of the FANG stocks ( \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Amazon, Netflix and \uc2 Google\uc2 ). But the FANG stocks represent one-tenth of the employees of the big three companies, and represent 50 times more their market cap. So the question I have is, is the ability to measure inflation in the context of a technological disruptive period such that you can't really measure the deflationary effects going on from the internet and other technological innovations going on?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I think the question that you raise about do we fully understand the impact of technological innovation on how inflation is measured and really what those measures represent is a \u8211\'20\'13 is a very important question. I think there's a lot of discussion, a lot of research going on in this area at the moment. It's certainly the case that the mechanisms that we have \u8211\'20\'13 that the (\uc2 Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 ) uses, for instance, for undertaking quality adjustments as products change over time or when new products are introduced \u8211\'20\'13 that there are some complicated measurement issues there.\par \par \uc2 And so this is an area that bears close watching. It may well be impacting, for instance, our measured productivity. There may be a difference between what we're measuring in terms of productivity and what the underlying rate of productivity growth actually is. It's not clear whether those differences are greater now than they may have been, for instance, you know, in the late '90s, when we also saw a big surge of technological innovation. But the relationship between innovation, technological innovation, wage setting, and inflation, I think is one that we need to continue to pay very close attention to.\par \par \uc2 Q: My question is regarding the normalization of the balance sheet. Academics, researchers, and even on occasion \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  banks, have blogged that the growth in the Fed balance sheet has exacerbated income inequality in the United States. And, first of all, I'd like to ask, while income inequality is not one of your dual mandates, do you consider that? And do you agree or disagree with that assertion or those pieces of research? And secondly, as you are \u8211\'20\'13 as the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  has indicated that it will lead the balance sheet normalization with the mortgage side of the balance sheet. And do you have any concerns that by doing so you may be limiting housing finance availability for the middle class?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So the questions about income and wealth inequality in the U.S. and how do they figure into policy makers' thinking, clearly at least in my own mind I pay very close attention to the trends in income distribution, in part because I think they matter for the robustness and the resilience of our economy, because they matter for the \u8211\'20\'13 who is receiving the bulk of the income and their likelihood of spending that may be quite different. So it does matter as we think about the overall resilience of the economy. It certainly mattered going into the crisis, where the financial health and stability of households at the lower end of the income distribution mattered for the overall stability of the system.\par \par \uc2 Do I think \u8211\'20\'13 have I seen evidence that the balance sheet may in some respect be contributing to that? I think these are very longstanding trends. And those trends long predate the use of unconventional monetary policy in the U.S., the asset purchases. And they, I believe, have much deeper causes. This goes back to some of the technological questions that were asked earlier. And the sets of policies that are appropriate to address them are really well outside the realm of the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's tools, or the specific objectives that Congress has set us.\par \par \uc2 With regard to the balance sheet normalization plans that the (Federal Open Market Committee) has agreed, as you know, the balance sheet runoff has specific caps that are set separately for Treasurys and for (mortgage-backed securities). In my own view, those are set and increase over time gradually, and in a way that should be well-anticipated, and that will give the ample space for private markets to be able to fund those securities going forward. So I think that the plans that were announced were \u8211\'20\'13 took into consideration a number of important characteristics and do carefully and gradually and predictably allow the balance to runoff in a way that should really be well anticipated and well managed by the markets.\par \par \uc2 Q: Governor, thank you for sharing your insights with us. And also, thank you for your longstanding service. Coming out of Jackson Hole, and you just echoed it also right now, that when you look at the reforms that were put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis \u8211\'20\'13 whether it was capital, liquidity, risk management, derivatives market, transparency, or money market reforms \u8211\'20\'13 overall they have contributed \u8211\'20\'13 this is the finding coming out of Jackson Hole, and you repeated it \u8211\'20\'13 towards the sustained economic growth that we are seeing. I'm curious if, within the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , you have also done any studies that you could speak to in terms of the hampering effect or the dampening effect on the animal spirits, which is a structural component of powering risk-taking end growth. I would be curious of any studies have been done to the counterfactual, not to what you are speaking to. Thank you so much for your thoughts.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Yeah. So, thank you. I think that there's been a lot of work done, both \u8211\'20\'13 and by policy researchers as well as academic researchers \u8211\'20\'13 both focused on the U.S. only as well as on the international financial system, asking the question as to whether asking the largest, most systemic, most complex institutions to hold more robust capital buffers, to stress-test those capital buffers, to better risk-weight the assets that they're holding those buffers against, to better manage their liquidity and to better risk manage whether that may in some respects impede the flow of credit to the economy. Now, animal spirits is a somewhat different question, although I think we've seen very robust readings, certainly of confidence of consumers and more broadly.\par \par \uc2 With regard to credit, you know, if you look in the U.S. economy, credit is flowing. Credit is really very available by \u8211\'20\'13 in all of our surveys that we've undertaken recently. You would be hard-pressed to find cases where credit is not readily available to qualified borrowers. And standards in some cases have been tightened, but in those instances I think we had first seen a bit of a deterioration in underwriting standards, for instance, in (commercial real estate). So my sense is that for the institutions at the core of the system, their ability to lend has actually been supported by the rigorous reforms they've undertaken.\par \par \uc2 Now, I think there are some institutions who \u8211\'20\'13 the community banks or smaller banks in particular \u8211\'20\'13 who, by virtue of the way that the statute is written, got caught up in some of the reforms, that perhaps are not necessary or useful for their particular business models. And there, you know, I think there is scope for statutory changes. And here I'm thinking about Volcker or incentive comp or stress testing, depending on what the size and the complexity of that institution is.\par \par \uc2 So, do I think there are also ways that we could right-size those regulations? Absolutely. And that it would allow smaller financial institutions, supervised institutions in particular, to be more active in lending. I hope that there will be an opportunity to make some of those changes.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you for a very interesting talk, particularly on inflation. Most of your comments \u8211\'20\'13 I haven't heard that much on inflation from a Fed person for a long time.\par \par \uc2 We've had about 20 years of experience now with inflation-indexed bonds. And one of the principal arguments in bringing them out \u8211\'20\'13 not the only one that has been modestly useful in asset management \u8211\'20\'13 but also the information context, the wisdom of the market would show us where inflation was headed and could you comment on how you appraise the usefulness of that asset class?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So, I can't appraise it from an investor's point of view. But I can say that when we are trying to gauge inflation expectations and we're looking at market-based measures, that asset class proves extremely important, because we look at the difference between inflation Treasury yields and non-inflation index to try to get a sense of what kind of probabilities the markets are placing on inflation coming in above target, inflation coming in below target over different horizons. And we also look at other market-based measures, but that is one of the key measures that we look at.\par \par \uc2 And, of course, there are different liquidity characteristics in those markets. And so, you know, it's not a straight read on expectations. I don't take it as such. I don't think any of us do. But it is one useful indicator, along with a host of other indicators \u8211\'20\'13 some survey-based, some model-based \u8211\'20\'13 that does help us gauge whether, in fact, there may be some change in inflation expectations. And certainly, based on those markets, it does appear, in fact, that market participants are putting a somewhat lower probability on high-inflation outcomes and a somewhat greater probability on low-inflation outcomes. And it suggests that, in fact, there has been a noticeable change in inflation expectations, a decline since the precrisis period. And it's certainly something that I \u8211\'20\'13 that I focused on over the last few years.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you very much. Where do you stand on the debate in the FOMC currently on financial conditions? It seems to me that wanting to wait for inflation to be in the rearview mirror runs the risk of running a monetary policy that is very accommodative for maybe longer than necessary. And in the meantime, boosts asset prices to levels that might be of concern. So wouldn't you agree, like, the one participant mentioned in the last minutes that continuing to hike as per the dots would strike the right balance between achieving the inflation mandate and guarding off against risks from too loose financial conditions? Thank you.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I think financial conditions are an extremely important consideration for all of us as we look at the appropriate path of monetary policy. In particular when financial conditions ease, that contributes to a stronger economy, may well contribute to a more robust outlook for inflation. And so it's certainly something that materially factors into the outlook.\par \par \uc2 The separate question is whether we should be undertaking monetary policy to target financial conditions. And there, I think you can also see in previous minutes of FOMC discussions that there has been quite a bit of discussion \u8211\'20\'13 robust discussion \u8211\'20\'13 where the minutes will suggest that people generally in the committee believe that we have other tools that are our first line of defense against buildup of financial imbalances, and that the tools that we have in the wake of the crisis are much, much more robust than we had going into the crisis. Moreover, we have a much more systematic and rigorous quarterly review of potential financial imbalances, potential financial stability concerns, so that the board, which is responsible for most of those nonmonetary policy tools, and the FOMC in turn now have regular and systematic looks at financial stability.\par \par \uc2 So, while it is something that I think is a concern, and I have noted in previous remarks that in the past two episodes, when unemployment reached very low levels, it was in fact financial imbalances that were the primary concern rather than accelerating inflation. Again, though, we have generally taken the view that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense. And that's why the robust macroprudential tools that we have as a result of Dodd-Frank and tools such as the countercyclical buffer, which is now a tool that is also out there that we can use, have been so important to our ability to focus monetary policy on the dual mandate.\par \par \uc2 Q: I had two questions if that's OK, the first revolving around the balance sheet. When and if the announcement comes, how do you view further announcements of the reduction versus FOMC hiking interest rates? So if the reduction is, for example, X, and then it's done a second time, at what point would you revisit, then, hiking the (federal-funds) rate?\par \par \uc2 And the second question was you mentioned the 40 basis points of term premium. I was just curious how \u8211\'20\'13 if there's a certain quantity or how you guys think about that if, for example, after the first announcement, is that viewed as, let's say, a 5-basis-point tightening. Just any color that you're comfortable sharing.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I think the first important thing to just say is that the plans that were agreed by the FOMC essentially lay out a path for the balance sheet on both types of securities that is \u8211\'20\'13 once it is initiated is \u8211\'20\'13 essentially can be thought of as going on autopilot: that it's completely laid out, that it is capped, and of course there is complete transparency around the (system open market account) portfolio so that market participants will be able to correctly anticipate exactly how that balance sheet runoff will proceed.\par \par \uc2 Now, there was \u8211\'20\'13 and again, let me just say my own view is that we know so much about how the federal-funds rate works \u8211\'20\'13 we have decades of experience, tons of empirical estimates \u8211\'20\'13 and really most of the estimates that we have regarding asset purchases are very recent, and we're in the midst of a large, protracted period of, you know, economic challenges, so that it does not provide as much predictability to the public. So that my preferred instrument, my preferred active instrument \u8211\'20\'13 and I think this is consistent with the plans that were laid out by the FOMC \u8211\'20\'13 would be to use the federal-funds rate and to calibrate that to economic conditions as they evolve. Now, of course there is some consideration in those plans, and it certainly would be true of my own thinking that if the economy were to evolve very differently \u8211\'20\'13 if we were to see large adverse developments \u8211\'20\'13 at that juncture there may be some reason to slow or change the balance sheet runoff policy. But that would be under very different circumstances.\par \par \uc2 That was your first question. Let me see. Was there a second question?\par \par \uc2 Q: It was basically how you think about the additional term premium that might be created \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Oh, so the term premium \u8211\'20\'13 yeah. So the one thing I would say is those estimates, too, they're out in the public domain. They are primarily based on event studies during periods of asset purchases. Whether those estimates are the appropriate, you know, sort of neighborhood of magnitudes during a period of runoff I think is an open question. They give us some sense of what we might expect to see in terms of the term premium. But I think it's fair to say, at least in my mind, those estimates are \u8211\'20\'13 come from a sufficiently different period that I don't know. And I will be watching very carefully \u8211\'20\'13 I'm sure everyone else will be as well \u8211\'20\'13 to see whether the effects differ materially enough that it may have implications for how to think about the federal-funds rate path. But at least going into it, those are the \u8211\'20\'13 those are some of the least-most well-understood estimates that are out there.\par \par \uc2 Q: You have a great deal of expertise in the fields of globalization and trade, not only from your academic research but also as a practitioner \u8211\'20\'13 for example, your time in the Treasury. I wonder, how would proposed or existing changes in U.S. trade policy arising from the rise of populism affect the way that you are thinking about achieving your goals as a Fed governor \u8211\'20\'13 whether, for example, its impact on the labor market, impact on the dollar, how those things could drive inflation or other effects.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I would say that generally the \u8211\'20\'13 to the extent that, you know, there are big policies that are, you know, being enacted of any sort, we would want to take into account, to the extent one could estimate the impact on our dual mandate, that would obviously be a conditioning factor in how we think about the appropriate path of policy.\par \par \uc2 From where I sit today, you know, the economy actually looks \u8211\'20\'13 as I said earlier, growing is continuing. Trade flows have actually improved a bit. Net exports are making a positive \u8211\'20\'13 small positive contribution for the first time in several years. And so, you know, now, there could be some disruptions associated with Harvey, but generally speaking the policy environment that we're taking into account has some fiscal uncertainty about it, but really those \u8211\'20\'13 geostrategic uncertainty \u8211\'20\'13 but those would be the main sources of uncertainty as I think about the policy arena. And that the implications for monetary policy, you know, if we were to see different kinds of policy shifts in the future, obviously, those are ones that I would take into account at that time.\par \par \uc2 Q: You've mentioned several times the happy condition of growth occurring elsewhere in the world simultaneously. Could you say a bit more about how durable you see those external sources of growth, as well as the risks that are drawn to your attention?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Yeah. So what we have seen is after several years of (\uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2 ) and others having to mark down global growth forecasts, what we have recently seen is actually the IMF and others marking up global growth forecasts. And this is on the back of stronger growth in several of our major economies around the world around the same time. So obviously the euro area activity and labor market readings have come in somewhat stronger than anticipated, and that's very welcome. Japan has recently come in a bit stronger, Canada, and then China. Now, of course there are risks to those outlooks, but I a year ago would have said that a major downside risk to our outlook really came from abroad, and I would say today that balance of risk has really shifted.\par \par \uc2 In China, in the medium term I think there are risks associated with the trajectory of growth. We've seen a rapid buildup of corporate debt in particular. We've seen some house-price increases in areas. And we, I think, would anticipate that the underlying trend growth rate is going to come down over time. And how the authorities manage to deal with those financial imbalances while also converging on a sustainable growth path is something that I think could be a risk for the medium term. We know that we have some changes in the relationship between Britain and the EU that are being discussed, and so that has some medium-term risks to the global outlook as well. And, as I said earlier, there's some geostrategic risks out there.\par \par \uc2 But the core growth outlook has improved really quite notably over the last two years in a way that I think now is contributing positively to the U.S. economy, which is extremely welcome.\par \par \uc2 Q: My question is to pull back from the micro and to ask you what you think the role of monetary policy should be eight and a half years into an economic expansion. And you've laid out a scenario where perhaps the suppressed rate of inflation is a global phenomenon, perhaps outside the direct impact of the Fed, and that the preferred policy tool is the fed-funds rate. So my question is, when it is appropriate for the Fed to perhaps shift its focus from trying to fine-tune the rate of inflation to building in protection or building in enough room for monetary policy to have a real impact on the economy the next time it falls into recession?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I think it's a very tricky question to ask if, in fact, the neutral (interest) rate has come down and is likely to remain low for some time. And as I said earlier, I think there are a variety of reasons to believe that it is low currently and that it's likely to remain low for some time. In those circumstances, the room for maneuver above our effective lower bound using conventional policy is inherently limited. And so, you know, as a monetary policy maker, you're \u8211\'20\'13 you know, you've got a very clear objective of achieving sustainably the dual mandate, full employment and 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis. And so that is the guidepost for our policy.\par \par \uc2 Now, it's actually more important than ever that we get to that symmetric 2 percent inflation goal if, in fact, the neutral rate is lower because that gives us as much room as we are going likely \u8211\'20\'13 future monetary policy makers are likely to have in terms of being able to buffer adverse shocks above the effective lower bound. So I think the real underlying question is, you know if we are in fact in a low neutral rate environment and are likely to be for some time, achieving that 2 percent goal is more important than ever. And the question is, you know, how do we get from here to there? So that's really been the focus of my thinking recently, and over a longer horizon as well.\par \par \uc2 Q: Governor Brainard, do you see a trend or at least an increased likelihood of a lessening in international regulatory cooperation among the (\uc2 Group of 20\uc2 ) countries going forward, and a trend toward each country wanting more capital in its borders and each country going it alone?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I certainly think \u8211\'20\'13 you know, putting on my old hat, when I was responsible at the Treasury Department for negotiating some of the international agreements that led to more harmonization, I certainly think it's in America's interest that we do level the playing field to the greatest extent possible and level up that playing field internationally. You know, we learned in the crisis, we've learned through several crises right now that we are not immune to financial instability abroad, particularly in some of the larger financial jurisdictions. We've seen that in the last few years, when concerns about banks that may not have had sufficient capital reverberated into our financial markets at a time when our banks were actually building capital and looking a lot healthier.\par \par \uc2 So it matters to our financial resilience and the health of our economy that financial institutions abroad are just as \u8211\'20\'13 you know, just as risk-tested, just as well-capitalized, husbanding their liquidity just as carefully as U.S. institutions are. It's simply \u8211\'20\'13 it seems to me simply self-interest to make sure that the world is working together around a set of, you know, sort of similar regulations that look a lot like the ones we have here.\par \par \uc2 Q: Let's go back to the international, if it's \u8211\'20\'13 if it's OK. I worry about how much growth internationally \u8211\'20\'13 and especially look at Europe, for example \u8211\'20\'13 is really due to so much central bank liquidity versus fundamental issues. So, for example, in Europe we all know that there's still \u8211\'20\'13 and I realize the IMF came out with their, you know, more positive report, but we all know that the real structural reforms have not really been fully implemented. (Non-performing loans) are very high still in those countries. And I worry in particular about the emerging economies, where one of the reasons they were not impacted negatively during the most previous crisis was because they had really revised their debt-management strategies \u8211\'20\'13 largely, you know, local currency as opposed to U.S. dollar currency, as well as extending the duration and so on. But we have seen \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 because of low rates they have really increased not only on the corporate level, but also at the government level U.S. dollar-denominated debt again. So I worry, A, have the fundamental structural issues been resolved? And, B, what's going to happen with all these emerging economies who now have lots of U.S. dollar-denominated debt as normalization occurs, as the dollar, you know, increases again, is this all setting up for sort of a(n) unhappy ending?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So the kinds of risks that you pointed to I think are ones that, you know, have been highlighted by some of the financial stability reports that international organizations have done. It's certainly something that we think a lot about, potential financial spillovers into the U.S. market, and try to figure out where those risks may come from.\par \par \uc2 There is a risk in a(n) environment such as this that you could see behavior that does lead to financial imbalances, and there's a risk that you could see complacency that leads to a slowing down of structural reforms. Obviously, you know, we think that the reverse is preferable. And that's why here in the U.S., again, you know, we put in place a number of difficult structural reforms in the financial system. That process was a difficult and challenging process. But now that we're on the other side of it, I think we can feel more confident that there are guardrails and risk buffers in the economy that should serve us well. And I would hope that other countries move forward on the same kinds of structural reforms so that we also would see less risks abroad.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 J.P.

Sandy was supposed to be a big test, but NY, NJ and some other states said the deductibles didn't apply because Sandy's winds lost hurricane status before arriving in their borders. Harvey was Category 4 in hitting Texas, seemingly giving the state no wiggle room on this front for helping consumers, insurance experts said. (leslie.scism@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Why Harvey Isn't Socking Home Insurers: \u8216\'20\'18Hurricane Deductibles'\par \par \uc2 Private-sector home insurers got a break when Harvey's Category 4 winds landed in a relatively thinly populated part of Texas coastline. Winds dropped off sharply as Harvey moved inland, a big reason home insurers face estimated claims of less than $3 billion. Another reason: Many policies contain special "hurricane" or "windstorm" deductibles that ratchet up policyholders' share of rebuilding costs. The deductibles often are 5% or so of the insured value, not the claim. So if a home insured for $200,000 sustains $10,000 of hurricane damage, a 5% deductible saddles the policyholder with the entire $10,000, a Texas government website for consumers explains.

The \uc2 iShares China Large-Cap ETF\uc2  (FXI) has rallied over 26% this year, but the sector faces a number of headwinds, says \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 . There could be a leadership change, and the Trump administration's stance toward China remains uneasy, writes the firm's Mandy Xu in a note. "We could see further hardening in the Trump administration's stance toward China, particularly if China keeps up its support of the North Korean regime," she says. Trump has already threatened to cease trade with China. Expected volatility for the China large-cap ETF has been rising along with geopolitical tensions in the region, but remain relatively muted. Xu recommends buying options on FXI to protect against a downturn.

After toll road operator Jasa Marga last week listed securities on the local exchange, now another state-owned company, Indonesia Power, is seeking to raise up to IDR4 trillion to fund the construction of several power plants. The listing is the first part of the company's plans to raise as much as IDR10 trillion by securitizing its assets through the end of 2018.

That's a big change from the previous model, in which clients paid for research indirectly through the execution of trades or through the "spread," the difference between financial products' buying and selling prices.\par \par \uc2 The rules will apply to all banks doing business in the EU, including U.S. banks operating in the bloc.\par \par \uc2 Before the rules were approved by the EU's executive arm in 2016, banks protested the portion of legislation that would define research as an "inducement," saying such a move wasn't what lawmakers intended and it could block smaller clients' access to top-quality research.\par \par \uc2 But Markus Ferber\u8212\'20\'14the German lawmaker in charge of Mifid II, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, in the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14said this is exactly what he and his colleagues had in mind.\par \par \uc2 He told The Wall Street Journal that the entire idea was to unbundle research costs, making them transparent and no longer paid for as part of the brokerage commission. "Once prices become transparent, fund managers have to make a conscious decision about what to buy and what not to buy," Mr. Ferber said. "That will ultimately drive down prices."\par \par \uc2 Banks are now scrambling to find a price point as they negotiate with clients. \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2  halved the \u8203\'20\'0Bproposed\u8203\'20\'0B\u8203\'20\'0B \u8203\'20\'0Bprice of its fixed-income and macro research to \u8364\'20\'AC30,000 ($36,000) a year for as many as 10 users\u8203\'20\'0B, from an initially planned \u8364\'20\'AC60,000, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-23/deutsche-bank-is-said-to-halve-mifid-fixed-income-research-price"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bloomberg reported last month}}}\uc2 , citing people with knowledge of the bank's plans.\par \par \uc2 A couple of years ago, the rule against inducements caught investment banks off guard. The way the draft laws were written, it wasn't clear if "morning macro" notes summarizing market moves\u8212\'20\'14bread and butter for salespeople\u8212\'20\'14would fly under the new standards.\par \par \uc2 In what was seen as a concession, the EU's executive arm, the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , clarified that bespoke research containing so-called original insights had to be paid for directly, but banks could continue to offer market commentary as a complimentary service.\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0BUp until now, this is how it worked: A salesperson on a bank's rates or currency team would bring along a top research analyst from the same bank to meet a hedge-fund manager. With a fund investing in, say, French bonds, the salesperson would book lunch with the head of French rates research\u8203\'20\'0B\u8212\'20\'14perhaps in Mayfair,\u8203\'20\'0B the upscale London neighborhood hedge funds call home.\par \par \uc2 After wining, dining and chatting about the future of the French economy, the hedge-fund manager knew he had to pay for that research expertise. But the price wasn't clear. There was no fee. Subsequently, the hedge-fund manager would execute a few trades and throw some business over to the bank.\par \par \uc2 As of next year, investment banks will have to rely on a standalone business model to support fixed-income research that clearly stipulates pricing. Interested parties on both sides will be watching to see how it all shakes out.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 SEC Chief Wants Investors to Better Understand Cyberrisk\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chief-wants-investors-to-better-understand-cyberrisk-1504651526"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission}}}\uc2  said Tuesday that regulators and Wall Street need to do more to educate investors about the serious risks that companies and the financial system face from cyberintrusions.\par \par \uc2 Jay Clayton, speaking at an event sponsored by \uc2 New York University\uc2 's School of Law, said investors still don't fully appreciate the threat posed by hackers. "I am not comfortable that the American investing public understands the substantial risk that we face systemically from cyber issues and I would like to see better disclosure around that," Mr. Clayton said.\par \par \uc2 Some cybersecurity experts have in the past called for the SEC to require more specific disclosures by U.S. public companies about cyberrisks, particularly following a 2013 breach at \uc2 Target Corp\uc2 . that compromised the credit- and debit-card information of millions of customers.\par \par \uc2 Fired Wells Fargo Managers Sue Over Sales Scandal\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fired-wells-fargo-managers-sue-over-sales-scandal-1504647699?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Two former managers have sued}}}\uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., claiming they were unfairly fired over the bank's sales-practices issues.\par \par \uc2 Reza Razzaghipour and Marla Razzaghipour claimed their dismissals were retaliation for them raising issues with senior managers about the questionable sales practices, such as falsification of bank records, according to a lawsuit filed Aug. 31 in Los Angeles Superior Court.\par \par \uc2 The former managers, who are husband and wife, were fired in March from positions overseeing regions in Southern California.

Investors shouldn't be fooled by the act.\par \par \uc2 Midyear results for the likes of ICBC and Bank of China show China's regulatory crackdown over the last year has had some success in whipping banks into shape: Interest income rose and asset quality improved for all of the so-called Big Four. Under pressure to clean up their shadow-banking activities, banks have reined in a key profit engine, noninterest income. Fees and commissions from off-balance sheet investment and wealth-management businesses plummeted in the second quarter.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street Migrates to \u8216\'20\'18T+2\u8242\'20\'32 Settlements\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/09/05/wall-street-migrates-to-t2-settlements/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Anybody who sold shares Tuesday is guaranteed}}}\uc2  to receive cash for their trade by Thursday\u8212\'20\'14a day earlier than any point during the past two decades.\par \par \uc2 That's because Tuesday marked the first day that trades in most financial products in the U.S. will be required to "settle" within two business days, rather than in three days as has been in place since 1995.\par \par \uc2 The settlement process finalizes trades, transferring money from buyers to sellers in exchange for ownership of a security.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc84}{\*\bkmkend toc84}\b \uc2 The Property Report: European Mall Operators Are Upbeat --- Demographics, design and relative scarcity have helped Continent weather downturns\b0\par\par\uc2 By Esther Fung \par \uc2 1,093 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 September 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)\par \uc2 WSJE\par B9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 As in the U.S., the retail world in Europe has been turned upside down by the brave new world of shopping that enables you to buy practically anything while sitting in your pajamas at the computer or waiting in line with your phone.\par \par \uc2 But the pain to European retail landlords has been less severe.\par \par \uc2 Shares of listed European retail real-estate companies have fallen but not as far as their U.S. counterparts. Values of European malls and shopping centers continue to rise in some European markets while they are falling throughout the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. landscape is pockmarked in many regions by empty and near-empty shopping centers. In Europe, there are fewer such "dead malls," analysts say.\par \par \uc2 "Europe is not the U.S.A.," said Paris-based commercial-property company \uc2 Unibail-Rodamco SE\uc2 , in a first-half earnings-presentation in July.\par \par \uc2 Why not?\par \par \uc2 The main reason that analysts cite is that Europe didn't experience the retail-development boom that the U.S. did in the 30 yearsleading up to the 2008 crash.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S., there are 24 square feet of retail space for every man, woman and child in the country compared with five square feet in the U.K., four in France, and three in Spain and Italy, according to data from the \uc2 International Council of Shopping Centers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It's a completely different scale," saidDavid Ironside, chief investment officer of \uc2 LaSalle Investment Management\uc2 's continental European business. LaSalle's private-equity group owns 242 retail assets in U.K. and continental Europe. "You don't get into a distressed zone that quickly in Europe."\par \par \uc2 But there are other reasons besides moderate supply that explain why European landlords have been more sheltered from the retail storm. These reasons are now being studied closely by retail investors, developers and lenders as they look for opportunities and risks on both sides of the Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 One factor buffering European landlords is mall layout. Shopping centers in Europe are typically anchored by a grocery store, rather than a department store, which tends to be the norm in the U.S. Grocery stores bring in a lot of foot traffic. Department stores have been among the biggest victims of online shopping.\par \par \uc2 U.S. malls and shopping centers also are being hit harder by a recent spate of retailer contractions and failures. Department stores such as \uc2 Macy's\uc2 , \uc2 J.C. Penney\uc2  and \uc2 Sears\par \par \uc2 have announced closures of more than 400 stores across the U.S. since August 2016, hurting many secondary malls that are struggling to find replacement tenants.\par \par \uc2 Retailers in Europe currently are healthier, in part because many of the weaker ones failed during the financial upheaval between 2008 and 2009 and between 2011 and 2013, said Hemant Kotak, analyst at \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We had a cleansing process in the last downturn and what survived were the better concepts and the ones with the better financial positions," said Mr. Kotak.\par \par \uc2 One of the retailers that filed for bankruptcy in 2012 is fashion chain Peacocks, which was subsequently sold to another retail group that has since expanded Peacocks' stores.\par \par \uc2 Not every European landlord is doing better than those in the U.S. Some top U.S. mall companies, such as \uc2 Simon Property Group\uc2  and \uc2 GGP Inc\uc2 ., are popular with retailers and are recording rent growth and low vacancy rates comparable to the numbers being chalked up by leading European landlords.\par \par \uc2 Some trends in Europe aren't as promising as in the U.S. For example, Europe's population growth has been lackluster, which doesn't bode well for future increases in retail sales.\par \par \uc2 Still, investors are keenly aware of the advantages of Europe. In the 12-month period ended in July, the FSTE NAREIT Equity Regional Malls Index, which tracks seven mall REITs in the U.S., skidded 32%.\par \par \uc2 During that period, the Stoxx Europe Total Market Retail REITs, which tracks net returns of seven mall landlords in the region, declined a more-modest 11%.\par \par \uc2 Sales of U.S. shopping centers also have fallen sharply.\par \par \uc2 Volume totaled 670 million square feet between 2015 and the end of this June, according to an analysis of deals in excess of $10 million by data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . By comparison, some 790 million square feet traded hands between 2012 and 2014, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 In Europe, deal activity increased to 627 million square feet in the 18 months period ended in July, up from 559 million square feet in the previous period, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 Investors are particularly hungry for shopping centers in Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, which are politically stable and whose economies are still growing.\par \par \uc2 In March, U.K.-based \uc2 Intu Properties PLC\uc2  acquired Xanadu shopping center in Madrid and its management company for 530 million euros ($630 million).\par \par \uc2 Klepierre SA\uc2 , the second-largest pan-European REIT and the largest to specialize in shopping centers, acquired a shopping mall in Spain's Murcia area for 233 million euros, and is redeveloping Hoog Catharijne, a mall in Utrecht, the Netherlands.In April, \uc2 Klepierre\uc2  opened 16,000 square meters (172,250 square feet) of new shops and restaurants in Hoog Catharijne and is scheduled to deliver more space in subsequent phases in November, March and 2019.\par \par \uc2 "We will continue to buy shopping centers in big cities and get rid of the ones in small cities where demographics are decreasing," said \uc2 Jean-Marc Jestin\uc2 ,chairman of Klepierre's executive board, in an interview. The France-based landlord is looking at shopping centers in the top three to five cities in each country in the eurozone where the population is growing and in areas connected to public transportation. "We don't like suburban retail," Mr. Jestin said.\par \par \uc2 Supply has been kept in check in Europe partly because city planners have protected downtown shopping areas from suburban competition. In many places, people prefer to take public transportation, bike or walk, weakening demand for malls with large parking lots.\par \par \uc2 The one exception in Europe that faces a cloudier outlook is the U.K., which has more online shopping than countries on the Continent and faces uncertainties from Brexit. A weakening pound that has yet to fully flow through to consumers could exacerbate pressures on them, especially if the housing market remains lackluster and interest rates rise, said \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2  in a report in August.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170906000008"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170906ed9600007\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  is the latest to sound the alarm bells over \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said Friday in a meeting with students that "the one who becomes the leader in this sphere will be the ruler of the world," according to an Associated Press account. "It would be strongly undesirable if someone wins a monopolist position."\par \par \uc2 Silicon Valley's tech leaders, certainly fans of monopolistic technology positions, have been voicing concerns about AI, too. Last month, 116 founders of robotics and AI companies {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://futureoflife.org/2017/08/20/killer-robots-worlds-top-ai-robotics-companies-urge-united-nations-ban-lethal-autonomous-weapons/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 signed an open letter}}}\uc2  to the United Nations urging it to address lethal autonomous weapons, or killer robots, and ban their use internationally.\par \par \uc2 But regulating AI isn't a simple task. As a result, diverging viewpoints have emerged on how to manage the technologies that emerge.\par \par \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  has come out strongly in favor of regulation. "Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated," he wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in August. "AI should be too."\par \par \uc2 That didn't sit right with some. "AI on its own will not be a danger to humans for the foreseeable future." wrote Reza Zadeh, a professor at Stanford and the founder and CEO of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  startup Matroid."AI combined with weapons, maybe. So, regulate weapons, not AI."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zadeh said by email that "regulating AI is like regulating mathematics or physics."\par \par \uc2 Pursuing broad AI regulation has pitfalls: Any U.S. regulation that would slow AI advances could put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage on the global stage in terms of national security and financial prospects.\par \par \uc2 Then again, we just witnessed {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the effect of Facebook}}}\uc2  in the U.S. presidential election, so maybe it's time to take a harder look.\par \par \uc2 Write to Scott Martin at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Scott.Martin@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Scott.Martin@wsj.com}}}\uc2 Twitter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/scottysmartin?lang=en"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 @scottysmartin}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170905ed950018r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Many investors are trying to pinpoint the exact day on which the bull market eventually reaches its top. My advice to them: Stop.\par \par \uc2 I say that not because it is difficult to predict when the stock market changes direction -- though that is true, too. But there's an additional reason: Stock-market tops typically are a gradual rolling-over by the market rather than a sharp trend reversal. Some market averages will hit their peak months before or after others, and individual sectors can behave differently than the market as a whole.\par \par \uc2 In other words, the top doesn't occur on just one single day, or even in one week or one month. Even if you successfully predict the precise day, or week or month, on which a particular market average hits its top, you can still lose money -- or leave a lot of it on the table -- because other market averages and sectors likely aren't at their peaks.\par \par \uc2 This is an important insight not just for market historians. With the stock market up more than 300% from its March 2009 lows, and with the economy in its ninth year of recovery from the latest recession, many investors worry that a bear market is overdue. Rather than anxiously trying to determine the exact day when to shift out of stocks, they should instead view market tops as a gradual process in which equity exposure is slowly and deliberately reduced over time.\par \par \uc2 Take the 2007 bull-market top. The most widely followed market benchmarks, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index, hit their highs on Oct. 9 of that year, and that is the date that most market timers record as the "top" of the 2002-07 bull market. Yet the Russell 2000 index, a widely used proxy for the small-cap sector, registered its top on July 13, three months prior. The Dow Jones Utility Average topped out even earlier, on May 21. And some sectors began their bear markets even longer before; the \uc2 SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF\uc2 , for example, hit its bull-market high in December 2006.\par \par \uc2 What this means: Pinpointing that Oct. 9 top wouldn't have been very helpful unless you were investing in the S&P 500. In the event you were investing in the average small-cap, utility or regional bank, among others, you would have lost money if you had waited until Oct. 9 to sell.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most spectacular example of a divergence at a market top, however, came when the internet bubble burst. Though the S&P 500 topped out on March 24, 2000, and didn't hit bottom until October 2002, the average small-cap value stock actually rose during that bear market, according to data from University of Chicago professor Eugene Fama and Dartmouth professor \uc2 Ken French\uc2 . So small-cap value investors left a lot of money on the table by going to cash during the 2000-2002 bear market.\par \par \uc2 Divergences this stark and spread out aren't unusual at market tops, according to David Aronson, a former finance professor at \uc2 Baruch College\uc2  and now president of Hood River Associates, a research firm that uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to enhance stock-market trading systems. "The process of topping out can take a really long period of time, evolving over a year or more," he told me in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Take the end of the bull market in the early 1970s, for example. Though the S&P 500 didn't hit its high until January 1973, major divergences "started to manifest as early as the spring of 1971," nearly two years prior, he says.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, Mr. Aronson adds, "market bottoms tend to be sharper." The bottom at the end of the 2007-09 bear market is a good case in point: Virtually all major averages hit their bear-market lows on March 9, 2009. Most individual sectors did so also, and those that didn't mostly hit their bottoms only a few days before or after. As Mr. Aronson argues in a just-published book, "bottoms are easier to identify, in real time, than tops."\par \par \uc2 Instead of trying to pinpoint the day of a particular market's average top, therefore, you might want to focus on the prospects for the individual stocks or mutual funds that you own. Bragging rights for calling the top of this or that market benchmark mean little if your stocks or funds start declining months before that top.\par \par \uc2 One helpful focus would be on internal market divergences between different sectors of the market. A healthy market is one in which most stocks are participating. As divergences emerge and become more pronounced, odds increase that the stocks you own may suffer even if the major market averages such as the Dow and S&P continue rising.\par \par \uc2 By the same token, you need to be alert to the possibility that your individual stocks will continue to rise even if the major averages begin a major decline.\par \par \uc2 It's worth noting in this regard that some potentially worrisome divergences have materialized in recent months, according to Hayes Martin, president of Market Extremes, an investment consulting firm that focuses on market turning points. In an email to me, he pointed out that there have been some significant divergences among groups that historically have been reliable "coal-mine canaries," such as small banks, which peaked on March 1, and smaller-cap stocks, which have been "battered" since late July. This suggests to him that we are probably in a long-term topping process.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Aronson agrees, though he says it's unclear from his work whether the coming top will precede a major bear market or something of more intermediate-term significance.\par \par \uc2 Regardless, these divergences suggest that risk is elevated. We may want to focus more on which stocks or funds we would want to sell to reduce our equity exposure rather than what we'd buy to increase it.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hulbert is the founder of the -Hulbert Financial Digest and a -senior columnist for MarketWatch.

As associate director for the MBA programme at Cass Business School in London, she must manage the expectations of high achievers about where their business school degree will take them.\par \par \uc2 One student arrived in her office distraught after being rejected by a large investment bank from its fast-track management programme. They were offering just 15 places worldwide, Ms Robinson recalls.\par \par \uc2 "People think an MBA is a golden ticket , when it is not," she says.\par \par \uc2 Landing a job after business school has never been straightforward. But a \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  survey could shed light on the process. The anonymous poll reveals what skills leading employers want - and what they don't - from MBA graduates. Read the methodology at FT.com/work-careers.\par \par \uc2 Our findings suggest students should prepare themselves for a changing MBA jobs market. Our subsequent conversations with employers found graduates should be realistic about the roles for which their MBA degree alone will qualify them.\par \par \uc2 One in three of the employers we surveyed said they struggled to find business school graduates with the right skills.\par \par \uc2 The five most important skills were not core MBA subjects, such as finance and marketing, but more loosely defined qualities, or so-called soft skills, such as the ability to work with a wide variety of people (cited by 76 per cent of employers) and the ability to prioritise (cited by 72 per cent). Of these, employers said the ability among MBA graduates to manage their time effectively was the most difficult to find.\par \par \uc2 The findings may be explained in part by a perception gap. Employers in some sectors, such as oil and gas, civil engineering, transport and energy, see little need for senior staff to hold an MBA degree. Part of the reason, they say, is that they do not believe that business schools teach the right skills.\par \par \uc2 Business schools are reacting by trying to broaden the pool of MBA employers. At \uc2 Chicago's Booth School of Business\uc2 , technology companies such as Amazon and \uc2 Google\uc2  have overtaken management consultancies and investment banks as the biggest hirers in recent years. The school is looking for new sectors in which companies may be interested in hiring their MBAs.\par \par \uc2 Julie Morton, associate dean of careers services and corporate relations at Booth, says half her team of 22 are employed specifically to spread the word about the value of hiring MBA graduates. Many of the companies new to hiring MBA graduates are interested in soft skills, such as the ability to network - one of the most important skills cited in the FT survey, Ms Morton adds. The trick is convincing companies that MBA students have them. "We work with companies all the time where the MBA is not the goal," Ms Morton says.\par \par \uc2 Several employers told the FT that MBA qualifications were not their priority. At Servest, the facilities management company, four people in senior posts have MBAs. But the company, which employs 51,000 people across the UK and South Africa, did not seek MBA graduates to fill any of these roles, according to Dennis Zietsman, Servest's deputy chairman.\par \par \uc2 "It's the type of person rather than the business degree that we focus on," he says. "[MBA graduates] have never been our star performers."\par \par \uc2 Some joining the company with business masters degrees have struggled to convert theory into practice, he says. "Case studies in the MBA programmes seem to be based on big corporates, often American, which cannot be applied to smaller corporates that have cultures different to those that they've studied."\par \par \uc2 Neither are MBA graduates a priority for the clients of Mark Butter, director of Blueprint Recruitment Solutions, a company that specialises in executive appointments for the oil and gas, marine, civil engineering, transport and energy sectors.\par \par \uc2 "They are far more likely to be concerned with whether the candidate has industry qualifications, such as being a chartered engineer," Mr Butter says.\par \par \uc2 Adrian O'Connor, founding director of Global Accounting Network, which helps with appointments of qualified accounting professionals up to finance director level, says an MBA is a "nice to have" rather than a sought-after qualification.\par \par \uc2 Some clients will accept an MBA instead of an accounting qualification, Mr O'Connor notes. "This is particularly true in either the more commercial finance roles, or indeed at board level."\par \par \uc2 The FT research suggests there may be an opportunity for business schools to market graduates more effectively among companies not used to hiring at this level. Even among Mr O'Connor's clients, the perception is that business school graduates are good at networking - listed in our survey as among the five most important skills to employers.\par \par \uc2 "Clients view it as a strong testimonial of someone's intelligence and ability to apply that," Mr O'Connor says.\par \par \uc2 Ilona Drozd is campus recruiter for the online travel site \uc2 Expedia\uc2  in Europe. The company became interested in hiring MBAs for senior strategy roles in part because many of its board directors were MBA graduates, Ms Drozd says.\par \par \uc2 Despite this, \uc2 Expedia\uc2  does not have a specific graduate programme for recruits with an MBA. This year the company, which employs more than 20,000 people worldwide, hired just nine MBA graduates in the UK and three in the US.\par \par \uc2 The most common reason for rejecting applicants coming in at the senior level, where an MBA graduate would typically aspire to start within an organisation, is a lack of cultural fit and an inability to solve complicated problems, according to Ms Drozd.\par \par \uc2 Soft skills, such as teamwork, are important but they are not enough, she adds. "The ideal candidate is someone we would like to have long term, which means they have to really want to work at \uc2 Expedia\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Kevin Marvinac is both an MBA graduate and chief operating officer at TransparentCareer, a database of salary data for people hired from business schools, which is aimed at helping MBA graduates hone their search to find the ideal job.\par \par \uc2 He believes that an MBA is helpful in securing a rewarding senior executive role, but admits that it is not sufficient in industries where people are also expected to have certain technical skills or experience. The FT survey found \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis, for example, was one of the hardest skills to recruit.\par \par \uc2 "It is really hard to be a product manager at a tech company, for instance, if you don't know how to code," Mr Marvinac says.\par \par \uc2 Speaking candidly: what employers say\par \par \uc2 'Business schools must continue to focus on and emphasise analytical hard skills, such as programming languages, because most companies will be using \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  to extract insights from internal and external sources. What tends to be missing is the ability to translate these insights into opportunities' 'Too much tactical execution and not enough big-picture thinking' 'Often, MBAs do not have much patience. When companies hire them, the MBAs have been off the market for between one and two years. It takes time to integrate and learn about a new company' 'MBAs hear very often that they are special during their courses - when coming back to business, reality often hits them hard' 'The ability to deal with ambiguity is missing'\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170904ed940001m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc92}{\*\bkmkend toc92}\b \uc2 Mifid II will deliver overdue value for money; THE LAST WORD\b0\par\par\uc2 By Norma Cohen \par \uc2 813 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 September 2017\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 Surveys FNM1\par 08\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Some of the headlines seem shocking. "Star research analysts to be hawked for $5,000 an hour" ran a recent one in this publication, reporting on new rules for the fund management industry that are set to upend business models across Europe and beyond.\par \par \uc2 On the face of it, the rules - requiring sellside companies to separate their charges for execution services out from those charged for access to research - appear to be a blow not only to the fund management industry but, by extension, to the pension funds and retail investors that are their ultimate customers.\par \par \uc2 However, analysts and consultants familiar with both the buy- and sellsides of the investment industry see things differently. While the European legislation, known as Mifid II, will pose significant challenges for fund managers, it will also force them to make changes to the way they conduct business that may ultimately benefit end investors. The change is long overdue.\par \par \uc2 Take the requirement to unbundle the purchase of research services, says Nicola Beattie, founder of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy specialising in helping buy- and sellside companies to improve interaction. Under current practice, end clients pay for research; returns to investors are net of brokerage commissions. "Free" research to fund managers is effectively paid for by their clients. Fund managers "are not going to pay more for research than they used to pay", Ms Beattie says, "but now it will come out of their own profit and loss account." That, in turn, could mean higher returns for pension schemes. Already some of the biggest names in fund management have announced their intention to do just that, including \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  , Aberdeen and Jupiter.\par \par \uc2 But the second iteration of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive is not simply about forcing the unbundling of services whose costs were previously hidden from investors. In particular, the onus will be on fund managers themselves to ensure that they receive best execution - the sale and purchase of investments at the best available price. That is good news for end clients. Getting the best price for a security on purchase or sale should improve returns to end investors.\par \par \uc2 The US-based \uc2 Tabb Group\uc2 , which produces research on the buy- and sellsides of the industry, notes in a recent research report that it is not just Mifid that is forcing fund managers to focus on best execution. Massive outflows from actively managed funds in light of high charges and poor returns and their resettlement into passive management have also contributed. That shift represents end investors effectively voting with their feet and moving to platforms where value for money is more certain.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Mifid is about competition, choice and value for money. And it is not just Europeans who will feel its effects. Roughly 76 per cent of US fund managers surveyed by Tabb expect to fall under some Mifid rules, and they are gearing up for them. Tabb found that 37 per cent of fund managers have initiatives to improve routing to venues where best execution can be achieved, as well as initiatives aimed at improving the reporting of best execution. This contrasts sharply with a 2016 survey that found only a fifth of those surveyed were making best execution and its measurement top priorities.\par \par \uc2 This is no small matter, Ms Beattie says. "I see instances where the sellside is not getting the best price for the buyside." Not all brokers will have trading arrangements with every exchange where specific securities are dealt, meaning it may cost more for Broker B to acquire a line of stock than it would Broker A. But when investment houses no longer feel obliged to trade through Broker B because of some ancillary service that is provided but not explicitly paid for, end investors can make better choices on trade execution.\par \par \uc2 The thorny issue of transaction cost analysis (TCA) is climbing up the ladder of US fund managers' priorities, even as European regulators grapple with how it should be measured and reported, according to Tabb. Fine-tuning their TCA \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  is a top concern for roughly a quarter of the 95 fund management groups in the survey. Regulators take note: if asset managers are measuring their own transaction costs, there is no reason these should not be disclosed.\par \par \uc2 Adapting to the changed environment may involve hefty upfront costs for fund management groups. Companies that cannot afford this investment in technology may be forced out of business. But, overall, the drive to achieve the best price for the customer and to make it clear to customers exactly what they are paying for can only be a good thing for end investors. Better late than never.\par \par \uc2 Norma Cohen is the FT's former demography correspondent and is a PhD candidate at Queen Mary University of London\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170904ed9400013\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Subsequent comments, a negative deposit rate, and eventually asset purchases known as quantitative easing all led the euro on a nose dive from about $1.40 in March 2014 to $1.05 one year later.\par \par \uc2 The ECB faces a similar situation now. The single currency exceeded the $1.20 mark last week, sparking concern about whether a stronger currency will depress consumer prices, thus endangering the ECB's effort to push inflation up closer to 2%.\par \par \uc2 Will Mr. Draghi and top ECB officials react as they did in 2014?\par \par \uc2 It will be harder for them to do that for the simple reason that speaking against the euro today wouldn't be backed up with dovish action. There is a clear direction in policy toward less monetary policy stimulus, which is bullish for euro investors. Only an unlikely reversal in this policy would allow the euro to weaken.\par \par \uc2 "We imagine the ECB would scream were EUR/USD to near 1.25 over the next couple of months," wrote ING in a note. But the comments would have to be backed up by a significant delay in reducing bond purchases to reverse the euro rally, it added.\par \par \uc2 Still, the ECB faces the dilemma that it appears to be gradually changing policy toward less stimulus despite inflation being still short of the target. The ECB will reveal Thursday how far off the mark inflation may be. Frederik Ducrozet of Pictet expects the ECB to cut its 2018 inflation forecast to 1.1% from 1.3% and its 2019 forecast to 1.5% from 1.6%.\par \par \uc2 The further shortfall from the just below 2% target likely would add pressure to the ECB not to move too rapidly to the exit, as this would put further upward pressure on the euro. This makes it even more likely that the ECB won't announce any detailed plans to reduce its asset purchases Thursday, thus shifting the focus to its Oct. 26 meeting.\par \par \uc2 So if investors or reporters read a speech with complaints about the strong euro, it will not be unprecedented, but there is doubt whether it will be effective without a much more significant turn in policy.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments Around the World\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Jobs Report Won't Alter Immediate Fed Plans, but Doesn't Solve Inflation Puzzle\par \par \uc2 A solid if {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/analysis-jobs-report-wont-alter-immediate-fed-plans-but-doesnt-solve-inflation-puzzle-1504274416"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 slightly weaker hiring report}}}\uc2  for August is unlikely to change the Federal Reserve's immediate plans to initiate the slow runoff of its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. But the internals of Friday's Labor Department report could magnify the debate over how aggressively the central bank should move forward with rate increases because, at the margins, the data give less reason to worry about the economy overheating. Fed officials have been willing to look past softer inflation pressures because they expect a tighter labor market ultimately will force employers to raise wages and prices. But because Friday's report doesn't show a further decline in labor slack, it may reduce the pressure some officials will feel to raise rates.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Hiring Slows in August, Unemployment Rate Ticks Up\par \par \uc2 The U.S. labor market {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-hiring-slows-in-august-unemployment-rate-ticks-up-1504269227"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cooled in August}}}\uc2  with the pace of hiring easing and the unemployment rate edging up from a historic low. Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 156,000 in August from the prior month, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% from 4.3%. Wage gains remained stuck at the recent modest growth rate. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 179,000 new jobs and a 4.3% unemployment rate last month.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/august-jobs-report-labor-employment-analysis"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  Recap: Economy Adds Fewer-Than-Expected Jobs }}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2017/09/01/august-jobs-report-the-numbers-4/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  August Jobs Report, by the Numbers }}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2017/09/01/the-august-jobs-report-in-eight-charts/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The August Jobs Report in Eight Charts}}}\par \par \uc2 New York Fed\uc2 's Dudley Investigated, Cleared Over Wells Fargo Disclosure\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-feds-dudley-investigated-cleared-over-wells-fargo-disclosure-1504289320"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 investigated this year}}}\uc2  for failing to disclose a relative's employment at \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . and was cleared of any wrongdoing, the regional Fed bank said Friday. The \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  said Mr. Dudley noticed in April an "unreported position" related to a sibling and \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , as part of the annual process of disclosing his financial interests as required by law. Mr. Dudley's half-sister was a product management executive for the financial firm, the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  said. The \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  said Mr. Dudley "identified and recognized his omission and immediately notified" bank leadership. That disclosure triggered an investigation. The \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  said an external law firm reviewed his tenure at the regional Fed bank for any "potential conflicts of interest" related to \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 . The law firm found the failure to disclose the connection was "inadvertent," and found no sign that the \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  connection affected any of his activities.\par \par \uc2 Eurozone Factory-Gate Prices Stall for Sixth Month, Posing Quandary for ECB\par \par \uc2 The prices of goods leaving the eurozone's factory gates {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-factory-gate-prices-stall-for-sixth-month-posing-quandary-for-ecb-1504515805"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 haven't risen since January}}}\uc2 , indicating continued weakness in inflationary pressures, despite a firming economic recovery. The ECB's economists will publish new forecasts Thursday. Some analysts expected them to lower their projections for inflation in 2017 and 2018 to reflect the euro's appreciation against other major currencies over recent months.\par \par \uc2 Quick Hits: Euro Could Be in Focus at Next Week's ECB Meeting\par \par \uc2 Analysts weigh in on what to expect from the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 's policy meeting next week, the August U.S. jobs report and when the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  might raise interest rates. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/quick-hits-euro-could-be-in-focus-at-next-weeks-ecb-meeting-1504293054"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Here are quick hits}}}\uc2  on central banking and related market views from around the world.\par \par \uc2 MONDAY\par \par \uc2 N/A\par \par \uc2 U.S. markets closed for Labor Day\par \par \uc2 TUESDAY\par \par \uc2 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT)\par \par \uc2 Reserve Bank of Australia\uc2  releases policy statement\par \par \uc2 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT)\par \par \uc2 Fed's Brainard speaks on economic outlook and monetary policy to Economic Club of New York\par \par \uc2 1:10 p.m. EDT (1710 GMT)\par \par \uc2 Minneapolis Fed\uc2 's Kashkari speaks at \uc2 University of Minnesota\uc2  in Minneapolis\par \par \uc2 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT)\par \par \uc2 Dallas Fed's Kaplan speaks in Dallas\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Machine Learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  at Central Banks\par \par \uc2 Chiranjit Chakraborty and Andreas Joseph {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2017/swp674.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 review the underlying sources}}}\uc2  applying \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to economic and policy problems in a \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  paper.

"Another blowout jobs number might have undercut doves on the Federal Open Market Committee who would like to slow down the pace of interest-rate increases until there were signs of stronger wage growth and inflation. After all, unemployment already is at the theoretical level that sparks price pressure. But if payroll growth is indeed cooling off then the Fed can focus on hard data without worrying about labor market slack and could well be on hold for the rest of 2017."\par \par \uc2 For the ECB, There's Only So Much Time to Play For\par \par \uc2 With the path of the ECB's bond-purchase program set only until the end of December, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-the-ecb-theres-only-so-much-time-to-play-for-1504454400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the pressure to lay out plans for 2018 is building}}}\uc2 , writes Richard Barley for The Wall Street Journal. "The ECB might yet play for more time in September, but that will just put the focus on October," he writes. "The stumbling block for the ECB is the euro, which has risen steeply. That is likely to dent the ECB's new inflation forecasts, making communication about policy trickier. Many other developments, however, point toward a eurozone that no longer needs the ECB to hold the policy accelerator to the floor."\par \par \uc2 Brazil's economy posted a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-gdp-rises-in-second-quarter-on-rebound-in-consumer-spending-1504268720"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 second consecutive quarter of growth}}}\uc2  on the back of a rebound in consumer spending, reinforcing hopes for a recovery from the country's deepest recession on record.\par \par \uc2 A measure of U.S. consumer sentiment {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-sentiment-rose-in-august-1504275629"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rose in August}}}\uc2 , a positive sign for household spending heading into the fall.\par \par \uc2 Manufacturing activity in the U.S. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-factory-sector-activity-hits-six-year-high-1504275294"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reached a six-year high}}}\uc2  in August, with factories continuing to register a big rise in sales and boosting hiring in response.\par \par \uc2 Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 The chief investment officer at Winton Group Ltd., one of the world's largest hedge funds, quit to set up his own firm.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Beddall worked at Winton for about 17 years and is one of the best-known managers of computer-driven hedge funds in Europe. He left Winton in August, according to regulatory filings.\par \par \uc2 He has set up Havelock London, a consultancy and investment-management business in which Winton plans to take a stake.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beddall, 37 years old, who has been on sabbatical in the U.S. for the past year, said in an interview Friday that his new firm will aim to use technology to manage money and give advice to clients.\par \par \uc2 Winton, set up by billionaire hedge-fund manager David Harding, runs around $30 billion in computer-driven hedge-fund strategies, much of which is based on trying to profit from trends in financial markets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beddall's departure comes as the hedge-fund industry is in flux. Many investors, tired of lackluster returns and some managers' inability to turn a profit, are increasingly looking to computer-driven funds to navigate markets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beddall, who is still a shareholder in Winton, is setting up Havelock with former Winton research director Kate Land, former Winton technology director Alisdair Wren, and Neil Carter, a former senior distribution head at \uc2 Jupiter Asset Management\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Winton said that since Mr. Beddall began his sabbatical, his role has been divided up among other Winton staff.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beddall said his new firm wouldn't compete with Winton or focus on trying to follow market trends -- one of the biggest areas of quantitative trading. He said one of his main areas of interest was investing based on securities' valuations, and that much of his own wealth is run in that manner. \b \highlight22\uc2 Machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  -- one of the hottest areas of computer-driven investing -- was useful in "specific circumstances," Mr. Beddall said, but it was "not prudent to leave a computer to it in an unspecified way."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170904000029"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170904ed940000s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc97}{\*\bkmkend toc97}\b \uc2 Finance & Markets: Storm Victims Check Fine Print --- Most home-insurance policies in U.S. exclude flooding; shortfalls in coverage expected\b0\par\par\uc2 By Leslie Scism and Nicole Friedman \par \uc2 797 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 September 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)\par \uc2 WSJE\par B5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Hundreds of thousands of Texas homeowners are expected to lack adequate insurance for repairing flooded houses, if they have it at all.\par \par \uc2 Many homeowners never examine details of the policies they buy, and it is only after a flood they learn the basics: Standard homeowners' policies provide payouts for damage from wind, fire, fallen trees and other storm-related events but not flooding. For that, people generally need to buy separate policies from the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2 , through its nearly 50-year-old National Flood Insurance Program.\par \par \uc2 As Houston residents started to return home Friday following Hurricane Harvey, many were for the first time checking the fine print on their insurance contracts and hoping for the best.\par \par \uc2 Among them was Andrea Womack, a 38-year-old mother of four. The carpet and some clothing in her one-story house in Houston's Settegast neighborhood were damaged by water. On Friday morning, Ms. Womack was waiting for an insurance company representative to come by and go through what was covered.\par \par \uc2 "I signed up for insurance awhile back, but on my papers it says it does not cover flood insurance. So I'm not sure" what will be covered, she said.\par \par \uc2 Early loss estimates are starting to show that Ms. Womack isn't alone.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 CoreLogic\uc2  has estimated total residential flood costs of $25 billion to $37 billion in 70 counties in Texas and Louisiana hit by Harvey. Of that, about 70%, or $18 billion to $27 billion, is uninsured.\par \par \uc2 Overall, households and businesses in Harris County, which includes Houston, held roughly 249,000 federal flood policies as of June 30, according to the \uc2 Federal Emergency Management Agency\uc2 . There are about 1.7 million housing units in the county.\par \par \uc2 Those homeowners who do have flood insurance are likely those whose mortgage lenders require it, said Etti Baranoff, an associate professor of insurance at Virginia Commonwealth University.\par \par \uc2 "The mortgage company checks if your home is in a flood zone or not, and they'll make you take" a policy out if so, she said.\par \par \uc2 Even so, those with the government flood policies aren't always made whole, she said. These policies pay out a maximum $250,000 for rebuilding and $100,000 for personal possessions.\par \par \uc2 Among homeowners with flood coverage are Sydney Truss and his wife, who live south of Houston in Friendswood, Texas.\par \par \uc2 When they were house hunting last year, the couple worried about possible flooding. So, before they settled on a home, they looked up whether it flooded during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001.\par \par \uc2 "That's kind of the storm Houstonians judge everything by," said Mr. Truss, 36 years old. "It did not flood during Allison." Even so, the couple's bank required them to get a federal flood policy.\par \par \uc2 "We're hearing you have to have [all the damaged items] to get insurance" claims paid, Mr. Truss said, surveying the piles of clothes, toys and books in his front yard. He said he was initially going to wait until he heard from insurance officials before clearing out the house, but "it would be a disaster if we kept waiting any longer."\par \par \uc2 Standard homeowners' policies do pay for some damage from water -- such as if it enters the house after the wind rips off the roof. But if water overflows a riverbank or gushes down a street to seep into a house, the homeowner can expect a claim to be rejected, according to industry lawyers.\par \par \uc2 The federal flood insurance program's payouts for Harvey appear on track to rival those made for superstorm Sandy in 2012, the U.S.'s third-costliest hurricane (behind Katrina in 2005 and Andrew in 1992). So far, 130,622 Sandy claims have cost the program $8.4 billion, an average of $64,331 apiece, according to the \uc2 Insurance Information Institute\uc2  trade group.\par \par \uc2 Overall, private-market insurance payouts for Harvey are expected to be dominated by payments to business policyholders and range from $10 billion to $20 billion.\par \par \uc2 A frequent area of dispute after hurricanes has been how much an insurer ought to pay in instances in which both winds and flooding damaged a property. Those disputes could arise in coastal communities where Harvey landed as a Category 4 hurricane with its strongest winds.\par \par \uc2 "If there is a breath of wind and breath of storm surge, that ought to be enough to put in front of the Texas courts and ask for relief for these people," said David Wood, a policyholder lawyer for corporate clients at \uc2 Barnes & Thornburg LLP\uc2  in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Erin Ailworth contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170904000027"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170904ed940000q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

He left Winton in August, according to regulatory filings.\par \par \uc2 He has set up Havelock London, a consultancy and investment-management business in which Winton plans to take a stake.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beddall, 37 years old, who has been on sabbatical in the U.S. for the past year, said Friday his new firm will aim to use technology to run money and give advice to clients.\par \par \uc2 Winton runs around $30 billion in computer-driven hedge-fund strategies, much of which is based on trying to profit from trends in markets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beddall's departure comes as the hedge-fund industry is in flux. Many investors, tired of lackluster returns and some managers' inability to turn a profit, are increasingly looking to computer-driven funds to navigate markets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beddall, who is still a shareholder in Winton, said one of his main areas of interest was investing based on securities' valuations.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  -- one of the hottest areas of computer-driven investing -- was useful in "specific circumstances," Mr. Beddall said, but it was "not prudent to leave a computer to it in an unspecified way."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170903000011"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170903ed9400004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600
