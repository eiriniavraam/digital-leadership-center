Most of these cards carry interest rates north of 20%, significantly higher than the average credit card interest rate of 14.1%, according to the Federal Reserve. Rewards programs, one of the biggest costs for large card issuers chasing creditworthy customers, are rare.\par \par \uc2 But risks abound: Facing rising loan losses, especially among the riskiest borrowers, banks are reining in their growth in this sector. Subprime credit-card balances at seven large U.S. banks rose 3% in the first half of the year from a year prior, down from a 13% increase in the year-earlier period, according to Autonomous Research. \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp\uc2 .'s subprime balances accounted for 32% of its domestic credit-card balances in the first half of 2018 compared with 36% in the same period a year earlier\par \par \uc2 The new lenders are getting help from some industry stalwarts. The Orogen Group, an investment firm headed by former Citigroup Inc. chief Vikram Pandit, said in May it was committing $100 million in equity to Fair Square, which distributes cards to borrowers with less-than-pristine credit scores. LendUp recently announced that Capital One co-founder Nigel Morris and former Capital One chief credit officer Frank Rotman were joining its board of directors.\par \par \uc2 The population of subprime borrowers "is nigh on half of America, and there's enormous opportunity for others to be able to offer a great product with great sophistication to compete in this space," Mr. Morris said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Fintech startups still account for a relatively small slice of the subprime-card market. At the end of 2017, Fair Square had 124,000 open accounts, more than half of which went to customers which prime credit scores at the time they were opened, and just shy of $95 million in balances for its Ollo card holders, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Capital One has around $32 billion in subprime credit-card balances on its books.\par \par \uc2 The new entrants say their use of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  for underwriting helps them manage the risk. They also mostly extend small credit lines, often ranging between $500 and $2,000, limiting the scale of potential losses.\par \par \uc2 Around 60 million U.S. adults have credit scores lower than 650, according to \uc2 Fair Isaac Corp\uc2 ., roughly the threshold where banks focused on prime borrowers stop lending. Some 53 million U.S. adults don't have credit scores at all because they have little or no borrowing history.\par \par \uc2 Fintech lenders have been targeting both groups, often using data not included in applicants' credit reports, such as how often they change addresses and whether they pay their utility bills on time, to determine whether to approve them.\par \par \uc2 Fintech startups looking to enter the credit-card business have a few challenges that banks don't. They typically must partner with banks to issue the cards on their behalf to comply with rules set by card networks \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Mastercard Inc\uc2 ., and they need a source of funding to lend against. LendUp, for example, uses \uc2 Transportation Alliance Bank\uc2  to issue its Arrow Card and has a $100 million line of credit from Victory Park Capital Advisors LLC, a Chicago-based investment firm.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20180814ee8d001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Vista's latest buyout fund will seek to take majority stakes in 15 software and data companies worth between $750 million and $10 billion, the document shows.\par \par \uc2 The fund has yet to set a hard cap despite returning to market earlier this year, the document shows, the latest sign of the increasing clout top-performing private-equity shops have in today's buoyant fundraising market.\par \par \uc2 Soaring investor demand means buyout funds can increasingly dictate terms during fundraising, in some instances not letting investors know how much they will seek to raise until the firm has held an initial or final close. Investors typically like to know how much a firm plans to raise at the outset so they don't find themselves backing a fund that is a lot bigger than expected.\par \par \uc2 Vista only set a hard cap on its previous fund after holding a first close in March 2016, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.\par \par \uc2 Other large-cap firms including \uc2 Advent International Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Cinven\uc2  and \uc2 Apax Partners\uc2  also began marketing their most recent funds without establishing an upper limit, WSJ Pro said in the same report.\par \par \uc2 Raising larger funds has become increasingly common in recent years as yield-starved investors turn to well-established private-equity brands in a bid to boost returns.\par \par \uc2 Carlyle Group LP\uc2  recently raised $18.5 billion for its latest flagship buyout fund, it said in a statement in July. Last year, \uc2 Apollo Global Management LLC\uc2  raised $24.7 billion\u8212\'20\'14the largest pool of capital ever raised by a private-equity firm.\par \par \uc2 The Oregon State document lists Vista's increasing fund size as one of several concerns.\par \par \uc2 One of the challenges it says it expects Vista will face is increasing competition for deals.\par \par \uc2 Rival private-equity firms and sovereign-wealth funds are attracted by the strong recurring revenue software businesses generate. Last year, deals for technology companies accounted for about one-fifth of all acquisitions globally, Dealogic Ltd. data shows.\par \par \uc2 "Vista was a first mover in a nascent market for software buyouts but\u8230\'20\'26 as new competition has arisen, there has been a step change in purchase prices for mature and profitable software companies," the document says.\par \par \uc2 Vista was founded in 2000 by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives Robert Smith and Brian Sheth.\par \par \uc2 The firm manages over $31 billion and has backed companies, including educational-software provider \uc2 PowerSchool Group LLC\uc2  and data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provider \uc2 TIBCO Software Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Since inception, the firm has invested approximately $19 billion in more than 70 deals, generating a net internal rate of return of more than 20%, the document says.\par \par \uc2 Write to William Louch at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:william.louch@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 william.louch@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20180813ee8d000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Baird & Co\uc2 . to weigh a sale, said people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The Alpine Investors-backed company is projected to generate more than $30 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2018, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 1979 by podiatrist Phillip Vasyli, the San Rafael, Calif.-based business designs supportive shoes, sandals and heels with the aim of melding style with footwear technology. Vionic makes so-called biomechanical footbeds that are designed to provide extra sole support. The company sells its shoes online and through retailers such as \uc2 DSW Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Zappos.com Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 QVC Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Alpine invested in Vionic in 2012. As an Alpine portfolio company, Vionic has rolled out new product styles and boosted its direct-selling capabilities by establishing its own stores, the first of which opened last year. It also appointed the former president of Deckers Outdoor Corp. unit UGG, Connie Rishwain, as its president in 2016.\par \par \uc2 "We're always exploring strategic and financial opportunities to help fuel our growth, but there is no active deal in place. We will continue to evaluate all our options to determine what is best for Vionic's exciting future," said Chris Gallagher, Vionic's chief executive. He didn't comment further.\par \par \uc2 The apparel-and-footwear category is becoming increasingly competitive. The retail market continues to evolve, driven by changing preferences among shoppers looking for unique fashion items. Makers of functional apparel and footwear with proprietary technology have fared better than the broader sector.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. footwear segment expanded retail sales 1.6% in 2017, generating $74.15 billion, compared with $72.97 billion in 2016, according to data provider \uc2 Euromonitor International Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Recent private transactions in the space include \uc2 Charlesbank Capital Partners\uc2 ' purchase of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/charlesbank-to-buy-bankrupt-rockport-for-150-million-1530729995?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Rockport Co.}}}\uc2  out of bankruptcy protection and Optimal Investment Group's acquisition of USA Dawgs Inc.\par \par \uc2 Alpine invests in companies in the software, consumer-services and business-services industries.

It's just changing.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Christina Binkley \par \uc2 1,601 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2018\par 03:01\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 While mall owners have faced record store closures and bankruptcy filings as more Americans shop online, \uc2 Taubman Centers Inc\uc2 . has doubled down.\par \par \uc2 It is reinvesting in design, technology, \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools and new store mixes for its 24 malls. One of the biggest overhauls is a $500 million revamp of the Beverly Center in central Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 The Bloomfield Hills, Mich., company is adding natural light, a chef-curated food hall and new luxury tenants. Taubman is also bringing in services for high-end clients through an armada of personal shoppers and the London-based concierge service Quintessentially, as well as analyzing consumer data with \uc2 OneMarket\uc2 , a retail-technology network.\par \par \uc2 Big-ticket moves such as these have been controversial. Some shareholders pressed for less-expensive strategies, and the dissatisfaction contributed to the election of activist investor \uc2 Jonathan Litt\uc2  to the company's board in May, replacing \uc2 William S. Taubman\uc2 , son of the company's founder. Mr. Taubman, known as "Billy," continues in his role as the company's chief operations officer.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Taubman argues that some of his competitors have spent much more\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Westfield Corp\uc2 . recently spent $1 billion revamping the Century City Mall in Los Angeles\u8212\'20\'14while others are failing to invest enough in the future of shopping.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Taubman sat down with The Wall Street Journal to discuss his strategy. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation.\par \par \uc2 A mall overhaul\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Let's begin with a bird's-eye view of what you're trying to accomplish with the redo of the Beverly Center. You're in a competitive shopping market, with the Century City mall having just finished its own very extensive makeover. And Rodeo Drive is 10 minutes away.\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: Let's go to 30,000 feet. I think what's most interesting about Beverly, and is representative of the future, is that Century City really focused their entire development around the department stores. The basis of our plan was everything but the department stores. We basically did nothing with the department stores. We just did something with everything else [such as mixing brands, and adding new food choices, signage and client services].\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Your reinvestment strategy has been controversial with some of your shareholders, and may have contributed to your replacement on the board in May. To what do you ascribe those investors' concerns?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: Reinvesting in Beverly Center was a generational decision necessary for it to keep its competitive position in one of the most important and growing markets. The property needed to be rethought and reimagined in order to remain relevant to the L.A. consumer and our significant Asian tourist business. The friction comes from the fact that investors are focused on short-term returns, but this transformational reinvestment will maximize the long-term value of the asset.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Why do you think this reinvestment strategy will be successful at a time when retail is generally experiencing something of a recession?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: Destination retail centers continue to improve and gain market share. They are not in a recession. Our efforts to reinvigorate the center are already paying off. As we mentioned on our recent earnings call, we're seeing materially improved traffic and sales productivity. Even with the project not yet completed, its sales per square foot has grown by double digits. If this trend continues, sales will reach historic levels this year.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: You're focused on a lot of brand stores\u8212\'20\'14smaller and more mixed. Is there still a need for anchor stores at malls?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: I use this analogy about the anchors. In the '60s and '70s, the three television networks\u8212\'20\'14ABC, NBC and \uc2 CBS\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14had like a 90% market share. Today, they probably have a 20% market share or a 15% market share, but they represent the cultural consensus of America. As opposed to cable, which is narrowcast.\par \par \uc2 Retailing has shifted like cable. There is still a function for the [traditional networks]\u8212\'20\'14it's just not the function it was. When my father was building shopping centers, anchors were guaranteed a certain sales performance and draw of customers because everybody did shop at the anchors consistently. That's now less true.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: How do you figure out what those narrowcast needs are in your shoppers?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: We did a year of market research. We embedded a videographer and an anthropologist into 40 different homes for five days. We videoed the customer as she made every decision. We lived with them to really understand why and what they were doing, and why did they come to Beverly or Century City? We saw that the decision making was complex. Food was incredibly important in her decision making. That's why we were so focused on the food at Beverly.\par \par \uc2 A full experience\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Everyone's talking these days about experiential retail. What does that mean for your malls?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: We're putting [clothing retailer] Canada Goose in [the mall in Short Hills, N.J.] They'll put a cold room in, it'll be 12, 13 degrees. You'll be able to put coats on and walk into the rooms to test out what they feel like. Indigo, we're bringing it in from Canada\u8212\'20\'14it's a 30,000-square-foot bookstore. The cooking department has a chef every evening and on the weekends, cooking, demonstrating. And we're bringing in [fashion retailer] \uc2 Brunello Cucinelli\uc2 . We haven't announced everybody we're bringing in, but there's just a whole bunch of new luxury retailers.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Luxury brands often want to be segregated from everyone else.\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: The luxury tends to want to be in its own [area in the mall, but they do] want to be near Apple. With the Beverly Center, we moved Apple up to the seventh floor; it's right next to the luxury zone.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Would you like to mix it up more?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: I would and I wouldn't: I do think that the Gucci shopper goes into Zara. Now, they buy different things in Zara than they buy in Gucci. On the other hand\u8212\'20\'14I have to be careful what I say here\u8212\'20\'14there are many midprice women's apparel stores that I actually don't think the Gucci shopper is shopping at. So, do I think she goes into Footlocker to buy a pair of shoes? Absolutely. She's not trying to replace her Christian Louboutins with Nikes, but she wants \uc2 Nike\uc2  as well, for another part of her life. So, I think that if the association makes sense for the customer, then it'll make sense for the retailer.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: You also get a lot of tourists at the Beverly Center. How do they even find it?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: We've been adopted by Chinese tourists, and we had a whole strategy for them. About nine years ago, we hired the marketing consultant that had helped Louboutin in China. We employ Chinese speakers in the information booth and take Union Pay [the Chinese international credit card]. Every Chinese student who arrives in L.A. for university gets a welcome package from Beverly with special benefits and an invitation to come see us and have a concierge to help them. Chinese students, we find, get a lot of family as well as friends, so there's a real spending opportunity with everybody who comes over to see them.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Are you adding new services for shoppers?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: Of course, we have Wi-Fi everywhere. That's sort of the price of admission today. In the Beverly Center, Quintessentially is our concierge service.\par \par \uc2 What happens is, you're a Chinese billionaire and you decide that you want to come to L.A., you want courtside seats for the Lakers, you want Michael Mina to cook you a meal, and you want a stylist. Your concierge will be able to plan that.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Is there any other infrastructure technology that you're looking at for the near future?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: We've signed up with Westfield for \uc2 OneMarket\uc2 . If \uc2 OneMarket\uc2  is successful\u8212\'20\'14and we're betting on it\u8212\'20\'14we believe it will create a marriage of the virtual and real world that will allow us to address customers one on one and make their shopping experience far more efficient. Ultimately, the major retailers will all have their inventory on the system, using \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So, when you get in your car and you say to Waze or you go into an Uber and you say you want to go to the Beverly Center, we're going to know that you've pinned a black dress on your picture app. And we'll be able to tell you, "By the way, that black dress is on the second floor at \uc2 Bloomingdale's\uc2  and we'll have Louise pull it out right now and put it in a fitting room, and we will take you directly to it."\par \par \uc2 WSJ: How soon do you think that's going to be real?\par \par \uc2 MR. TAUBMAN: I think two to three years. We're testing now.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Binkley is a writer in Los Angeles.

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 S ilicon Valley royalty received a visit from the real thing. Google co-founder \uc2 Sergey Brin\uc2  and venture capitalist \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  were among those meeting Crown Prince \uc2 Mohammed bin Salman\uc2  during his US tour in April. The budding relationship was on display again this week. The FT revealed that Saudi Arabia's wealth fund had spent $2bn to acquire almost 5 per cent of Tesla's stock. The mutual attraction is obvious. The crown prince has an agenda to transform his oil economy into an investing and tech powerhouse. For their part, tech groups, especially those burning cash, appreciate patient investors.\par \par \uc2 Yet the Saudi tech splurge is far more than meets the eye, while the glaring contradictions and obvious potential for disaster are swept under the carpet.\par \par \uc2 First, the sprawl. Japan's SoftBank has drawn a lot of attention for the size and volume of investments in tech, but remember that almost half of its $100bn Vision Fund is Saudi money. That means companies as diverse as Slack, the messaging app, and SoFi, the online lender, have Riyadh to thank, in part, for their surging valuations. WeWork, the shared office provider, received another $1bn this week; so widely is the fund sprayed around that the news barely registered.\par \par \uc2 For some companies, it goes further. Magic Leap, the consumer virtual reality company, has a direct investment from the Saudi Public Investment Fund. At Uber, the PIF acquired a 5 per cent stake in 2016 before SoftBank bought a 17 per cent stake for $9bn last year. That adds up to enough financial clout for real influence. Indeed, the PIF's Yasir al-Rumayyan sits on the ride-hailing company's board. Those are just the ones we know about. The Tesla revelation shows that Saudi Arabia is prepared to invest quietly in sizeable amounts which stay just below the disclosure threshold of 5 per cent. No other foreign government is close to building such a position in US tech.\par \par \uc2 US companies should not need reminding that the behaviour of this government is as distant from Californian values as it is possible to imagine. When Uber gobbled up the first investment from the PIF, women were still barred from driving in the kingdom. Only months ago, Saudi businessmen were locked up in Riyadh's \uc2 Ritz-Carlton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For all the crown prince's liberalising agenda, he leads a repressive regime waging a war abroad and beheading people at home. Given this, the embrace of investment by Silicon Valley's liberal elite might be their biggest act of hypocrisy yet.\par \par \uc2 No such qualms are expected from the Trump administration. But these are sensitive industries. SoftBank has stakes in companies such as \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 , the chip company for \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and virtual reality.\par \par \uc2 Stability is not guaranteed on either side. The Trump administration likes to blow hot and cold, even with allies; it has used its powers to block foreign investments, especially from China.\par \par \uc2 From the Saudi side, it was striking that officials \u8212\'20\'14 annoyed by the Canadian foreign minister voicing support for jailed rights activists \u8212\'20\'14 ordered their overseas asset managers to sell Canadian holdings. How soon could they tire of a tech sector which is slow to reciprocate with the hoped-for inward investment in Saudi Arabia? Whether this spending spree ends in boom, bust or fire sale, it will be something to behold.\par \par \uc2 tom.braithwaite@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Riyadh's behaviour is as distant from Californian values as it is possible to imagine\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180811ee8b000di\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Plenty of \uc2 Tesla Inc\uc2 .'s die-hard holders are prepared to stick with \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 , no matter if the electric-car maker is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-big-question-better-or-worse-off-as-private-company-1533751228?tesla=y&mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a public or private company}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "As long as it's an option for me to invest my money alongside Elon, I'm going to," said James Stephenson, who says he has been a Tesla investor since 2014.\par \par \uc2 Whether individuals and some institutional investors will be able to stay in Tesla will depend on how a deal is structured, though. Some holders of Tesla stock could face hurdles to participating.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk has said he wants {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-twitter-account-am-considering-taking-tesla-private-at-420-1533661152?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 to take Tesla private}}}\uc2 , giving investors a choice: stay with the company or sell their shares and receive $420 cash for each. The more shareholders who opt to stay, the less cash the company or any new investor would have to pony up.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/experts-cast-doubt-on-musks-envisioned-buyout-of-tesla-1533680027"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 And funding }}}\uc2 for a deal{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-go-private-dream-doesnt-add-up-1533677506?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  is a big question}}}\uc2 . Tesla, which has dwindling cash reserves and continues to generate negative free-cash flow, hasn't given any detail on how it would fund a buyout.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk tweeted "funding secured," but a later statement {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-board-has-met-several-times-to-discuss-going-private-proposal-1533736367?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 from several Tesla board members}}}\uc2  was less definitive. It said a meeting with Mr. Musk a week earlier had "also addressed the funding for this to occur."\par \par \uc2 Individual shareholders like Mr. Stephenson hold about 12% of Tesla's stock, according to FactSet, and many say they won't go. The 40-year-old financial analyst who lives in Florida said he wants to hold on to his Tesla shares, which he says number 169 and were worth around $60,000 based on Thursday's close.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not going to sell at $420, and most other Tesla shareholders I've spoken with aren't going to sell either," said Mr. Stephenson, adding he expects Tesla to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization over the next decade, versus around $60 billion today.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk said in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026890900885184514"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 one tweet this week }}}\uc2 that he would create "a special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla," but the car maker and Mr. Musk haven't elaborated on how such a vehicle would work. Usually, individual investors who don't meet certain income and asset criteria face steep regulatory barriers to participating in a buyout.\par \par \uc2 What's more, almost 8% of Tesla shareholders are index funds that follow benchmarks that exclude unlisted companies, according to \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 . Most of those would likely have to cash out since they can't generally hold stock not included in public markets or an index.\par \par \uc2 An additional 24% of shareholders are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that face limits on holdings of securities that don't trade easily. In most cases, they can't have more than 15% of their portfolio in illiquid securities.\par \par \uc2 These funds, which are among Tesla's biggest shareholders, have yet to say how they would react to a go-private transaction. \uc2 T. Rowe Price Associates\uc2 , Tesla's second-largest holder after Mr. Musk, with a 9.2% stake, declined to comment. So, too, did No. 3 holder \uc2 Fidelity Management & Research Co\uc2 ., with an 8.16% stake.\par \par \uc2 Baillie Gifford, the next largest holder, said in a statement: "As long-term shareholders, we will take time to reflect upon this development."\par \par \uc2 Vanguard Group\uc2 , which is Tesla's sixth-largest holder, owns shares mostly through index funds, which would likely have to sell. "Our active funds are technically able to invest in private companies, but it is rare for them to do so," a spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 Some smaller fund managers say they are on board. Craig Blanchfield, a portfolio manager at Mosaic Advisors, a money manager that oversees more than $241 million, said he wants to continue to hold Tesla shares. He said Tesla has already been a lucrative investment for him, as well as clients for whom he manages money.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Blanchfield added that Mr. Musk's penchant for success\u8212\'20\'14from revolutionizing payments with \uc2 PayPal Holdings Inc\uc2 . to building rocket company \uc2 Space Exploration Technologies Corp\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14is a key reason behind his plan to hold Tesla shares indefinitely. "This is an example of betting on the jockey, not the horse," said Mr. Blanchfield.\par \par \uc2 The $174.7 million \uc2 Ark Industrial Innovation ETF\uc2 , an actively managed fund from \uc2 Ark Investment Management\uc2 , is another committed bull. Tesla is its largest holding, accounting for 11.7% of the fund's portfolio, according to FactSet. Two other Ark ETFs own smaller stakes in Tesla.\par \par \uc2 "We think that $420 is a very low price to pay for Tesla today," said Tasha Keeney, an analyst with \uc2 Ark Investment Management\uc2 . The fund would prefer Tesla stay public because liquidity limits might push it to sell, but she argued that the market is underestimating the growth of battery-powered cars.\par \par \uc2 Factoring that in, Ms. Keeney estimated Tesla's shares could reach $4,000 in five years.\par \par \uc2 The scant detail provided by Mr. Musk has given pause to some steadfast supporters. Galileo Russell, a 25-year-old founder of a financial media startup, HyperChange, geared at millennials, views a take-private move as a "step backwards in terms of liquidity and transparency."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Russell conceded heavy short selling in Tesla stock, which entails investors betting a share price will decline, has been a distraction for the company, as Mr. Musk has said.\par \par \uc2 Investors who have placed wagers on Tesla shares falling have accumulated about $12.5 billion in short interest, making the electric-car maker one of the most shorted stocks in the U.S., according to \uc2 Ihor Dusaniwsky\uc2 , head of predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at S3 Partners.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not super convinced going private is the right move," said Mr. Russell. Still, he says he doesn't plan to sell any of his 60 shares, valued at about $21,000. "The financial upside could be huge. I'm holding this for 10, 20, 30 years at least."\par \par \uc2 For Prem Kalevar, a 29-year-old Canadian entrepreneur, Tesla's long-term potential isn't enough to mask liquidity concerns. Mr. Kalevar said he would sell a meaningful portion of what he says is his low six-figure holding that he has accumulated since 2013 if Mr. Musk takes the company private.\par \par \uc2 "Given the complexity and uncertainty of holding private company stock, my willingness to hold as large as a position as I do now would go down," Mr. Kalevar said.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Miriam Gottfried contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Michael Wursthorn at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Asjylyn Loder at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:asjylyn.loder@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 asjylyn.loder@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-boards-independence-is-tested-by-musks-buyout-idea-1533893403?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tesla Board's Independence Is Tested by Musk's Buyout Idea}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-has-made-inquiries-to-tesla-over-elon-musks-taking-private-tweet-1533757570?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=9"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SEC Probes Tesla CEO Musk's Tweets}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-flawed-plan-for-tesla-shareholders-1533807186?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=6"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Streetwise: Elon Musk's Flawed Plan for Tesla Shareholders}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-big-question-better-or-worse-off-as-private-company-1533751228?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tesla's Big Question: Better or Worse Off as Private Company}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-board-has-met-several-times-to-discuss-going-private-proposal-1533736367"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tesla's Board Has Met Several Times to Discuss Going-Private Proposal}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-tesla-claim-could-land-him-in-regulatory-trouble-1533681833"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Musk's Tesla Claim Could Land Him in Regulatory Trouble}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-twitter-account-am-considering-taking-tesla-private-at-420-1533661152"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Elon Musk Tweets He Is Considering Taking Tesla Private}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180810ee8a00232\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Richmond Fed chief talks about cryptocurrencies, cyberrisks and U.S. tensions with trading partners\b0\par\par\uc2 5,529 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 August 2018\par 17:42\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Central Banking\par \uc2 RSTPROCB\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin answered questions from the audience during an appearance in Roanoke, Va., on Wednesday, Aug. 8, 2018. He discussed cryptocurrencies, cyberrisks, the opioid crisis and U.S. tensions with trading partners, among other issues. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for clarity and length.\par \par \uc2 THOMAS BARKIN: (In progress) ... I focus on three big things. I spend a lot of time digging into the economy. As a guy who had a business background, I'm deeply respectful of economic thinking, but maybe not as fluent as folks who do it every day. I thought the only thing I was going to bring to the FOMC was to make sure that I had learned and be able to talk about economics in a way that was credible around the Federal Open Market Committee table. (Inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 in and of itself. I have been digging hard into economics and the economy.\par \par \uc2 The second thing I've been doing is digging into the district. And as I said, I've been everywhere now. (Inaudible.) But West Virginia's the place where we're going next month. But just trying to understand what's happening in cities and towns that \u8211\'20\'13 and some of the stuff I talked about today, the urban/rural split, that's not something I spent time thinking about six months ago, but it's something I spend a lot of time thinking about today. So trying to understand what's happening in our district.\par \par \uc2 And then the third part, I'd say, is just developing my own voice. As a competitive guy, if you show up around the FOMC table with the group of talented colleagues that I described, you want to be able to add value. And, you know, I'm hopeful that two things \u8211\'20\'13 that being able to talk about economic issues in the way that firms think is a distinctive value-add \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). So I've been pushing more on trying to do that.\par \par \uc2 Q: OK. How does the information that you learn through events and outreach opportunities like this help inform your view on monetary policy?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Oh, gosh, it helps a ton. So one of the challenges we have is we're trying to make really important decisions off of data that is by and large three months old and always revised. So, for example, we found out that the savings rate \u8211\'20\'13 three weeks ago we found the savings rate actually hadn't been 3.6 percent for the last year; it was 7 percent. So actually 3 percent to 6.8 percent, you know, shocking changes in the data. And so you don't want to go into the room, look at the data, and make a decision without trying to understand what's happening on the ground.\par \par \uc2 So one of the kind of things that my colleagues and I spend a ton of time doing is trying to test what we think we're seeing in the data with what's happening on the ground. If wage increases look modest in the data but you tell me they're massive on the ground, then I start asking some questions. If price increases look significant in the data but you say not that meaningful on the ground, fantastic. So I like to think that what we're doing is constant testing of what we see with what we hear. And I think the two of those put together give us the best chance to get an accurate view of what's happening in the economy.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: Along those lines, I imagine the questions that you have or look at maybe \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 get questions when you come to Fed meetings, conferences \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 several questions. The last time it was the way that you look at wages, but \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 seeing turnover, wage inflation. So that gives us an opportunity to hear more about what specifically is going on at that time, so.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: And I'm going to add, we meet every six weeks. You might not think that the economy changes that much every six weeks, but I'd say every time we meet there's new stuff on the table. In January, it was the tax cut. In March, it was the tariffs. And I might be wrong, but I think in April it was the Italian fiscal situation and what that meant for others, wages. I mean, so there's always something. So it's incredibly helpful to stay abreast of what's happening in the market, and why I appreciate \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 today.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: So, Tom, with regard to the economy, what keeps you up at night? (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: So, you know, we are many, many years into an economic expansion that, you know, started slowly but I think has started to gain some traction in the last couple years. I've been told by many people that economic expansions don't die of old age, they die of cardiac arrest. And so I'm trying to figure out what's the shock to the system that could, you know, put a stop or \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). You know, is it what's happening internationally? Is it a cyberrisk of some sort? Is it, you know, financial conditions? There are certain markets that are \u8211\'20\'13 that are leveraged or overleveraged.\par \par \uc2 But I think it's a hard job trying to forecast the future. And you know, if you decide that there's going to be a shock you're only right roughly one out of five times. But I do try to spend time thinking about what's around the corner, you know, that could put the brakes on what's been, I think, a very \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 virtuous circle.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: And if it's not a \u8211\'20\'13 not a cyberattack or something spectacular, where do you think the \u8211\'20\'13 where do you see the next recession could possibly come from?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Again, I think that confidence matters a lot in our economy. I think \u8211\'20\'13 if you go back to '09 to '12, I think there were businesses that, you know, for whatever set of reasons, weren't that confident in investing in \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). And I think we're just now seeing businesses start to make those investments. We're seeing investment come back. And I think that this \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 on business confidence would be \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 in consumer confidence. You know, do you feel like you've got a job, you've got enough money that you could spend a little money on your family or on yourself? Or do you feel like you're \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 paychecks \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible)? So, again, things that have to do with consumer confidence would be the same.\par \par \uc2 So, you know, I'm very focused on confidence and things that drive our confidence because if you take consumer spending, you could easily \u8211\'20\'13 and we've seen it happen \u8211\'20\'13 make a change in spending to saving like that if you start to feel nervous about the future. Businesses could \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 shareholders \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 the future like that. And so it is a wide range of things that could affect it, but I focus a lot on the confidence.\par \par \uc2 ... And consumer savings rate \u8211\'20\'13 you know, in addition to everything going down, businesses hunkered down, consumers hunkered down, people lost their jobs. There's a vicious cycle and a virtuous cycle. In '08, you saw the vicious cycle of people getting cautious all at the same time, which then, you know, made the economy contract even more.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: One more question. You touched on tariffs. Any idea where this might \u8211\'20\'13 the outcome might be on tariffs?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: No. No. So I think the most important thing to say right now is, you know, we're in the middle of a negotiation with a bunch of countries that could land on the spectrum all the way from fairer trade deals with a lot of, you know, countries that is a boost and a stimulus to the economy; to modest tariffs in many places that don't really hit the bottom line of the economy quite significantly; to a significant trade war that most economists say would be detrimental to the economy. I don't think anybody has any idea where it's going now ...\par \par \uc2 We're not seeing massive issues with economic performance today across the entire economy driven by, you know, the various trade \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). For sure, you know, we've had tariffs on steel that are driving prices up. For sure, these threatened tariffs on soybeans are driving soybean prices down. ... But it's a pretty big economy here, and across the whole economy I don't think we see a massive impact. So we're in that middle state, but it could go left or it could go right. We certainly don't know, or I certainly don't know, so.\par \par \uc2 Q: My question is regarding tariffs \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). How much of an impact does unfair trade practices impact the future of \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible)?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: So, again, economic theory would suggest \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 theory about free trade that presumes fair trade, all right, as opposed to unfair trade. Some of our predecessors made calls a number of years ago in the context of various trade agreements or in the execution of those trade agreements to allow things that might not have been as fair to continue. I presume that they did it because they thought net-net it was still better than not having the trade at all. And, in fact, I have looked at it in depth; my instinct is many, many, many of these trade deals that are currently situated have benefitted us, right, net, even though they may not be as fair as they could be.\par \par \uc2 That said, we have a totally legitimate interest to making them as fair as they could be. And I think if they were fairer, they'd be better. So I wouldn't go back and say we'd be better off if we hadn't traded with China or Mexico. I don't intuitively believe that's correct. But do I believe we'd have better trade if it was fairer? I do.\par \par \uc2 Q: Hi. Good morning. So the question \u8211\'20\'13 a lot of technologists and futurists are predicting that robotics and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , automation \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). Are you guys having a conversation around this topic? And, if so, what are your thoughts on how it may affect the economy?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: I've seen a lot of the same studies you are and, you know, I'll say that there's a lot of studies. I'm reminded of the \u8211\'20\'13 Time magazine had a study in the early '60s where they looked at the effect of automation and they decided if we could just get all the automation implemented, we would all just work a three-hour day. (Laughter.) And that's actually what they thought, and then the picture was the robot butler that would scoot over and give you your drink at the end your three-hour day. (Laughter.) And so technology is going to come. Technology will replace some jobs. It will \u8211\'20\'13 you know, industries are constantly being disrupted by technology.\par \par \uc2 A little bit the question is, will that happen \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible)? And there's a piece to it which is positive for the economy, that I think a lot of businesses \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 more effective. It will create new jobs. Like AI \u8211\'20\'13 \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  translators is a job that's going to be quite a big job in the future that actually doesn't exist today. But the key to making it really work in the long term is for our workforce to be capable enough that they can redeploy in the way that economic theory suggests they do.\par \par \uc2 And that's why I think workforce development is such a big thing. And if you read books, James Hills's great book I would recommend, and it talks about some of the challenges that workforces have in redeployment. You definitely get the feeling that technology will come in and displace workers, but if we don't have any thought to how those workers redeploy to other tasks, that that's our real issue as an economy.\par \par \uc2 And as I said before, probably right now we have jobs for everyone who's looking for jobs. We need to get some of the folks who aren't looking for jobs to be, you know, back in the workforce looking for employment \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). And so I think we do have an opportunity to be investing in the development of that workforce to be able to do that.\par \par \uc2 Q: To follow on just a little bit on that, lately world-wide, particularly in emerging economies, there's an increasing awareness of the value added for investing in (research and development), including fundamental or what's called basic research, whether it be in biomedical, engineering, communications, whatever it might be. It seems like in the last decade we've lost a bit of will, and perhaps policy can help guide us back to that.\par \par \uc2 I suppose there are two choices, and I wonder what your opinion is. One choice is we become a country that takes advantage of fundamental discoveries made elsewhere in the world and translate and apply. The other is that we double down on the history of the United States to be a world leader in fundamental discovery. Can policy from where you sit affect that decision? And what is your opinion about which way we should go?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: The way you described the second one sounded a lot better than when you described the first one. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 I'll probably give a non-answer to the question, but, you know, policy-wise \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 how just, you know, or where the government spends money on whatever. I do have a feeling that the right spending on infrastructure for this country is an important thing. And infrastructure has many different components to it.\par \par \uc2 You, obviously, think about roads and rail lines and those things as physical infrastructure, but I think that basic research is part of the fundamental infrastructure base of this country. And I do think that investment in basic research by this country has paid off in the past and would continue to do that going forward.\par \par \uc2 I'm also more than comfortable with us taking advantage of other people's innovations and innovating on top of those ourselves. So I don't \u8211\'20\'13 I don't see it as much as a choice between the two; I see it as a both/and.\par \par \uc2 Q: (In progress following break) ... The Fed is a regulator, and in the recent past it seems that one size fits all has been more prominent. What can the Fed do to encourage the growth and the success of local small banks?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Well, there are a couple of things in there. But I think \u8211\'20\'13 I think the core of what you're asking is, do we think that one size fits all makes sense for our oversight and support of banks? And I think you'll see in some of the regulatory stuff that has passed recently and in the support that we've given to that regulatory stuff that I, and I think others, are supportive of tailoring.\par \par \uc2 The way I think about it is I was an ex-consultant, so they should be getting the same protection of the economy with less administration, less ask. That's a very attractive thought to me. And so I think it's a very attractive thought to say, horses for horses, we should be tailoring recommendation to what the actual risk is and what the actual need is. And I think you see that coming out of the most recent Senate bill. We're in the process of, you know, tailoring our reviews by size of institution and by risk of institution to make sure we give the most in-depth reviews to the ones that have the most risk.\par \par \uc2 I'd just say as an aside that, to me, there's actually a lot of interesting stuff in entrepreneurial finance. A lot of it's online and, you know, what's happening in some of those fintech firms, they're getting to that as well. And I do think for the smaller banks, you know, how they compete with the online thing is another \u8211\'20\'13 a big issue. And I've noticed the (\uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 ) has just reached out to start regulating some of the online banks. I think that will be a good thing as well.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: I think that's \u8211\'20\'13 from a banker's standpoint, that feels like they have a playing field, that they come in without regulation and yet we're regulated.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Well, again, we're always trying \u8211\'20\'13 you asked about what keeps me up at night. We're always trying to think about what the next problem is, not the last problem. I actually do have a philosophical \u8211\'20\'13 or view that we never make the same mistake twice. But what is the next problem? And so parts of the system that are underregulated or unregulated, I think that those are places to look at.\par \par \uc2 Q: Talk to us a little bit about cryptocurrencies, and how you see it impacting our economy and on the future.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: We'll see. (Laughter.) I have to report my investments every year, so I want to make clear that I am not invested in any cryptocurrencies. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 So the whole \u8211\'20\'13 the blockchain methodology, which is behind cryptocurrency, is a really interesting methodology providing verification and security. And most of the folks that I have talked to believe that's a real innovation and has real value.\par \par \uc2 The question of whether that is best used as a currency is an interesting one, and I think what I would think about it is this. Obviously, if you got some currency and someone else will pay you for it, then it's currency. But if you value currency as \u8211\'20\'13 if you value the stability features of currency \u8211\'20\'13 you know, money has a stable source of value \u8211\'20\'13 then it's hard for me to imagine how you would be using as currency something that isn't backed by the government, but is instead backed by a bunch of people who, by definition, you don't know. It just doesn't make that much sense to me. And so I think it's a fun investment, but I don't know that it's yet got the level of protection that you would hope for in currency.\par \par \uc2 Q: You've done some talking about sort of the next problem and other economic disruptions. Can you talk a little bit about environmental factors? For example, sea-level rise. Many of the primary economic cities that you represent \u8211\'20\'13 Richmond, Baltimore, Norfolk, Hampton Roads \u8211\'20\'13 they're all affected by sea-level rise. And I just wondered what part, if any, that it played in environmental resiliency.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: I am a homeowner on the beach in South Carolina, so I'm aligned with your concerns. Also, offshore drilling.\par \par \uc2 Actually, the \uc2 Richmond Fed\uc2  just published a paper \u8211\'20\'13 I think I saw it; it was yesterday or the day before \u8211\'20\'13 on climate change and some of the impact on the economy. And I think I'm being direct, though; our sense of the economy is more a two- or three- or four-year kind of look, and I think a lot of these climate-change issues are much longer-term kind of issues. And so it's not obvious to me that the rising of the \u8211\'20\'13 potential rising of the seas is something we can take into account in next month's interest-rate decision. And so I just think that is what it is.\par \par \uc2 There are some interesting analyses that have been done and are being done. And I would point to this thing Richmond \u8211\'20\'13 and talk about, you know, what the economic impact could be of higher temperatures, higher \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 you know, those sort of things.\par \par \uc2 And, of course, there are puts and takes. You create a \u8211\'20\'13 it's hotter for you, but it's, you know, nicer for somebody in Canada is sort of puts and takes. But I wouldn't say we do a ton on that.\par \par \uc2 It is one of the interesting things about being in the Federal Reserve is, you know, our lane is pretty focused. The Congress has given us the task of setting interest rates, maximum employment, stable prices, and that's where we focus. There's actually a huge economy out there that we don't control. Things like fiscal policy, policy makers have a lot more influence over that than we do. We have the chance to comment on it, but we really don't control it.\par \par \uc2 Q: Health care is a significant, growing part of the (gross domestic product) in this country. And I've heard some economists say it's unsustainable more than worrisome, crowding out other economies. Other economists are saying thank goodness for health care and we obviously \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 more and more. Where do you come down on that?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: I don't think I have an opinion on whether health care should be a bigger sector of the economy or a smaller sector of the economy. I have heard lots of stuff; I've talked to lots of people ... And the economists I speak to, you know, do find the funding system of the health-care model to be sort of counter \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 economic theory with cross-subsidies, as you know, from government-funded to, you know, charity cases, people who \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 insurance. So there's a lot of belief in the \u8211\'20\'13 in the profession that if we could, you know, find a way to clean up the payment models and make it a more efficient payment model, that might have benefits for everyone ...\par \par \uc2 But I don't think we have an intuitive \u8211\'20\'13 I don't believe this is a managed economy. I don't believe we'll ever wake up and say health care ought to be bigger and something else ought to be smaller. I'd like to see the markets work.\par \par \uc2 Q: What is the \u8211\'20\'13 your influence and difference in influence between a credit union and a bank?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Well, I mean, credit unions are regulated by different operating machinery than banks are. You probably know that. They have a different tax regime. And so, you know, our \u8211\'20\'13 we are regulating banks that we regulate; we're not talking about their oversight.\par \par \uc2 I'm not sure what you're \u8211\'20\'13 is that what you're getting at?\par \par \uc2 Q: Well, basically, the difference in the operations of the \u8211\'20\'13 of the two, if you \u8211\'20\'13 if you influence at all credit unions.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: I don't think we do, meaningfully. I mean, I think they're \u8211\'20\'13 they're regulated in their lane, but we're not in their oversight.\par \par \uc2 Banking regulation is very complicated, a whole \u8216\'20\'18nother conversation, but there are multiple regulators in the banking space. We regulate \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 banks. We regulate bank holding companies. That's what we've been chartered to regulate. And there are other regulators \u8211\'20\'13 the OCC, the (\uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 .), for example \u8211\'20\'13 that regulate other institutions. And we do our best to try to keep it all aligned. We certainly regulate the biggest banks, right? We don't regulate all the small banks. In fact, there are multiple regulators in that space.\par \par \uc2 Q: I thought it was interesting that you were responsible for overall (information technology) for the Fed. And Susan, when she asked you about what keeps you up at night, you brought up two things, and Susan also brought up catastrophic cyber problems. I was wondering, then: Do you feel that business owners big and small should be devoting more resources towards cyberrisk prevention? And, if so, where would you start, based on your knowledge of that?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: So, sadly, I do think we should be spending more resources on cyber loss prevention. And I say that knowing that those resources don't increase productivity, and I said productivity is important to growth. But sustainability is also important to growth, and I think this is one of those things that's about sustainability.\par \par \uc2 By the way, we looked at this much in my prior world as a consultant, too, and so it's something I'm relatively familiar with. And the most important thing and I think the place to start as a business is, what information do you have that, if released to other people, would be damaging to your business or more broadly? And so the answer will differ by businesses. There are businesses that really don't have very much that matters. Obviously, a lot of retailers have credit-card numbers. You may have sensitive personal information for some of your employees or maybe even some of your customers. But understanding really clearly what's the stuff that really matters and doesn't matter.\par \par \uc2 Then the challenge is that most people think of cyber prevention as the technology. And there's something to be said about the technology, making sure that your firewalls are secure and your patches are clear. There are firms out there \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 firms out there will do independent assessments and try to penetrate your firewalls and give you a good sense of how vulnerable you are.\par \par \uc2 The real issue you've got is human error, and human error is a massive issue. Almost all of major recent cyber things that have been in the public \u8211\'20\'13 think the stuff that happened in the last election \u8211\'20\'13 were phishing attempts that some human, who's really busy and has a hundred emails and just trying to get through the day, clicked on a link and in many cases put their password into the link, which enabled bad guys to get access to the internal systems.\par \par \uc2 And so, you know, one of great challenges \u8211\'20\'13 now, the good thing is this doesn't have to cost a lot of money. The bad thing is it requires a very fundamentally different \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 culture within an organization. So it's a cultural thing that says, actually, this is a huge competitive issue to us.\par \par \uc2 You know, I used to say in my old firm that people hired us in part because we were so trustworthy personally. They were going to trust us with their secrets and their strategies, and we had to be as trustworthy technologically as we were personally \u8211\'20\'13 which is a really hard thing for people to get their heads around because they have great ethics and great reputations, but they don't necessarily understand what it means to be trustworthy technologically. It is different than it means to be trustworthy personally. So I really do think it's an imperative for everybody.\par \par \uc2 You may have noticed \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 company last week talked about risks in the energy sector. And I think there's a lot of folks \u8211\'20\'13 a lot of bad guys out there who are targeting it, and I think it's probably the most contemporary way to steal from you. And so, you know, just like banks, you know, the armed guards, you know, you need to think about the same approach with your business.\par \par \uc2 Q: Can you speak to what the Fed is seeing in the \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible)? Certainly, it's starting to occur on the West Coast \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 years. I'm not in \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 but it appears there are some real problems with housing or a crisis. New construction prices are going up rapidly because of \u8211\'20\'13 partly because of tariffs and other issues. Can you speak to how the Fed's going to \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible)?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Now, I'm \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 in Richmond today, I'm reading prices are ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 Here's how \u8211\'20\'13 here's what I think is happening in the numbers. It may be different by market. Coming out of the last downturn, new home construction, you know, went through the floor and it's been very slow to come back. Part of that was we were overbuilt beforehand. Part of it was confidence. Part of it was access to funds, right? But it's been slow to come back. And I think today a large part of it is access to trade, laborers. You know, what I'm told is it's really hard to get construction workers these days to build new homes. And if you do, it costs a lot of money to do it.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, new home demand has started to rise, and part of that is you have more confidence in the economy. I think a large part of it is there's a whole millennial generation that, you know, the story was five years ago they were going to live in the cities and bike to work. And a lot of them are \u8211\'20\'13 they're getting older, having kids, and buying houses. And so I think home demand has gone up at the same time that home construction has been slow to come back. And, of course, what comes out of that is an increase in housing prices. That's, I think, a relatively simplistic answer to what's happening.\par \par \uc2 Whether that's a bubble and what the impacts of the bubble are is worth a conversation. I mean, one definition of a bubble is, are prices higher than the long-term rates would imply? And I do think it's market-dependent, of course, but there are many markets where that's true. In our role as regulators and also overseers of the economy, we try to ask the question of whether banks are overexposed. That's the kind of bubble we had in '07-'08. It wasn't just pricing; it was also financial market overexposure.\par \par \uc2 And we do not have any sense that that's the case right now. In fact, like I said, if there's anything we've worked hard to prevent, it's overexposure, you know, in bank balance sheets. So we may be wrong, but we're pretty comfortable with that right now.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: Any other questions?\par \par \uc2 One last question, if I may. Could you comment on the opioid crisis and also on student loans? I hear that is a \u8211\'20\'13 is that an issue? Is that a concern \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible)?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: I think both are \u8211\'20\'13 both are concerns.\par \par \uc2 On the \u8211\'20\'13 for us, we see the opioid \u8211\'20\'13 our team in Richmond has done a lot of research on it. We think hard about, you know, what it takes to get folks into the labor force. I talked about our district. Labor participation in our district is in the low 60s \u8211\'20\'13 61, 62, 63 (percent) \u8211\'20\'13 in every state in our district except for West Virginia, where it's 51 percent. So there's 10 percent fewer parts of the population who are looking for work or working. And I'm told a lot of it has to do with, you know, the opioid issue. So I'm also told by a lot of folks who are trying to hire tradesmen and truck drivers that they can't pass a drug test, and so that's another inhibitor. And so doing something to get, you know, good folks clean so that they can work I think is a huge \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 for our economy. And I'm sure it's true in multiple markets around here, too.\par \par \uc2 On student loans, student-loan debt is high, and we do watch that closely. I think the question is student-loan debt as a percentage of total consumer debt or as a percentage of the total economy is not a huge number, so we don't at this point see massive risk to the economy for student-loan debt.\par \par \uc2 I will say that we see massive risk to the individuals. You know, as I said before, 40 percent of the people who enter college aren't graduating. So there's no doubt that the outcomes if you go to college and graduate are better than the outcomes if you don't, but sadly the outcomes if you go to college and don't graduate aren't meaningfully better than the outcomes if you don't go to college at all, and \u8211\'20\'13 except that we now have no better outcomes and a lot of debt. And so we really worry about the debt more on an individual basis than we do even on a collective-economy basis. So, of course, we're paying attention to it on a collective-economy basis.\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/richmond-fed-president-says-continued-low-interest-rates-are-tough-to-justify-1533735481?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Richmond Fed President Says Continued Low Interest Rates Are Tough to Justify}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-richmond-feds-barkin-answers-reporters-questions-in-virginia-1533924288?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Transcript: Richmond Fed's Barkin Answers Reporters' Questions in Virginia}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20180810ee8a000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The size of the transaction was not disclosed.\par \par \uc2 The company's founders, including Chief Executive Tomas Liljeborg, are reinvesting alongside Nordic, the person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Macrobond was founded in 2008 in Malm\u246\'00\'F6, Sweden, and has since opened offices in London and New York. It runs a platform that lets users access a database of macroeconomic and financial information, analyze data and build charts. Its clients range from banks and institutional investors to universities.\par \par \uc2 "The demand of financial \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis and visualization is increasing continuously and Macrobond's management team has an outstanding proven track record in financial software \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," said Nordic Capital Partner Fredrik N\u228\'00\'E4slun.\par \par \uc2 Macrobond fits with two popular themes among private-equity firms. As a software-as-a-service platform, it offers the prospect of stable revenue and loyal customers. Its core offering, financial data, is also in demand among private-equity investors.\par \par \uc2 In one of the largest-ever private-equity deals, a group led by \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2  agreed in January to buy a majority stake in \uc2 Thomson Reuters Corp\uc2 .'s data and terminal business for $17 billion.\par \par \uc2 Smaller data deals this year included Citic Capital Partners' purchase of \uc2 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC\uc2 's market intelligence arm for $180.5 million and \uc2 Phoenix Equity Partners\uc2 ' \u163\'00\'A395 million purchase of economic forecaster \uc2 Capital Economics Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nordic Capital\uc2  has a long history of backing fintech companies. Last year it scored a notable success with the \u8364\'20\'AC1.5 billion sale of payments company Bambora AB to French rival \uc2 Ingenico Group\uc2 . The exit delivered a five-times return on Nordic's investment, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.\par \par \uc2 The value of private equity-backed European fintech deals is already close to $10 billion this year, compared with $5.2 billion in 2017, according to data provider \uc2 PitchBook Data Inc\uc2 .

This year's contributors include limited partners and general partners, both from long-established firms and newer ones. Although their individual preferences vary, their contributions reflect a shared intellectual curiosity and love of reading.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Ailman\uc2 , chief investment officer, \uc2 California State Teachers' Retirement System\par \par \uc2 "The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing" by Benjamin Graham\par \par \uc2 "As a primer for the beginning investor, it's an oldie, but a goodie."\par \par \uc2 "Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics" by Richard H. Thaler\par \par \uc2 "A fun read for economics nerds like me."\par \par \uc2 Beth Ferreira, managing director, FirstMark Capital\par \par \uc2 "3 Kings: Diddy, Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, and Hip-Hop's Multibillion-Dollar Rise" by Zack O'Malley Greenburg\par \par \uc2 "I'm reading this book because I am fascinated by opportunities in cultural movements. In this case, what created the opportunity to develop large lasting lifestyle brands like Beats by Dre or Diddy's C\u238\'00\'EEroc vodka."\par \par \uc2 Britt Harris, chief executive, University of Texas Investment Management Co.\par \par \uc2 "Predicting the Markets: A Professional Autobiography" by Edward Yardeni\par \par \uc2 "Traversing the financial markets is a dangerous and often treacherous undertaking. It can also be rewarding. We need a guide who has traveled the terrain over many years and under all kinds of unusual conditions. Ed Yardeni is that guide for America, and this book lays out a vast array of information that will be helpful for every investor who hopes to make their journey a success."\par \par \uc2 Pam Hendrickson, chief operating officer and vice chairman, Riverside Co.\par \par \uc2 "Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption" by Bryan Stevenson\par \par \uc2 "It's a memoir by a world class lawyer who defends people on death row! We are all implicated when we allow others to be mistreated. A story about the importance of mercy and compassion."\par \par \uc2 Julia Kahr, senior managing director, Blackstone Group LP\par \par \uc2 "Pachinko" by Min Jin Lee\par \par \uc2 "I read modern fiction as a way to relax and decompress. \u8216\'20\'18Pachinko' captured my imagination not only because it is a lovely family saga crossing multiple generations in Japan and Korea, but also because the theme of insularity between these two countries is relevant to much of the geopolitical discourse today."\par \par \uc2 Andrew Kuper, chief executive, LeapFrog Investments\par \par \uc2 "Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World" by Jack Weatherford\par \par \uc2 "This revisionist history tackles many Western myths about the history of societies and governance in the East. Genghis and his successors, far from overseeing brutal hordes, were enlightened innovators in both economics and governance. Some of the book's arguments are overblown or inaccurate, but overall it leads us to rethink the foundations of the modern world, especially Asia and other emerging markets, in which we invest."\par \par \uc2 Kyle Lefkoff\uc2 , general partner, \uc2 Boulder Ventures\par \par \uc2 "How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence" by Michael Pollan\par \par \uc2 "The medical history of psychedelic drugs and their resurgence as a treatment for depression and addiction. I've loved Pollan's books about food in the past, which combine his first-person accounts with solid history and context. This one was great, too, and should spark an important public discussion around the proper use of LSD and psilocybin in the modern practice of psychiatry."\par \par \uc2 Adam Levin, partner, Bain Capital Ventures\par \par \uc2 "The Old Man and the Sea" by Ernest Hemingway\par \par \uc2 "I am heading to Cuba over Labor Day weekend so decided to start rereading \u8216\'20\'18The Old Man and the Sea.' The last time I read it, I was in seventh grade. I always try to read a work of fiction set in my future travel destination before a trip. Hemingway illustrates the essence of the country through this sense of magical realism, as he details an elderly Cuban fisherman\u8230\'20\'26out at sea looking for a giant marlin. The language is simple, yet the story hits on the complex themes of triumph and loss."\par \par \uc2 Roger McNamee, co-founder, Elevation Partners\par \par \uc2 "Antisocial Media: How \uc2 Facebook\uc2  Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy" by Siva Vaidhyanathan\par \par \uc2 "The country has entrusted the integrity of the 2018 midterm elections to \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , along with \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2 . Is that a good idea or total insanity? Professor Siva Vaidhyanathan of the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2  has studied the issue and shares his perspective in a brilliant book."\par \par \uc2 Mike Miles, advisory director, Berkshire Partners\par \par \uc2 "The Bitter Woods: The Battle of the Bulge" by John S.D. Eisenhower\par \par \uc2 "Although it gets pretty deep into the detail of troop units and positions, it gives a very readable and credible (the author was Ike's son) account of one of the most important battles Americans have ever fought. It also covers how pride and what seem like petty jealousies almost sidetracked the British-American alliance. If those issues can impact great leaders like Eisenhower, Bradley and Montgomery in the midst of the most important enterprise of the 20th century, it should not surprise us that they crop up in other organizations all the time."\par \par \uc2 Tricia Patrick\uc2 , managing director, Advent International\par \par \uc2 "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari, "Why We Can't Wait" by Martin Luther King Jr. and "The Banker's Wife" by Cristina Alger ("Who was in my Goldman Sachs analyst class and is now a highly published author")\par \par \uc2 "Nonfiction is wonderful for keeping the mind enriched, but getting lost in great fiction is almost meditative."\par \par \uc2 Jackie Rantanen, managing director, \uc2 Hamilton Lane\par \par \uc2 "The Ambition Decisions: What Women Know About Work, Family, and the Path to Building a Life" by Hana Schank and Elizabeth Wallace\par \par \uc2 "I'm intrigued by this profile of a group of female classmates 20 years after they graduated from Northwestern, and the diversity of life and career choices they've made along the way. It speaks to the evolving definitions of success for women."\par \par \uc2 Gary Sernovitz, managing director, Lime Rock Partners\par \par \uc2 "Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup" by John Carreyrou\par \par \uc2 "When reading \u8216\'20\'18Bad Blood,' the story of the Theranos blood-testing startup fraud by The Wall Street Journal investigate reporter who unmasked it, I alternated between two conclusions. One was that the fraud, which resulted in a $9 billion valuation at its peak, was so wild, odd, brazen, and sociopathic that there is nothing of practical use to professional investors. The second conclusion, though, was that Theranos is a case study in why we need professional, industry-specialist investors\u8212\'20\'14to separate optimism from hype and to not allocate capital to bad ideas and bad people. But whether \u8216\'20\'18Bad Blood' is practical or not, the book should qualify for your summer reading list for the most basic reason: It is a fun, fast, detailed, alive and surprising read that's hard to put down."\par \par \uc2 Dave Tamburri, managing partner, Health Enterprise Partners\par \par \uc2 "Hit Makers: How to Succeed in an Age of Distraction" by Derek Thompson\par \par \uc2 "The way we shape our message to the market about a product or service is based on science and art. In \u8216\'20\'18Hit Makers,' Thompson uses a variety of examples to highlight the \u8216\'20\'18customer paradox'\u8212\'20\'14consumers innately want something both partly new as well as somewhat familiar."\par \par \uc2 Brendan Wallace, managing partner, Fifth Wall Ventures\par \par \uc2 "Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial Intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 " by Max Tegmark\par \par \uc2 "A remarkably accessible book that delves into the complex social, economic and ethical implications of superhuman AI. Most of us are familiar with Hollywood-esque, dystopian depictions of AI as \u8216\'20\'18Terminator' robots indiscriminately killing humans. However, to Tegmark, evil robots are a theatrical distraction from the real risk: a general intelligence that exceeds our own. Life 3.0's focus is on the nature of intelligence itself and why general intelligence, and perhaps even consciousness, need not be confined to the neurons and tissue of the human brain."\par \par \uc2 This column appeared in the August 2018 issue of Private Equity Analyst, a monthly magazine published by WSJ Pro.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20180810ee8a00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Claims inflation could reverse that trend, however.\par \par \uc2 Overall, net profits grew 25 per cent to \u163\'00\'A372.9m, partly because of a VAT recovery.\par \par \uc2 Mr van der Meer said: \u8220\'20\'1C\u8221\'20\'1DWe remain excited about the future \u8212\'20\'14 a fast moving and increasingly digital landscape plays to our strengths. Our capabilities in agile pricing, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and anti-fraud combined with our disciplined underwriting and strong capital position means we are well positioned to continue to identify and grow in profitable parts of the market.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180808ee88001e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 A July 26 decline in Facebook Inc. shares shaved more than $119 billion from the company's value. An Aug. 7 Page One article about Facebook's discussions with banks about possibly sharing data incorrectly said that the decline was more than $120 billion.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ August 15, 2018)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . wants your financial data.\par \par \uc2 The social-media giant has asked large U.S. banks to share detailed financial information about their customers, including card transactions and checking-account balances, as part of an effort to offer new services to users.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  increasingly wants to be a platform where people buy and sell goods and services, besides connecting with friends. The company over the past year asked \uc2 JPMorgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 U.S. Bancorp\uc2  to discuss potential offerings it could host for bank customers on Facebook Messenger, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has talked about a feature that would show its users their checking-account balances, the people said. It has also pitched fraud alerts, some of the people said.\par \par \uc2 Data privacy is a sticking point in the banks' conversations with \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , said people familiar with the matter. The talks are taking place as \uc2 Facebook\uc2  faces several investigations over its ties to political \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Cambridge Analytica, which accessed data on as many 87 million \uc2 Facebook\uc2  users without their consent.\par \par \uc2 One large U.S. bank pulled away from the talks due to privacy concerns, some of the people said.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has told banks that the additional customer information could be used to offer services that might entice users to spend more time on Messenger, a person familiar with the discussions said. The company is trying to deepen user engagement: Investors shaved more than $120 billion from its market value in one day last month after it said its growth is starting to slow.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  said it wouldn't use the bank data for ad-targeting purposes or share it with third parties.\par \par \uc2 "We don't use purchase data from banks or credit-card companies for ads," spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana said. "We also don't have special relationships, partnerships or contracts with banks or credit-card companies to use their customers' purchase data for ads."\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  shares climbed sharply Monday on the news, rising 4.45%, marking the biggest one-day gain since last month's historic drop.\par \par \uc2 Banks face pressure to build relationships with big online platforms, which reach billions of users and drive a growing share of commerce. They also are trying to reach more users digitally. Many struggle to gain traction in mobile payments.\par \par \uc2 Yet banks are hesitant to hand too much control to third-party platforms such as \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . They prefer to keep customers on their own websites and apps.\par \par \uc2 As part of the proposed deals, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  asked banks for information about where their users are shopping with their debit and credit cards outside of purchases they make using Facebook Messenger, the people said. Messenger has some 1.3 billion monthly active users, Chief Operating Officer \uc2 Sheryl Sandberg\uc2  said on the company's second-quarter earnings call last month.\par \par \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . also have asked banks to share data if they join with them, in order to provide basic banking services on applications such as Google Assistant and Alexa, according to people familiar with the conversations.\par \par \uc2 "Like many online companies, we routinely talk to financial institutions about how we can improve people's commerce experiences, like enabling better customer service," \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's Ms. Diana said. "An essential part of these efforts is keeping people's information safe and secure."\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has taken a harder public line on privacy since the Cambridge Analytica uproar. A product privacy team has announced new features such as "clear history," which would allow users to prevent the service from collecting their off-\uc2 Facebook\uc2  browsing details. It also is making efforts to alert users to its privacy settings.\par \par \uc2 That hasn't assuaged concerns over \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's privacy practices. Bank executives are worried about the breadth of information being sought, even if it means their bank might not being available on certain platforms their customers use. Bank customers would need to opt-in to the proposed \uc2 Facebook\uc2  services, the company said in a statement Monday.\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  isn't "sharing our customers' off-platform transaction data with these platforms, and have had to say no to some things as a result," spokeswoman Trish Wexler said.\par \par \uc2 Banks view mobile commerce as one of their biggest opportunities but are still running behind technology firms such as \uc2 PayPal Holdings Inc\uc2 . and Square Inc. Customers have moved slowly, too; many Americans still prefer using credit or debit cards, along with cash and checks.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to compete with \uc2 PayPal\uc2 's Venmo, a group of large banks last year connected their smartphone apps to money-transfer network Zelle. Results are mixed so far: While usage has risen, many banks still aren't on the platform.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has tried to transform Messenger into a hub for customer service and commerce, in keeping with a broader trend among mobile messaging services.\par \par \uc2 A partnership with \uc2 American Express Co\uc2 . allows \uc2 Facebook\uc2  users to contact the card company's representatives. Last year, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  struck a deal with \uc2 PayPal\uc2  that allows users of that payment service to send money through Messenger. And \uc2 Mastercard Inc\uc2 . cardholders can place online orders with certain merchants through Messenger using the card company's Masterpass digital wallet. (A Mastercard spokesman said \uc2 Facebook\uc2  doesn't see the card users' information.)\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Douglas MacMillan and Laura Stevens contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Banks Will Lose Patrons' Trust Via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 " -- WSJ Aug. 16, 2018)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180807000067"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180807ee870001u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

They use StreetLight's technology to gain detailed insights about traffic patterns to inform designs of city infrastructure projects, solve traffic problems and plan mobility services like bike sharing and even flying taxis, said Laura Schewel, StreetLight Data's founder and chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Her company just raised a $10 million Series C round in a deal funded by existing investors \uc2 Osage Venture Partners\uc2 , Engie New Ventures and Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners. It has raised a total of $27.4 million since it was founded in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Schewel said the San Francisco-based company intends to nearly double its 42-person staff in the next 18 months with the new capital. She declined to provide financial specifics but said revenue growth has doubled annually for several years and should continue "at that pace."\par \par \uc2 Veery Maxwell, a director of Energy Innovation: Policy and Technology LLC, will join the company's board in conjunction with the funding.\par \par \uc2 Write to Alexander Davis at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:alec.davis@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 alec.davis@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180807ee8700461\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Property insurers are relying on more drones, small aircraft and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to accelerate claims during 2018's hurricane season. There are signs this push for speed could pose new headaches for the industry.\par \par \uc2 Last year marked the first widespread use of aerial technology to pinpoint damages and evaluate losses quickly as insurers scrambled to keep up with back-to-back hurricanes and wildfires.\par \par \uc2 But some insurers have reopened claims from that period because initial repair estimates turned out to be too low, according to executives and regulators.\par \par \uc2 Everest Re Group Ltd\uc2 ., which offers insurance coverage to other insurers, said last week it increased its estimated 2017 net catastrophe losses by $400 million partly because many customers had to reopen claims in Florida and Puerto Rico.\par \par \uc2 "Settling claims quickly was initially a sound strategy, but what we now know is that this approach left our clients vulnerable when the actual repair bills came in higher than at what they originally closed their claim," Chief Executive \uc2 Dominic Addesso\uc2  said on a conference call last week.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are testing a number of new tools as they try to speed up what still can be a clunky, time-consuming claims process. That includes everything from drones and small airplanes to assess damage without the help of an on-site adjuster to smartphone apps that let consumers submit their own damage photos. Some insurers are identifying property damage before policyholders even reach out to report a claim.\par \par \uc2 It took 16.5 days on average in 2017 for policyholders to receive payments for residential property damage after notifying their insurers, according to a J.D. Power survey released this year. That was down from 17.4 days in 2016 but still longer than the average time earlier in the decade.\par \par \uc2 Several large insurers said they are using flights, drones and aerial imagery more frequently in 2018. \uc2 Allstate Corp\uc2 . settled 16,500 claims this way in the first half of this year, compared with 12,600 for all of 2017.\par \par \uc2 Allstate\uc2  also is expanding its use of a program called "Virtual Assist" that reduces the need for an adjuster to visit a site in person. Instead a service provider broadcasts the damage to an office-based adjuster via streaming video. In the first half of 2018, \uc2 Allstate\uc2  resolved 47,500 claims this way, up from 6,100 in all of 2017.\par \par \uc2 Virtual Assist addresses a problem that surfaced last year: a shortage of adjusters, which contributed to claims delays. The program eliminates travel time for adjusters, according to \uc2 Allstate\uc2 , allowing them to be more efficient.\par \par \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 ., another property insurer, launched a system last year with data feeds, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and forecasting models, so loss-prevention specialists can monitor wildfires and storms and their proximity to policyholders. \uc2 AIG\uc2  can then dispatch teams to clear brush or transport valuables.\par \par \uc2 "The name of the game today is preparation and mitigation as much as claim response afterward," said \uc2 Jerry Hourihan\uc2 , president of AIG's Private Client Group.\par \par \uc2 Some customers, like Stephen Dunn in Houston, are pleased with the industry's efforts to speed things up. He said a motion sensor installed on his doorbell alerted his phone to rising water levels during the 2017 arrival of Hurricane Harvey. He was able to take pictures remotely using the doorbell and send the photos to his insurer, USAA. Within two days \uc2 USAA\uc2  declared the cars in Mr. Dunn's garage a total loss and deposited money in his bank account.\par \par \uc2 "I had no idea that they would resolve this so quickly," he said.\par \par \uc2 Older policyholders have more reservations about some speed-enhancing tools, according to a 2017 study by J.D. Power. Policyholders older than 53 years who filed an auto claim via a photo app on a smartphone, tablet or computer were less satisfied than peers going the traditional route, according to J.D. Power. Younger customers, on the other hand, were more satisfied.\par \par \uc2 "Now the insurer is saying, 'You need to do the work. Be sure you photograph the damage and send us a photo,'" said David Pieffer, a J.D. Power insurance practice leader.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw553\pich211\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal8295\pichgoal3165

Michael Rogers\uc2  is making his first move in the private sector.\par \par \uc2 The former National Security Agency director has joined the board of directors of cybersecurity insurance startup CyberCube \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc. He was introduced to company leaders at a party following his retirement in the spring, CyberCube Chief Executive Pascal Millaire said.\par \par \uc2 CyberCube, which spun out of \uc2 Symantec\uc2  in March, is one of several companies seeking to model cyberrisk for the insurance industry. The company also has received venture backing from ForgePoint Capital.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rogers, who was traveling and wasn't available for an interview, is just the latest national security veteran to take on roles at startups. Former National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander serves as chief executive of IronNet. Retired Gen. Peter Pace has board seats with \uc2 AlienVault Inc\uc2 . and Qualys Inc. Former NSA Director Mike McConnell serves on the board of IronNet.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Millaire said the insurance industry and national security agencies are trying to determine how to measure cyberrisk. He said Mr. Rogers can use his military experience to help the company predict catastrophic cybersecurity attacks.\par \par \uc2 "In essence, the insurance industry is faced with very similar problems to the NSA and [the Pentagon's] Cyber Command arm," Mr. Millaire said.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180807ee870008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

This is how things get stymied.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Mr Lewis, who co-founded RateSetter in 2010 and has since overseen more than \u163\'00\'A32.6bn of consumer loans on the platform, said he would fight back by providing data to disprove the regulator\u8217\'20\'19s claim that peer-to-peer lenders are a high-risk investment.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 His frustration stems from\u160\'00\'A0the consultation paper\u160\'00\'A0published just over a week ago by the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2 , which proposed placing the same restrictions on peer-to-peer lenders that already apply to high-risk platforms, such as equity crowdfunding sites.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 This would mean that to invest in peer-to-peer loans, investors would in future have to be certified as sophisticated, be very wealthy, be advised by an authorised person, or certify they will not invest more than 10 per cent of their net assets.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Mr Lewis said this contradicted the support the government and regulators have provided for the peer-to-peer lending sector, once hailed as a way to \u8220\'20\'1Cdemocratise\u8221\'20\'1D finance by giving borrowers an alternative to banks and savers a way to earn more on their money.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Online platforms that match investors with borrowers, UK peer-to-peer lenders have grown rapidly, fuelled recently by last year\u8217\'20\'19s launch of\u160\'00\'A0 Innovative Finance Individual Savings Accounts \u160\'00\'A0\u8212\'20\'14 government-approved, tax-free accounts.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 In 2016, they increased net lending by 40 per cent, providing \u163\'00\'A31.23bn of loans to small businesses \u8212\'20\'14 equal to 15 per cent of all new SME loans by UK banks \u8212\'20\'14 and similar amounts of consumer and property loans, according to the\u160\'00\'A0Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COn the one hand they are talking about the promotion of competition \u8212\'20\'14 the UK likes to be ahead on fintech \u8212\'20\'14 and on the other hand they have come to a fork in the road and they have chosen to be risk-averse,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Lewis.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FCA\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s own impact assessment suggested\u160\'00\'A0 its proposals \u160\'00\'A0could significantly change the industry. It said a survey of 4,500 investors in peer-to-peer loans found that four out of 10 had invested more than their annual income and a fifth had invested double that amount.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe can infer from this that a significant number of them are likely to be putting more than 10 per cent of their net investible wealth into P2P lending,\u8221\'20\'1D the \uc2 FCA\uc2  said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe proposals should make investors less likely to be overexposed to such assets and limit their potential losses.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have also seen some poor business practices, particularly among some P2P platforms,\u8221\'20\'1D the \uc2 FCA\uc2  said. It cited a number of \u8220\'20\'1Cpotential and actual harms\u8221\'20\'1D for investors, including unreliable performance, disorderly failure, buying unsuitable products, poor customer treatment and setting prices too high or the quality of service too low.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Some smaller peer-to-peer lenders have collapsed under a cloud in recent years. In March, \u163\'00\'A321m of investors' money was\u160\'00\'A0 put at risk \u160\'00\'A0when Manchester-based Collateral entered administration. Three years ago, Stockholm-listed TrustBuddy\u160\'00\'A0 collapsed \u160\'00\'A0with a similar amount of investors\u8217\'20\'19 money trapped on its platform after finding some of it had gone missing.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FCA\uc2  signalled its main concern was to prepare for the next downturn. \u8220\'20\'1CSo far, losses and defaults across the P2P sector have been low,\u8221\'20\'1D it said. \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, it is important to recognise that the sector is still relatively new and has not been through a full economic cycle. When economic conditions tighten, losses on loans and investments may increase.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The regulator\u8217\'20\'19s plan could complicate the plans for an\u160\'00\'A0 initial public offering \u160\'00\'A0at Funding Circle, the UK\u8217\'20\'19s biggest peer-to-peer lender that has made \u163\'00\'A33.8bn of loans to small businesses. But a person close to Funding Circle said the \uc2 FCA\uc2  proposals would benefit the largest platforms.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Paul Smee, chair of the Peer-to-Peer Finance Association, gave a\u160\'00\'A0mixed response\u160\'00\'A0to the consultation paper, saying: \u8220\'20\'1CPeer-to-peer lending needs to make its full contribution to the growth of the UK economy and we will be working to ensure that new regulatory requirements do not get in the way.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Further fintech fascination\par \par \uc2 Data gold rush\u160\'00\'A0China represents a giant playground for data-loving\u160\'00\'A0 quantitative traders, given how much is readily available from vast, digital-savvy private companies and a state that is keen to take advantage of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s benefits and relatively nonchalant over privacy. Even China\u8217\'20\'19s tech giants are getting involved.

Overall capital raised by private-equity and venture funds in the U.S. declined by a modest 13% to $173.05 billion from $199.92 billion during the same period a year earlier, according to LP Source, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro Private Equity publisher Dow Jones & Co. Capital raised dropped across nearly all major fund categories except for venture capital, and the overall number of fund closings dropped across the board.\par \par \uc2 Corporate Finance Dips in First Half as Megafunds Sit Out\par \par \uc2 The $121.25 billion raised by U.S. corporate-finance funds in the first half is a healthy sum by historical standards, but 15% lower than the 2017 pace, and the 210 funds that held closings represented a 14% drop, according to LP Source data.\par \par \uc2 Demand for private-equity funds is holding steady but isn't increasing as it did through 2016 and 2017. The stock market was flat over the first six months of 2018, which took pressure off limited partners to increase allocations to keep up with a rising market. Distributions have relaxed somewhat, reducing the urgency to keep pushing money out the door.\par \par \uc2 There also has been a subtle but clear shift by some LPs into a more risk-averse pose, industry observers said. Wary of signs of froth in the market, investors have become more selective when committing to new managers, and some have started to favor countercyclical strategies.\par \par \uc2 "We're starting to see an increased interest on the part of investors in defensive strategies," said Kevin Naughton, who co-leads the private-funds group at Credit Suisse Asset Management.\par \par \uc2 Fundraising declined across a broad swath of corporate-finance-fund types compared with the first half of 2017. Traditional buyout funds raised $53.24 billion, or 24% less capital than the same period last year. Growth and expansion funds raised 7% less than they did during the first half of 2017, while industry-focused funds rounded up 5% less. Meanwhile, capital collected for real-assets funds dropped 38%.\par \par \uc2 The only categories of U.S. corporate-finance funds that collected more money than they did a year earlier were restructuring and distressed-debt funds, which raised 3% more, and diversified private-equity funds, which raised 95% more. The latter category represents funds that invest across a broader capital structure than just buyouts, including venture and growth investments.\par \par \uc2 The popularity of distressed and diversified funds reflects concerns that high asset prices are making it harder for straight-down-the-middle buyout vehicles to earn the exceptional returns they once generated. Leverage multiples and underwriting criteria are becoming a bigger part of the due-diligence process, and LPs want to back sponsors that can unearth value in an overpriced market. As a result, so-called deep-value strategies, which target underpriced assets, and sponsors with specific operational expertise are becoming more in demand, placement agents said.\par \par \uc2 The largest distressed or restructuring fund to close in the first half was \uc2 Strategic Value Partners\uc2 ' latest special-situations fund, which held a final closing on $2.85 billion, while the largest diversified private-equity fund to close was \uc2 General Atlantic\uc2 's General Atlantic Investment Partners 2017 LP, which closed with at least $3.29 billion.\par \par \uc2 There have been other surges of interest in distressed funds in recent years\u8212\'20\'14for instance, following the 2014 oil-price decline and after the late-2015 stock selloffs in the U.S. and China\u8212\'20\'14but managers often have struggled to access deals, as corporate defaults have remained low.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, after nearly a decade of economic expansion, many investors again feel confident that distressed funds will have their moment, if not this year then within the long-term time frame of a private-equity vehicle.\par \par \uc2 "Those that are interested in deep value and distressed are willing to sacrifice short-term performance for long-term outperformance," said Eric Zoller, founder of placement agent Sixpoint Partners.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the first half saw a lull in the fundraising cycle for the biggest managers, after \uc2 Apollo Global Management LLC\uc2 , \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 ., Silver Lake and others closed funds in the double-digit billions last year. The largest buyout fund that held a final closing in the first half of 2018 was American Securities' newest vehicle, which gathered $7 billion.\par \par \uc2 As the fundraising cycle accelerated in recent years and firms have shortened the interval between funds, re-ups with large, established firms have taken up a larger proportion of LPs' available cash. But when backing new groups, they often look for niche strategies such as ones with operational or sector specialties, or strategies that aren't correlated with broader markets, said \uc2 Peter Martenson\uc2 , a partner with placement agent \uc2 Eaton Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "If they're adding new strategies to developed programs, they're no longer going for broader generalist strategies," he said.\par \par \uc2 Along with an increase in operators raising funds, there has been a "continued resurgence" in venture and growth investing, said Mr. Martenson. For some LPs, high deal prices make quickly-expanding companies more appealing, Mr. Zoller said.\par \par \uc2 Growth-equity or expansion funds raised in the first half include \uc2 Providence Equity Partners\uc2 ' Providence Strategic Growth III LP, which gathered $1.3 billion, and a $2.4 billion vehicle Thoma Bravo closed to back midmarket software deals.\par \par \uc2 However, there is some skepticism about tech buyouts, a sector many investors view as oversaturated. That isn't likely to stop the hottest players from raising new funds\u8212\'20\'14Thoma Bravo and \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2  are both in the process of raising funds targeting more than $10 billion, for instance\u8212\'20\'14but many investors want to see more exits of recent big-money deals before committing more capital, placement agents said.\par \par \uc2 The private-debt market also strikes some LPs as oversaturated, with a number of firms having launched debt platforms in recent years. Private-debt fundraising fell 52% in the first half compared with the same period last year, and the number of closings declined by 26%. The bar for new investment in credit has risen simply because the field is so crowded with managers raising money, placement agents said.\par \par \uc2 Venture Capitalists Raise More Capital for Fewer Funds\par \par \uc2 Venture-capital firms continue to benefit from LP appetite for the latest hot startups this year as large offerings help drive fundraising totals.\par \par \uc2 During the first half, venture firms raised $26.66 billion, up about 19% from $22.33 billion in the first half of last year, driven partly by $6 billion raised for Sequoia Capital's global growth fund, according to LP Source. The overall number of funds raised declined by about 7%, however, to 297 funds during the first half from 321 offerings during the same period last year.\par \par \uc2 Fundraising accelerated in the second quarter with $17.74 billion raised, up 22% from $14.49 billion during the year-ago period. Even excluding Sequoia's fund, U.S. funds raised $11.74 billion in the quarter, which is the industry's largest quarterly haul since the second quarter of last year, when \uc2 New Enterprise Associates\uc2  closed its $3.3 billion fund.\par \par \uc2 Although industry veterans such as CRV, Meritech Capital Partners and Sequoia enjoyed fundraising success during the first half, investors also showed a willingness to bet on newer groups. At least 29 debut funds, often ones focused on very narrow strategies, have formed this year as of July 18, according to LP Source.\par \par \uc2 The increase of capital pouring into late-stage funds hasn't slowed down, thanks almost entirely to Sequoia's new fund. That fund accounted for the lion's share of the $7.46 billion raised by nine late-stage offerings during the first half.\par \par \uc2 Firms that invest across multiple venture-capital stages saw the overall number of funds that held closings increase more dramatically than capital raised. During the first half, 68 funds raised money, up 19% from 57 funds that held closings in last year's first half. Capital collected, however, only rose by 9% during those periods to $10.23 billion during the first six months of this year.\par \par \uc2 Early-stage funds collected $8.30 billion in the first half, slightly less than the $8.48 billion raised in the comparable period last year. However, the number of early-stage closings declined by 17% to 202 fund closings during the first half from 244 in the year-earlier period. Early-stage investors that raised funds this year include veteran firms 8VC, \uc2 Matrix Partners\uc2 , Emergence Capital, \uc2 Madrona Venture Group\uc2 , Redpoint Ventures and Venrock, as well as newcomer Unusual Ventures.\par \par \uc2 Despite the increasing amount of capital flowing into startups, LPs continue to seek out venture funds where they can find strong returns, said Tim Porter, a managing director at Madrona, which recently raised a $300 million early-stage fund for startups in the Pacific Northwest.\par \par \uc2 "The LP community is receptive, assuming you post strong returns," he said.\par \par \uc2 Large Secondary Firms Pause to Reload\par \par \uc2 Fundraising for secondary vehicles has cooled off after a few years of furious growth, with $9.18 billion raised by U.S. and European managers in the first half, down substantially from $17.49 billion raised during the first half of 2017. When calculating secondary fund totals, WSJ Pro Private Equity combines U.S. and European data because those managers often invest their funds globally.\par \par \uc2 The decline from last year's first half stems from the fact that few, if any, of the largest secondary firms held big closings during the first six months of this year.\par \par \uc2 The first half belonged largely to firms targeting smaller deals or specialized strategies, including HQ Capital, PineBridge Investments and \uc2 RCP Advisors\uc2 . Among the largest funds to raise capital during the first half were a $1.75 billion real-assets secondary fund from \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2 's Strategic Partners unit and a new midmarket-focused vehicle being marketed by \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2  spinout Glendower Capital. Glendower closed on $1.3 billion for the fund, putting it about halfway to a $2.5 billion hard cap.\par \par \uc2 The secondary fundraising lull comes as secondary deal making continues to move at a record pace. During the first half, alone, secondary deal volume hit $27 billion, putting it on track to exceed the record level hit in 2017, according to intermediary \uc2 Greenhill & Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the fundraising lull may be short-lived. Firms that include \uc2 Coller Capital\uc2 , Ardian and \uc2 Lexington Partners\uc2  are pitching massive new funds to investors. Lexington, for one, is expected to hold a substantial closing of its next flagship fund before year-end, said people with knowledge of the firm.\par \par \uc2 Preparing for a Second-Half Bump\par \par \uc2 Although it was a relatively quiet first half for the biggest private-equity firms, and a crowded field for the smaller players, sponsors with creative fund strategies remain in demand. As the year continues to unfold, anticipated closings from larger players such as Thoma Bravo, Vista, TCV and Lexington could substantially boost totals by year-end. Early in the third quarter, for example, \uc2 Insight Venture Partners\uc2  closed its 10th tech-focused fund at $6.3 billion.\par \par \uc2 The largest firms still dominate the fundraising market, but as their returns fall, investors are seeking out niche strategies for the kind of home-run returns that large-cap funds no longer consistently offer, said Christopher Godfrey, president of private-equity \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company Cepres GmbH.\par \par \uc2 "Investors tend to be more attracted to the brand names for security but are looking around the fringes for increased performance," he said.\par \par \uc2 This article appeared in the August 2018 issue of Private Equity Analyst, a monthly magazine published by WSJ Pro.\par \par \uc2 Write to Chris Cumming at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:chris.cumming@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 chris.cumming@wsj.com}}}\uc2 , Tomio Geron at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:tomio.geron@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tomio.geron@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Laura Kreutzer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.kreutzer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.kreutzer@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20180806ee86001e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Their Worry: More Mistakes; Aerial technology such as drones was used widely last year to evaluate damage amid back-to-back disasters\b0\par\par\uc2 By Leslie Scism and Nicole Friedman \par \uc2 916 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 August 2018\par 15:48\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Property insurers are relying on more drones, small aircraft and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to accelerate claims during 2018's hurricane season. There are signs this push for speed could pose new headaches for the industry.\par \par \uc2 Last year marked the first widespread use of aerial technology to pinpoint damages and evaluate losses quickly as insurers scrambled to keep up with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricanes-earthquakes-rack-up-huge-bill-for-insurers-1506945600"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 back-to-back hurricanes}}}\uc2  and wildfires.\par \par \uc2 But some insurers have reopened claims from that period because initial repair estimates turned out to be too low, according to executives and regulators.\par \par \uc2 Everest Re Group Ltd\uc2 ., which offers insurance coverage to other insurers, said last week it increased its estimated 2017 net catastrophe losses by $400 million partly because many customers had to reopen claims in Florida and Puerto Rico.\par \par \uc2 "Settling claims quickly was initially a sound strategy, but what we now know is that this approach left our clients vulnerable when the actual repair bills came in higher than at what they originally closed their claim," Chief Executive \uc2 Dominic Addesso\uc2  said on a conference call last week.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are testing a number of new tools as they try to speed up what still can be a clunky, time-consuming claims process. That includes everything from drones and small airplanes to assess damage without the help of an on-site adjuster to smartphone apps that let consumers submit their own damage photos. Some insurers are identifying property damage before policyholders even reach out to report a claim.\par \par \uc2 It took 16.5 days on average in 2017 for policyholders to receive payments for residential property damage after notifying their insurers, according to a J.D. Power survey released this year. That was down from 17.4 days in 2016 but still longer than the average time earlier in the decade.\par \par \uc2 Several large insurers said they are using flights, drones and aerial imagery more frequently in 2018. \uc2 Allstate Corp\uc2 . settled 16,500 claims this way in the first half of this year, compared with 12,600 for all of 2017.\par \par \uc2 Allstate\uc2  is also expanding its use of a program called "Virtual Assist" that reduces the need for an adjuster to visit a site in person. Instead a service provider will broadcast the damage to an office-based adjuster via streaming video. In the first half of 2018 \uc2 Allstate\uc2  resolved 47,500 claims this way, up from 6,100 in all of 2017.\par \par \uc2 Virtual Assist addresses a problem that surfaced last year: a shortage of adjusters, which contributed to claims delays. The program eliminates travel time for adjusters, according to \uc2 Allstate\uc2 , allowing them to be more efficient.\par \par \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 ., another property insurer, launched a system last year with data feeds, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and forecasting models, so loss-prevention specialists can monitor wildfires and storms and their proximity to policyholders. \uc2 AIG\uc2  can then dispatch teams to clear brush or transport valuables.\par \par \uc2 "The name of the game today is preparation and mitigation as much as claim response afterward," said \uc2 Jerry Hourihan\uc2 , president of AIG's Private Client Group.\par \par \uc2 Some customers, like Stephen Dunn in Houston, are pleased with the industry's efforts to speed things up. He said a motion sensor installed on his doorbell alerted his phone to rising water levels during the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-months-after-harvey-houston-continues-to-count-the-cost-1509442203"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 2017 arrival of Hurricane Harvey}}}\uc2 . He was able to take pictures remotely using the doorbell and send the photos to his insurer, USAA. Within two days \uc2 USAA\uc2  declared the cars in Mr. Dunn's garage a total loss and deposited money in his bank account.\par \par \uc2 "I had no idea that they would resolve this so quickly," he said.\par \par \uc2 Older policyholders have more reservations about some speed-enhancing tools, according to a 2017 study by J.D. Power. Policyholders older than 53 years who filed an auto claim via a photo app on a smartphone, tablet or computer were less satisfied than peers going the traditional route, according to J.D. Power. Younger customers, on the other hand, were more satisfied.\par \par \uc2 "Now the insurer is saying, 'You need to do the work. Be sure you photograph the damage and send us a photo,'" said David Pieffer, a J.D. Power insurance practice leader.\par \par \uc2 Some insurers are wary of using photo apps for home damage, citing the possibility of more complexities.\par \par \uc2 "We're cautious," said Ross Buchmueller, chief executive of PURE Group of Insurance Cos., which focuses on the affluent. "You don't want to find out you did an incomplete job and need to reopen the claim."\par \par \uc2 In Texas, for the vast majority of homeowners who filed claims following Hurricane Harvey's Aug. 25 landfall, it took an average of 24.5 days for resolution, according to state insurance-department data as of Oct. 31. In Florida, about half of complaints to an insurance hotline following Hurricane Irma involved claim delays.\par \par \uc2 In both states satisfaction with the handling of property claims fell last year, according to J.D. Power.\par \par \uc2 "We're seeing some improvements in the way that insurers are working with their customers to get the benefits paid with as little hassle as possible," said Amy Bach, executive director of consumer group United Policyholders. "But that is not all insurers and that is not in all regions."\par \par \uc2 Write to Leslie Scism at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:leslie.scism@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 leslie.scism@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Nicole Friedman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:nicole.friedman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 nicole.friedman@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180806ee8600231\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Investors are piling into bets against China's stocks and currency, reviving what has been one of Wall Street's most popular -- and painful -- trades in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Asset managers including \uc2 Invesco Ltd\uc2 . have amassed positions that will pay off if the Chinese yuan continues to slide, while investment firms such as Muddy Waters Research and Blue Orca Capital LLC have announced new bets against Chinese stocks.\par \par \uc2 Rising interest in shorting, or betting against, Chinese markets comes amid an intensifying trade spat with the U.S. that investors fear will exacerbate the country's economic slowdown.\par \par \uc2 "If you get the next round of tariffs, it's going to deliver a larger economic shock than what you witnessed in Asia in 2015 and 2016," said James Ong, a senior macro strategist at Invesco who is betting against the Chinese currency. "It might challenge their control of the currency to a greater degree."\par \par \uc2 On Friday, China said it would impose levies on $60 billion of U.S. goods if Washington moves forward with plans to more than double its tariffs on Chinese imports.\par \par \uc2 Trade fears already have rocked Chinese markets in recent months. The yuan has tumbled around 5% against the U.S. dollar this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index is down 17%. Investors have made roughly $7.1 billion betting against Chinese and Hong Kong companies, according to \uc2 Ihor Dusaniwsky\uc2 , head of predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at S3 Partners.\par \par \uc2 U.S. investors have long sought to profit by shorting Chinese markets. Carson Block, founder of San Francisco-based Muddy Waters, rose to fame in 2011 after he revealed fraudulent practices at Chinese forestry company \uc2 Sino-Forest Corp\uc2 . The company filed for bankruptcy the following year.\par \par \uc2 His latest target is \uc2 TAL Education Group\uc2 , an after-school tutoring firm in China he claims is "a real business with fake financials." Its U.S.-listed shares had risen over 50% this year through June 12 before he unveiled his bearish thesis on the company. Since then, the stock has dropped around 30%. A TAL spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Soren Aandahl\uc2 , who runs Texas activist investment fund Blue Orca Capital LLC, last Tuesday unveiled his latest short bet: \uc2 GDS Holdings Ltd\uc2 ., a provider of data-center infrastructure and services in China.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Aandahl criticized the company's "staggering debt burden" and raised concerns about the company's ability to repay dollar-denominated debts amid the yuan's slide. GDS's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 37% the day the report was published. The company said in a statement that Blue Orca's claims are "false" and "reflect a fundamental misunderstanding" of its business.\par \par \uc2 Other investors are betting on broader declines in China's markets. Short sellers have added roughly $300 million in bets against the \uc2 iShares China Large-Cap ETF\uc2  this year, according to S3 Partners.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180806000041"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180806ee860000y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The development is forcing a traditionally secretive industry into an unusual position: having to promote itself, and become cool.\par \par \uc2 The office revamp is all part of that plan, as hedge funds vie with technology companies for recruits who have expertise in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , many of whom are garnering salaries of $150,000 or more straight out of university.\par \par \uc2 "A lot have gone down the \uc2 Google\uc2  route to offer more perks," said Mr Roussanov, who works for the recruitment firm \uc2 Selby Jennings\uc2  in New York.\par \par \uc2 "They're trying to rebrand themselves as tech firms."\par \par \uc2 He added: "They're telling recruits, 'we're tackling challenging problems with data'.\par \par \uc2 "They're emphasising more of the problems they are facing that need to be solved, rather than what they're trying to achieve."\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds have always been the outliers in the finance industry, more dressed-down than investment bankers, and content to have offices in Connecticut over Manhattan, but they have also rarely been in a position where they had to seek out talent. They paid the best, and traders clamoured to work for them.\par \par \uc2 But tech firms can now often offer just as much, and recent graduates who are in demand are seeking work they feel has purpose.\par \par \uc2 At the \uc2 London Business School\uc2 , the percentage of graduates going to work in tech has jumped from 6 per cent to 20 per cent over the past decade, and those entering finance fell from 46 per cent in 2007 to 26 per cent last year.\par \par \uc2 While quantitative investing funds, which trade using computer algorithms, have been on the forefront of hiring these types of candidates, other hedge funds that rely on humans to make trad-ing decisions are increasingly upping their quantitative capabilities in order to analyse reams of data faster.\par \par \uc2 Besides the increasing amount of perks funds try to offer, like revamping their workplace and offering services such as free dry-cleaning, they are emphasising the amount of money they are willing to spend on technology and the complexity of the problems in financial markets to entice recruits.\par \par \uc2 "The pitch is ... this is a very datarich environment, and it's a phenomenally well-resourced environment," said Matthew Granade, chief market intelligence officer at the Point72 hedge fund. For the people Mr Granade calls "data learning, quant types", the harder the problem, the better. "The benefit for us is that the markets are one of the hardest problems in the world. You think you've found a solution and then everyone else catches up. The markets are always adapting. So you are being presented with new challenges, and the problem is constantly getting harder."\par \par \uc2 Some hedge fund managers privately scoff at the idea that working at a tech firm is more worthy.\par \par \uc2 One executive who asked not to be named dismissed the notion that "there's a great holy mission in being at \uc2 Google\uc2  or \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Going there just means doing advertising more efficiently."\par \par \uc2 A star candidate now is likely to have six or seven offers, where it used to be two or three a few years ago, said Mr Granade.\par \par \uc2 They are usually deciding between an offer from a hedge fund, a big bank, a couple of tech firms and whether to continue at university to get their PhD, he said.\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds are starting to put together better offers than tech firms, and are streamlining the interview process to a coding test, site visit and lone interview, Mr Roussanov said.\par \par \uc2 "With hedge funds, the upside comes from the bonus," he said. "The upside is much bigger than what they could potentially make at a tech firm, where it might be a small sign-on bonus and a cash bonus at the end of the year, plus an equity component."\par \par \uc2 While money may not be the chief driver for a quant with five to 10 years' experience, right out of school it can make a difference, especially if a student has loans to repay, Mr Roussanov said.\par \par \uc2 Richard Wu, a quantitative research analyst intern at Citadel, \uc2 Ken Griffin\uc2 's $30bn hedge fund, said he hadn't considered working in finance until he was a finalist at one of Citadel's data hackathons and the firm got in contact with him.\par \par \uc2 Citadel launched what it calls its "datathons" in 2017 to help it target top quant, tech and data science graduates. Teams compete for a $25,000 cash prize, and are often approached by Citadel for internships or jobs.\par \par \uc2 "We all had the misconception that it'd be long hours, we would all have to go in at the same time, we'd all have to wear suits and that it'd be a strict dress code," Mr Wu said of his classmates at the \uc2 University of Waterloo\uc2  in Canada, where he is about to go into his senior year.\par \par \uc2 His summer internship has been eyeopening. "My team is flexible on when I come in and what I wear to work, as long as it's not a T-shirt and shorts," he said.\par \par \uc2 "As long as you get your work done, the hours are probably the same as tech. And in terms of the work we're doing, it's all technical. Both industries have their different focuses. In finance it's about increasing the bottom line. It's quantitatively more difficult and rigorous, in my opinion."\par \par \uc2 The 21-year-old, who has also done internships at \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Shopify\uc2 , said that part of the challenge for him at Citadel is "the game theory aspect; you're competing against a lot of people".\par \par \uc2 He is undecided about what he would like to do once he graduates, whether to work in finance or technology, or go to grad school, but he said his priority will be to find where he can learn the most.\par \par \uc2 "After a certain point, compensation tapers off in its importance," he said. "For me, the learning aspect outweighs the money."\par \par \uc2 When hedge funds began donating heavily to universities over the past decade to finance research on data and the financial markets, they found it came with an added bonus: closer ties with the students themselves.\par \par \uc2 That gave them a boost in recruiting some of the most in-demand graduates, the ones who are conducting research at the cutting edge of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Funds including Brevan Howard, CFM, Winton and \uc2 Man Group\uc2  have all donated to establish chairs and centres at universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and \uc2 London Business School\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One of the largest gifts has come from Brevan, Alan Howard's hedge fund, which donated \u163\'00\'A320.1m to \uc2 Imperial College\uc2  Business School to open the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis in 2014. The centre aims to fund research into preventing another financial crisis, the role of finance in achieving growth, improving the environment and developing medicine, and designing new financial structures.\par \par \uc2 While Brevan Howard is a macro hedge fund, which takes bets on macroeconomic predictions, the funds that have the closest ties to universities are predominantly quantitative, which means they trade using computer algorithms and are the most reliant on developments out of academia.\par \par \uc2 One of the largest hedge funds with a significant quant component, \uc2 Man Group\uc2 , set up the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance in 2007, and in 2016, established a centre for \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  there.\par \par \uc2 That included the appointment of two senior research fellows in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , with a focus on quantitative finance, with support from PhD students and postdoctoral research assistants.\par \par \uc2 'A lot [of hedge funds] have gone down the \uc2 Google\uc2  route to offer more perks'\par \par \uc2 'After a certain point, compensation tapers off in its importance.

In Saturday's Exchange section, a Finance article about old-money billionaires turning to venture investing incorrectly said the deal has been completed.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ Aug. 8, 2018)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 Some old-economy billionaires have a new calling: venture capitalist.\par \par \uc2 Having made their fortunes in industries that are increasingly being upended by technology, many of the world's wealthiest individuals and families are turning to venture investing as a way to bet on the future at a time when fewer startups are going public. Some are backing young companies in hopes of spotting the next potential threat to their core business. Others are lured by the promise of high returns and bragging rights when a startup makes it.\par \par \uc2 But these rookie venture capitalists aren't rushing to hang up their shingles in Silicon Valley, widely considered the beating heart of venture investing. Instead, they are setting up venture-capital firms in their hometowns, including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Chicago. They're enticing entrepreneurs with access to their networks. Since many billionaires have built businesses from scratch, they're hoping that their knowhow will be another selling point.\par \par \uc2 "These investors are saying, 'all great venture returns don't start in Silicon Valley or end there,'" said Michael Kurdziel, managing partner of Participant Capital, which advises families on private equity and venture investing.\par \par \uc2 Among the new venture capitalists are Wall Street financiers \uc2 Steven A. Cohen\uc2  and \uc2 Michael Novogratz\uc2 , who are seeding financial-technology and bitcoin companies from New York.\par \par \uc2 Now that \uc2 Walt Disney Co\uc2 . has closed its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox Assets, \uc2 James Murdoch\uc2  is expected to leave the media company his father founded and plans to start a venture-capital fund to invest in digital and international media businesses, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The family of French billionaire \uc2 Francois Pinault\uc2  set up a venture firm with an outpost in Los Angeles to invest in emerging luxury and other companies.\par \par \uc2 The ultrawealthy were among the first venture capitalists. \uc2 Bessemer Venture Partners\uc2 , one of the oldest U.S. venture firms, grew out of steel baron Henry Phipps' family holding company more than a century ago. Venrock, an early investor in Apple, started in 1969 to invest on behalf of the Rockefeller family.\par \par \uc2 More recently, venture investing has been driven by hundreds of professionally managed firms, most of them in Silicon Valley. These firms raise money from pension funds and other big investors. The success of top funds and rising valuations of hot startups has made venture attractive to many types of investors.\par \par \uc2 Investors used to dream of making a wildly profitable investment in a promising company when it was selling shares in an initial public offering. But increasingly, as startups delay going public, investors are vying to back companies much earlier in their development, which has the effect of delaying IPOs even more.\par \par \uc2 In 1986, \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . went public at $21 a share, raising about $60 million. Today, the value of a \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  share purchased at the IPO has risen more than 147,000%, including stock splits. By comparison, modern-day venture-backed companies including \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Airbnb Inc\uc2 . have raised tens of millions of dollars and are valued at tens of billions without selling a single share in public markets.\par \par \uc2 "To get the . . . really, really explosive growth from technology, you have to participate in private markets now," said Garry Tan, cofounder of early-stage venture firm Initialized Capital, which counts wealthy families among its clients.\par \par \uc2 Family offices, private firms through which billionaires often invest, stand out partly because of the large amount of capital they have available. According to research by Campden Ltd., family offices have more than $4 trillion in investable assets globally.\par \par \uc2 There is little data on how much money family offices invest in venture capital, either directly or through outside venture funds, making it difficult to assess their success. Family investors are among the backers of at least 25 unicorns, or those startups valued at $1 billion or more, according to a Wall Street Journal tally.\par \par \uc2 The family office of hedge-fund titan \uc2 William Ackman\uc2  has invested in Rubicon Global, an Atlanta-based trash-collection startup last valued at $1 billion. Payments processor Adyen and grocery-delivery company \uc2 Instacart\uc2  were among companies that received late-stage funding from family offices, according to the \uc2 National Venture Capital Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 E-cigarette maker \uc2 Juul Labs Inc\uc2 ., which in July raised $650 million from investors at a $15 billion valuation, counts a family office founded by \uc2 Nicholas Pritzker\uc2  and his four adult children among its early backers. Mr. Pritzker, a San Francisco investor whose family wealth includes that from the \uc2 Hyatt Hotels Corp\uc2 . empire, is also a director of Juul, according to a recent company filing.\par \par \uc2 Family offices are typically not lead investors in venture-backed companies, although they sometimes can get in early. Mr. Pritzker's \uc2 Tao Capital Partners\uc2  was among the early backers of \uc2 Tesla Inc\uc2 ., investing in 2006. Mr. Pritzker and his sons Joby and Isaac met Tesla and \uc2 PayPal Inc\uc2 . cofounder \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  through venture capitalist Antonio Gracias, an early \uc2 PayPal\uc2  backer and family friend.\par \par \uc2 The Tesla deal, Tao's first, helped draw the Pritzker brothers into venture investing full time and helped open the door to other sought-after startups. "It becomes part of how you introduce yourself to new entrepreneurs, the list of companies you've been involved with before," said Isaac Pritzker.\par \par \uc2 Still, many guardians of family capital say they won't invest in early-stage startups because so many of them fail. "You're working with young companies to shape them and their business, and it's certainly not our skill set," said Steven Rattner, chief executive of Willett Advisors LLC, former New York City mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 's firm. It would be a rare family office that has those skills, he said. Willett instead invests directly in late-stage startups and in select venture funds.\par \par \uc2 Since 2014, \uc2 AOL Inc\uc2 . cofounder \uc2 Steve Case\uc2  has been traversing the country on a mission called "Rise of the Rest" to spur entrepreneurship in cities like Baltimore, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. Mr. Case's D.C.-based firm disclosed in 2017 it raised a $150 million seed fund from wealthy families and individuals, including \uc2 Henry Kravis\uc2  of private-equity firm \uc2 KKR\uc2  and recently departed Starbucks Corp. Chairman \uc2 Howard Schultz\uc2 . It has invested in more than 80 startups outside geographies traditional venture capitalists dominate.\par \par \uc2 "Successful tech companies are popping up all around [families]," making it impossible not to consider investing, said Jacob Cohen, who oversees venture investments for \uc2 Dan Gilbert\uc2 , the billionaire cofounder of mortgage lender \uc2 Quicken Loans Inc\uc2 . and owner of the \uc2 Cleveland Cavaliers\uc2  basketball team.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Cohen is open to investing in deals led by Valley firms, he also focuses on Michigan-area investments and holds out his serial-entrepreneur boss Mr. Gilbert as a resource to young founders.\par \par \uc2 Steve Cohen\uc2 , the hedge-fund titan who was barred from managing outside money for a time after his previous company, \uc2 SAC Capital Advisors LP\uc2 , pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013, has made venture investments with his personal money for years, including in data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 Palantir Technologies Inc\uc2 ., among the world's most valuable private companies. He has stepped up his presence in venture capital more recently, creating a business separate from his $12 billion hedge-fund firm dedicated to investing in early-stage fintech and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  startups.\par \par \uc2 "If you're only looking at the public markets, you can't understand the full economy," said Matthew Granade, who runs Mr. Cohen's Point72 Ventures, citing the work of companies including \uc2 General Motors Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Google\uc2  and Uber on autonomous cars. So far, the business has invested in three dozen startups and plans to expand its areas of interest.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cohen hasn't bypassed Silicon Valley completely. While his fintech venture team is based in New York, the \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  team is based in Palo Alto. Mr. Cohen is also a regular presence at CEO roundtables convened by Valley venture firms and \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 's popular Demo Day, where entrepreneurs who are part of the tech incubator pitch to investors.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180804000057"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180804ee840001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Investors are piling into bets against China's stocks and currency, reviving what has been one of Wall Street's most popular\u8212\'20\'14and painful\u8212\'20\'14trades in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Asset managers including \uc2 Invesco Ltd\uc2 . have amassed positions that will pay off if the Chinese yuan continues to slide, while investment firms like Muddy Waters Research and Blue Orca Capital LLC have announced new bets against Chinese stocks.\par \par \uc2 Rising interest in shorting, or betting against, Chinese markets comes amid an intensifying trade spat with the U.S. that investors fear will exacerbate the country's economic slowdown.\par \par \uc2 "If you get the next round of tariffs, it's going to deliver a larger economic shock than what you witnessed in Asia in 2015 and 2016," said James Ong, a senior macro strategist at Invesco who is betting against the Chinese currency. "It might challenge their control of the currency to a greater degree."\par \par \uc2 On Friday, China said it would impose levies on $60 billion of U.S. goods if Washington moves forward with plans to more than double its tariffs on Chinese imports.\par \par \uc2 Trade fears have already rocked Chinese markets in recent months. The yuan has tumbled around 5% against the U.S. dollar this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index is down 17%. Investors have made roughly $7.1 billion betting against Chinese and Hong Kong companies, according to \uc2 Ihor Dusaniwsky\uc2 , head of predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at S3 Partners.\par \par \uc2 That comes after a dismal 2017 performance for short-selling investors, many of whom were caught off guard by last year's global market rally. The Shanghai Composite and yuan jumped 7% against the dollar, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 36%. That sent short sellers to a roughly $35 billion loss in 2017, according to S3.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Smith, founder of Denver-based asset manager Crescat Capital, was one of them. His firm's global macro hedge fund declined 23% last year, the worst return in its 12-year history, thanks to bets against Chinese stocks and the yuan.\par \par \uc2 The dismal performance led to the departure of two of the firm's largest clients and brought its assets under management down to $46 million from a peak of $94 million in 2016. This year's market reversal has helped the fund recover 14% through June.\par \par \uc2 "From everything we can see, it's happening now," said Mr. Smith. "The currency is declining; the equity markets are in a bear market. I think this is going to be one of our best years ever."\par \par \uc2 U.S. investors have long sought to profit by shorting Chinese markets. Carson Block, founder of San Francisco-based Muddy Waters and a subject of the 2017 documentary The China Hustle, rose to fame in 2011 after he revealed fraudulent practices at Chinese forestry company \uc2 Sino-Forest Corp\uc2 . The company filed for bankruptcy the following year.\par \par \uc2 His latest target is \uc2 TAL Education Group\uc2 , an after-school tutoring firm in China he claims is "a real business with fake financials" and has likened to the 2001 \uc2 Enron\uc2  accounting scandal. The company's U.S.-listed shares had risen over 50% this year through June 12 before he unveiled his bearish thesis on the company. Since then, the stock has dropped around 30%. A TAL spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Soren Aandahl\uc2 , who runs Texas activist investment fund Blue Orca Capital LLC, last Tuesday unveiled his latest short bet: \uc2 GDS Holdings Ltd\uc2 ., a provider of data-center infrastructure and services in China. Mr. Aandahl criticized the company's "staggering debt burden" and raised concerns about the company's ability to repay dollar-denominated debts amid the yuan's slide. GDS's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 37% the day the report was published. The company said in a statement that Blue Orca's claims are "false" and "reflect a fundamental misunderstanding" of its business.\par \par \uc2 Other investors are betting on broader declines in China's markets. Short sellers have added roughly $300 million in bets against the \uc2 iShares China Large-Cap ETF\uc2  this year, according to S3 Partners. They've also raised short bets on Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong that would likely be harmed by a slowdown in growth, such as property developer China Evergrande Group and cement manufacturer \uc2 Anhui Conch Cement Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer, had long avoided betting against the yuan due to the cost of shorting the currency. A few weeks ago, he began shorting the yuan in offshore markets for the first time "in recent memory."\par \par \uc2 "The real wild card is these trade tensions and how much further do they escalate," Mr. Upadhyaya said.\par \par \uc2 Many investors have struggled to turn a profit on bearish China bets in the past. That's in part because some underestimated China's ability to stabilize its economy and financial markets, analysts say. Beijing maintains tight control over the value of the yuan, liquidity in the financial system and the ease of taking money offshore\u8212\'20\'14all tools China tapped to help control the fallout of its 2015 currency devaluation.\par \par \uc2 "People have gotten China very wrong before," said Mr. Aandahl. "There's a classic quote in short selling: It's not enough to be right; you have to be right, now."\par \par \uc2 The Chinese government has also struck back at short sellers in the past, launching investigations into some investors and squeezing others out of positions by driving up the cost of borrowing in Hong Kong, where many investors short Chinese assets due to fewer restrictions.\par \par \uc2 Beijing revived efforts to deter short sellers on Friday by announcing it will impose a 20% deposit requirement for trading currency forwards, effectively making it more expensive to bet against the yuan.\par \par \uc2 China's efforts to control market reactions have driven many bearish investors out of the market and left others hesitant.\par \par \uc2 Hayman Capital's Kyle Bass scaled back his China position after the fund posted its worst-ever annual return in 2017, he told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. Mr. Bass didn't respond to requests for comment. Longtime China bear \uc2 Jim Chanos\uc2  has also scaled back his bets against China, saying in an email: "Given the eight years of underperformance of the Chinese market, we are less short China now than in the past."\par \par \uc2 Write to Chelsey Dulaney at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Steven Russolillo at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:steven.russolillo@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 steven.russolillo@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180804ee840015r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The centre aims to fund research into preventing another financial crisis, the role of finance in achieving growth, improving the environment and developing new medicine, and designing new financial structures.\par \par \uc2 While Brevan Howard is a macro hedge fund, which takes bets on macroeconomic predictions, the funds that have the closest ties to universities are predominantly quantitative, which trade using computer algorithms and are hence the most reliant on new developments out of academia.\par \par \uc2 One of the largest hedge funds with a significant quant component, \uc2 Man Group\uc2 , set up the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance in 2007, and in 2016, established a centre for \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  there. That included the appointment of two senior research fellows in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , with a focus on quantitative finance, with support from PhD students and postdoctoral research assistants.\par \par \uc2 The fund has its own commercial office, the Man Research Lab, located in the same building as the institute.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, CFM, a French quantitative firm, funds cross-discipline research at \u201\'00\'C9cole Normale Sup\u233\'00\'E9rieure, looking at where \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will succeed, in finance and more broadly. The Paris-based hedge fund also has a relationship with \uc2 Imperial College\uc2 , where it helped launch the CFM-Imperial Institute of Quantitative Finance.\par \par \uc2 The partnership has allowed them to gain greater exposure in the UK, according to the firm.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180803ee8300af1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Equities Harvesting digital information is the modern gold rush, says a new wave of algo-driven funds\par \par \uc2 When China proposed to eliminate presidential term limits in February, allowing \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  to hold on to power indefinitely, a host of local stocks with "emperor" in their name suddenly went on a tear.\par \par \uc2 While the broader market only gained 1.5 per cent on February 26, \uc2 Shenzhen Emperor Technology\uc2  surged nearly 10 per cent when trading started.\par \par \uc2 Harbin VITI \u8212\'20\'14 an electronics group that has words meaning "powerful emperor" in its name \u8212\'20\'14 jumped over 4 per cent while \uc2 Vatti Corp\uc2 , which stands for "Chinese emperor" in the local language, opened up 7.3 per cent.\par \par \uc2 These spectacular jumps were unusual but not unprecedented. The Shanghai Composite index dipped 0.7 per cent following Donald Trump's presidential election victory but Wisesoft Co jumped by as much as 6 per cent as its Chinese name, "Chuan da zhi sheng" is a homophone for "Trump's big win". \uc2 Yunnan Xiyi Industrial Co\uc2 , whose Chinese name is a homophone for "Aunt Hillary", fell as much as 10 per cent.\par \par \uc2 These bizarre movements highlight just how retail-dominated China's vast stock market is and why quantitative investors think it could become the industry's new Klondike with market gold readily available for mining.\par \par \uc2 "This is typical," said Asha Mehta, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management, a US investment group with over $100bn under management, including a fund launched in March devoted specifically to Shanghai and Shenzhen shares. "The Chinese market is rife with behavioural errors."\par \par \uc2 Quantitative investors, or "quants", typically use high-end computers and advanced algorithms to trawl through vast data sets to find signals that they can trade, such as looking at satellite images of retailer car parks for shopping activity or credit card data for real time consumption patterns.\par \par \uc2 With many of these "alternative" data sets now widely available to investors, it has become harder to make money in ferociously competitive and efficient developed markets, like the US.\par \par \uc2 But in China \u8212\'20\'14 where retail investors account for roughly 70 per cent of all trading \u8212\'20\'14 much of this information is still valuable. Indeed, China represents a giant playground for data-loving quants, given how much is readily available from vast, digital-savvy private companies and a state that is keen to take advantage of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 's benefits and relatively nonchalant over privacy.\par \par \uc2 Even China's tech giants are getting involved. In December, search company Baidu partnered with \uc2 E Fund Management\uc2 , an asset manager, to create E Fund Yibai Intelligent Quantitative Strategy fund, which uses searches, news articles, social media and "Baidu's data processing ability" to trade.\par \par \uc2 Over a fifth of attendees at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 's annual quant conferences in Hong Kong said that \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  was already making traditional information sources like corporate earnings statements and economic statistics less relevant.\par \par \uc2 Another 32 per cent said that it was "likely" to make traditional data less important in the coming years.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, "softer" data sets, such as social media that can give clues on investor sentiment, have long proved hard to exploit in developed markets but quants say that in China they can be a gold mine.\par \par \uc2 Over half of investors surveyed by \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  said sentiment and social media data looked like the most promising of all alternative data sets.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  agrees. Its quant arm, San Francisco-based Systematic Active Equities, uses its machines to read almost 1m online posts a day in China, which it says can offer valuable indicators on what the herd of retail investors are planning to do.\par \par \uc2 "Let's say a person overheard something about a company doing well, they go and search online and see whether other people are thinking about the same thing before they do the trade," said Rhui Zhao, a portfolio manager at BlackRock's SAE unit.\par \par \uc2 Aggregating all the chater is a valuable indicator of where the retail herd is heading, she added.\par \par \uc2 The local quant industry \u8212\'20\'14 which faces none of the access restrictions that foreign investors do \u8212\'20\'14 has also grown swiftly in recent years and evolved from fairly simple models to more complex, data-intensive approaches, according to Yin Luo, head of quantitative research at Wolfe Research.\par \par \uc2 Of course, these signals are still hard to find and, in the chaos of China's day trader-driven markets, they can be even harder to exploit.\par \par \uc2 Ms Mehta and Ms Zhao's new China funds are down about 9 per cent to 10 per cent this year. That is better than MSCI's China A Shares index's 17 per cent loss and comes amid a broad global quant reversal in 2018 but underscores how \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  are far from silver bullets.\par \par \uc2 "Actual application of this kind of data still carries risks and difficulties because a lot of the data isn't freely available and transparent," said Tang Tao, chief investment officer of Quant-Bridge, a Shanghai-based quant hedge fund. "It's difficult to confirm the accuracy of social media data. At the end of the day, we're risking our own treasure with these judgments, so we're pretty cautious."\par \par \uc2 'We're risking our own treasure with these judgments, so we're cautious'\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180803ee8300094\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

"This has the arms-length benefit of not being an \uc2 HSBC\uc2  tool but an industry utility tool."\par \par \uc2 The new system developed by \uc2 HSBC\uc2  has cut the time it takes to carry out checks on customers from five hours to 1.5 hours, said Ms Roth, adding that it can learn which sources of information to prioritise if there are conflicting data on a client.\par \par \uc2 "Humans never get much above 95 per cent accuracy when they are filling out forms as it is quite tedious work, but automating it gets you much closer to 100 per cent," she said.\par \par \uc2 HSBC\uc2  employs 2,000 people in its "know your customer" operations team for corporate and institutional clients, but Ms Roth said it was continuing to add more staff even since the new system launched. "People are being used for more complex checks instead," she said.\par \par \uc2 Banks have spent vast sums on tightening up their KYC systems after regulators imposed multibillion-dollar fines on lenders that failed to spot they were handling money for criminals, taxdodgers and groups subjected to sanctions. \uc2 HSBC\uc2  spends $200m-$300m a year on KYC checks for corporate and institutional clients.\par \par \uc2 "I see it as cause and effect," said Vivek Jetley, senior vice-president at EXL. "\uc2 HSBC\uc2  has probably spent more time and devoted more talent on KYC than any other bank and that reflects their determination to become best-inclass in this area."\par \par \uc2 EXL is already in talks with the Mexican subsidiary of a large global bank interested in buying the service, as well as with banks in Australia and South Africa.\par \par \uc2 Mr Jetley said banks typically paid $300 to $450 per customer for clientchecking services. Its agreement with \uc2 HSBC\uc2  will result in the bank being paid $25m if the service sells well.\par \par \uc2 Ms Roth said the new system had helped to reduce tension with customers, who had become frustrated at repeated demands for the same information and the often lengthy delays to transactions caused by compliance checks.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180803ee830008u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Walt DisneyCo. is closing in on its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that it had closed in on the acquisition. (August 5, 2018)\par \par \uc2 Some old-economy billionaires have a new calling: venture capitalist.\par \par \uc2 Having made their fortunes in industries that are increasingly being upended by technology, many of the world's wealthiest individuals and families are turning to venture investing as a way to bet on the future at a time when fewer startups are going public. Some are backing young companies in hopes of spotting the next potential threat to their core business. Others are lured by the promise of high returns and bragging rights when a startup makes it.\par \par \uc2 But these rookie venture capitalists aren't rushing to hang up their shingles in Silicon Valley, widely considered the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-venture-funds-thrive-as-more-investors-put-money-in-tech-1511260201"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 beating heart of venture investing}}}\uc2 . Instead, they are setting up venture-capital firms in their hometowns, including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Chicago. They're enticing entrepreneurs with access to their networks. Since many billionaires have built businesses from scratch, they're hoping that their knowhow will be another selling point.\par \par \uc2 "These investors are saying, 'all great venture returns don't start in Silicon Valley or end there,'" said Michael Kurdziel, managing partner of Participant Capital, which advises families on private equity and venture investing.\par \par \uc2 Among the new venture capitalists are Wall Street financiers \uc2 Steven A. Cohen\uc2  and \uc2 Michael Novogratz\uc2 , who are seeding financial-technology and bitcoin companies from New York.\par \par \uc2 Now that \uc2 Walt Disney Co\uc2 . is closing in on its $71 billion purchase of \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2  assets, \uc2 James Murdoch\uc2  is expected to leave the media company his father founded and plans to{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-murdoch-wouldnt-move-to-disney-if-fox-deal-closes-1525824120"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  start a venture-capital fund }}}\uc2 to invest in digital and international media businesses, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The family of French billionaire \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Pinault\uc2  set up a venture firm with an outpost in Los Angeles to invest in emerging luxury and other companies.\par \par \uc2 The ultrawealthy were among the first venture capitalists. \uc2 Bessemer Venture Partners\uc2 , one of the oldest U.S. venture firms, grew out of steel baron Henry Phipps' family holding company more than a century ago. Venrock, an early investor in Apple, started in 1969 to invest on behalf of the Rockefeller family.\par \par \uc2 More recently, venture investing has been driven by hundreds of professionally managed firms, most of them in Silicon Valley. These firms raise money from pension funds and other big investors. The success of top funds and rising valuations of hot startups has made venture attractive to many types of investors.\par \par \uc2 Investors used to dream of making a wildly profitable investment in a promising company when it was selling shares in an initial public offering. But increasingly, as startups delay going public, investors are vying to back companies much earlier in their development, which has the effect of delaying IPOs even more.\par \par \uc2 In 1986, \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . went public at $21 a share, raising about $60 million. Today, the value of a \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  share purchased at the IPO has risen more than 147,000%, including stock splits. By comparison, modern-day venture-backed companies including \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Airbnb Inc\uc2 . have raised tens of millions of dollars and are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-succeeds-in-tender-offer-for-large-stake-in-uber-1514483283"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 valued at tens of billions}}}\uc2  without selling a single share in public markets.\par \par \uc2 "To get the... really, really explosive growth from technology, you have to participate in private markets now," said Garry Tan, cofounder of early-stage venture firm Initialized Capital, which counts wealthy families among its clients.\par \par \uc2 Family offices, private firms through which billionaires often invest, stand out partly because of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-force-on-wall-street-family-offices-1488991396"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 large amount of capital they have available}}}\uc2 . According to research by Campden Ltd., family offices have more than $4 trillion in investable assets globally.\par \par \uc2 There is little data on how much money family offices invest in venture capital, either directly or through outside venture funds, making it difficult to assess their success. Family investors are among the backers of at least 25 unicorns, or those startups valued at $1 billion or more, according to a Wall Street Journal tally.\par \par \uc2 Vulcan Capital\uc2 , the family office of Microsoft co-founder \uc2 Paul Allen\uc2 , for instance, has invested in augmented reality company Plantation, Fla.-based Magic Leap, in which \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 . also invested recently, as well as music-streaming company \uc2 Spotify Technology\uc2 , which went public in April. The closing price of its shares the first day of trading ranked Spotify as the eighth-biggest technology IPO, just behind \uc2 Google\uc2  in 2004, according to Dealogic.\par \par \uc2 The family office of hedge-fund titan \uc2 William Ackman\uc2  has invested in Rubicon Global, an Atlanta-based trash-collection startup last valued at $1 billion. Payments processor Adyen and grocery-delivery company \uc2 Instacart\uc2  were among companies that received late-stage funding from family offices, according to the \uc2 National Venture Capital Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 E-cigarette maker \uc2 Juul Labs Inc\uc2 ., which in July raised $650 million from investors at a $15 billion valuation, counts a family office founded by \uc2 Nicholas Pritzker\uc2  and his four adult children among its early backers. Mr. Pritzker, a San Francisco investor whose family wealth includes that from the \uc2 Hyatt Hotels Corp\uc2 . empire, is also a director of Juul, according to a recent company filing.\par \par \uc2 Family offices are typically not lead investors in venture-backed companies, although they sometimes can get in early. Mr. Pritzker's \uc2 Tao Capital Partners\uc2  was among the early backers of \uc2 Tesla Inc\uc2 ., investing in 2006. Mr. Pritzker and his sons Joby and Isaac met Tesla and \uc2 PayPal Inc\uc2 . cofounder \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  through venture capitalist Antonio Gracias, an early \uc2 PayPal\uc2  backer and family friend.\par \par \uc2 The Tesla deal, Tao's first, helped draw the Pritzker brothers into venture investing full time and helped open the door to other sought-after startups. "It becomes part of how you introduce yourself to new entrepreneurs, the list of companies you've been involved with before," said Isaac Pritzker.\par \par \uc2 Still, many guardians of family capital say they won't invest in early-stage startups because so many of them fail. "You're working with young companies to shape them and their business, and it's certainly not our skill set," said Steven Rattner, chief executive of Willett Advisors LLC, former New York City mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 's firm. It would be a rare family office that has those skills, he said. Willett instead invests directly in late-stage startups and in select venture funds.\par \par \uc2 Families' growing interest in geographies outside Silicon Valley mirrors the increasing presence of venture funds outside California. Although California-based firms accounted for more than half of venture funds managed at the end of 2017, states such as Missouri, New Mexico, Nevada and Washington saw double-digit increases in venture-capital assets under management compared to 2016, according to NVCA and Pitchbook data.\par \par \uc2 Since 2014, \uc2 AOL Inc\uc2 . cofounder \uc2 Steve Case\uc2  has been traversing the country on a mission called "Rise of the Rest" to spur entrepreneurship in cities like Baltimore, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. Mr. Case's D.C.-based firm disclosed in 2017 it raised a $150 million seed fund from wealthy families and individuals, including \uc2 Henry Kravis\uc2  of private-equity firm \uc2 KKR\uc2  and recently departed Starbucks Corp. Chairman \uc2 Howard Schultz\uc2 . It has invested in more than 80 startups outside geographies traditional venture capitalists dominate.\par \par \uc2 "Successful tech companies are popping up all around [families]," making it impossible not to consider investing, said Jacob Cohen, who oversees venture investments for \uc2 Dan Gilbert\uc2 , the billionaire cofounder of mortgage lender \uc2 Quicken Loans Inc\uc2 . and owner of the \uc2 Cleveland Cavaliers\uc2  basketball team.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Cohen is open to investing in deals led by Valley firms, he also focuses on Michigan-area investments and holds out his serial-entrepreneur boss Mr. Gilbert as a resource to young founders.\par \par \uc2 Entrepreneur-turned-venture-investor Barak Pridor, who has $100 million from media mogul Haim Saban's investment firm \uc2 Saban Capital Group\uc2  to deploy on startups, too is steering clear of the Valley. He's training Saban Ventures on Israel, which he deems as friendlier than the Valley. Israel has a thriving community of entrepreneurs and has produced venture-backed companies such as Mobileye, acquired by \uc2 Intel Corp\uc2 . for $15 billion.\par \par \uc2 "Premium deal flow is limited to a few companies in the Valley, so once in a blue moon you might get a good investment opportunity" if you focus on Silicon Valley startups but aren't locally based, Mr. Pridor said. "That's not good investment practice."\par \par \uc2 Steve Cohen\uc2 , the hedge-fund titan who was barred from managing outside money for a time after his previous company, \uc2 SAC Capital Advisors LP\uc2 , pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013, has made venture investments with his personal money for years, including in data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 Palantir Technologies Inc\uc2 ., among the world's most valuable private companies. He has stepped up his presence in venture capital more recently, creating a business separate from his $12 billion hedge-fund firm dedicated to investing in early-stage fintech and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  startups.\par \par \uc2 "If you're only looking at the public markets, you can't understand the full economy," said Matthew Granade, who runs Mr. Cohen's Point72 Ventures, citing the work of companies including \uc2 General Motors Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Google\uc2  and Uber on autonomous cars. So far, the business has invested in three dozen startups and plans to expand its areas of interest.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cohen hasn't bypassed Silicon Valley completely. While his fintech venture team is based in New York, the \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  team is based in Palo Alto. Mr. Cohen is also a regular presence at CEO roundtables convened by Valley venture firms and \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 's popular Demo Day, where entrepreneurs who are part of the tech incubator pitch to investors.\par \par \uc2 Write to Anupreeta Das at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:anupreeta.das@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 anupreeta.das@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Juliet Chung at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:juliet.chung@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 juliet.chung@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180803ee83001e3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

They also allege there is a culture of bullying at the fund manager, with one complainant describing the company\u8217\'20\'19s culture as \u8220\'20\'1Ctoxic\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 As LGIM employees arrived at work on Tuesday at their City of London headquarters, conversations turned to the news of the \uc2 FCA\uc2  complaints, as reported by the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 . Staff were warned not to speak to the press, while the sales and distribution team had been put on alert to expect calls from clients. \u8220\'20\'1CThings in the office today were not good,\u8221\'20\'1D said one LGIM employee.\par \par \uc2 A senior figure in the investment industry, who advises pension funds and asset managers on investment strategy and regularly meets with the company, said the news caused shockwaves. \u8220\'20\'1CThey are a hugely respected asset management company. The people at the top of both sets of organisations [LGIM and L&G] are well respected,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a big blow for LGIM.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The complaints to the \uc2 FCA\uc2 , which were filed under whistleblowing procedures, come while the company is in a state of flux. In May, Mark Zinkula, who became chief executive of LGIM in 2011, announced plans to step down from his role in 2019.\par \par \uc2 During his time in charge, LGIM has attempted to cast aside its reputation as a British fund house that mostly manages money for its parent company and instead become an international investment group with the capabilities to compete with global asset managers such as \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  and \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Since 2011, revenue generated by its international arm jumped by 39 per cent to \u163\'00\'A3103m, the fastest growth rate of any of its divisions. In contrast, revenues from assets managed on behalf of L&G increased by just 4 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Gordon Aitken, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the company is \u8220\'20\'1Cnicely positioned\u8221\'20\'1D for growth because of its large passive business. The global passive fund management industry has grown at 4.5 times the rate of active fund management in recent years. Mr Aitken also said the overarching insurance group, particularly its annuities business, benefits from LGIM\u8217\'20\'19s investment capabilities.\par \par \uc2 Although LGIM is still most often used by pension funds and other institutional investors, its so-called retail arm \u8212\'20\'14 aimed at financial advisers and wealth managers, as well as individual investors \u8212\'20\'14 has also been growing.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIts institutional strength has been its historical focus and although it has a good retail presence, it has not fully exploited this at a brand level,\u8221\'20\'1D said Diana Mackay, a managing director at consultancy Mackay Williams, part of Broadridge \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Solutions.\par \par \uc2 But she added: \u8220\'20\'1CThe group is highly regarded, particularly for its passive funds, by those fund selectors that use them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 One former employee, who has not submitted a complaint to the \uc2 FCA\uc2 , said he believes the focus on growing rapidly in recent years has piled pressure on staff and led to bad practices, where staff are afraid to admit to mistakes.\par \par \uc2 He also claimed that employees are dissuaded from questioning internal processes or criticising systems, which he alleges are old-fashioned and often developed by individual teams.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, this means that staff are unwilling to question managers, he said. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen you are told to do something in an environment where you can ask why, you will ask why. But in this environment, it was more a case of \u8216\'20\'18yes sir\u8217\'20\'19.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The former employee added that there is a big separation between the investment team and compliance department, which are not on the same floor. \u8220\'20\'1CThis makes a difference because you don\u8217\'20\'19t even know them. In my current company, [compliance] are on the same floor and I speak to them all the time,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 LGIM declined to comment on these allegations. But it said in a statement it had recently commissioned an external review of LGIM\u8217\'20\'19s culture, which found it over all to be \u8220\'20\'1Cpositive, respectful, professional and client focused\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are proud of the business we have built, but are never complacent and as a result deal seriously with any employee issues raised,\u8221\'20\'1D it added.\par \par \uc2 According to the complaints submitted to the \uc2 FCA\uc2 , there was a failure by an internal team to report trading errors, flouting the company\u8217\'20\'19s policies. It is alleged that this involved the duration of several funds \u8212\'20\'14 the sensitivity of the investment portfolio to interest rate changes \u8212\'20\'14 being miscalculated by analysts, meaning that trades were executed incorrectly and potentially resulted in multimillion-pound losses for clients.\par \par \uc2 Provisional findings of an internal investigation earlier this year, which were seen by the FT, indicate that there were trading mistakes that were not reported up the command chain.\par \par \uc2 The company declined to comment on the allegations, but a person familiar with the matter said the company\u8217\'20\'19s internal investigation is close to winding up. The person said in one case no mistake was found to be made, while in another the client was made fully aware of the issue. One issue is still being investigated.\par \par \uc2 The findings relate to an internal whistleblowing complaint filed last December. In documents seen by the FT, the whistleblower who raised his concerns internally said he was subsequently bullied, including being left out of client meetings. He was put on leave in July, pending an investigation into his investment performance.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks ahead, many in the investment industry will be focused on how both LGIM and the \uc2 FCA\uc2  responds.\par \par \uc2 The senior figure in the investment industry said: \u8220\'20\'1CI will be watching to see how they respond both privately and more importantly publicly to this.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C[LGIM] have not just got to resolve it immediately internally and with clients, but they also need to address it with the rest of us \u8212\'20\'14 and explain what has happened and how they will make sure it never happens again.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180801ee81000ry\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SHANGHAI -- China's e-commerce giants are starting to build a new crop of smart warehouses that can keep up with the surging growth of the world's largest online retail sales market.\par \par \uc2 But that trend promises to add enormous costs to warehouse development. Modern robot and conveyor-belt systems require a multitude of upgrades not found in traditional warehouses like higher ceilings, more air conditioning, the amount of mezzanine space and other infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 GLP, China's largest owner of warehouse and distribution space, began offering tenants financing for smart upgrades and expansion two years ago, the company said. Other warehouse landlords may soon feel pressure to follow suit, market participants say.\par \par \uc2 In May, GLP created a private-equity fund to invest 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in robotics, automation and \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  sectors that could complement its logistics real-estate business. It is "not sufficient to focus just on the facility itself," says \uc2 Victor Mok\uc2 , co-president of real estate at GLP China. "Our focus is to build a logistics ecosystem which considers every aspect of the supply chain, not just warehouse space."\par \par \uc2 To be sure, smart warehouses still make up just a sliver of the Chinese market.\par \par \uc2 Both foreign and domestic investors are carefully watching the smart-warehouse trend because the logistics property market is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the Chinese commercial real-estate industry. Last year, investors acquired $4.4 billion worth of warehouses and distribution centers, up from $3.2 billion in 2016, according to data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 China isn't as far along as U.S. and European markets in shifting to smart warehouses because labor costs are cheaper there, reducing the benefit of automation. But as leading industrial landlords begin to make the transition, the topic of who is going to pay for it is coming up more, market participants say.\par \par \uc2 Chinese e-commerce giants, such as \uc2 JD.com Inc\uc2 ., Suning.com Group Co. and \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 ., are now making big investments into the smart-warehouse real-estate sector as they look for an edge over rivals to deliver packages faster. In October, for example, \uc2 JD.com\uc2  began operating its first fully automated warehouse it owns in Shanghai.\par \par \uc2 For now, China is a landlords' market, making it easier for them to fend off requests from tenants to put up money to upgrade smart warehouses. Vacancy rates are at a record low, analysts say.\par \par \uc2 Still, landlords may want to invest in smart warehouses to increase chances of approvals from local governments, as Beijing positions China as a global leader in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other high-tech development.\par \par \uc2 Also, some market participants say expectations are changing rapidly. "We're definitely entering an era where it's no longer, 'Come and lease my building,' " said Stuart Ross, head of Chinese industrial property for JLL. "It also has to have high-level tech."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Peter Grant contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180801000025"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180801ee810000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Revenues from trading were mostly down while investment banking was\u160\'00\'A0 mostly up. Retail banking arms kept churning out solid figures more or less unblemished by consumer or corporate delinquencies.\par \par \uc2 But one word kept popping up: digital.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , the theme arose a handful of times on the earnings call, in the context of automated tools for financial advisers (\uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 ) and the push into consumer banking (Goldman). At the big retail banks, meanwhile, it seemed that digital was all executives wanted to talk about. The word got six mentions at \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2 , 11 at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , 18 at Citi and 29 at \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The preoccupation with digital reflects the steady rise of independent\u160\'00\'A0 apps and platforms, many of which have spent years chiselling away at the banks\u8217\'20\'19 market shares in areas such as consumer loans, wealth management and checking accounts. Many of the biggest brick-and-mortar banks were slow off the mark in developing tools of their own. But now the message from Wall Street seems emphatic: we\u8217\'20\'19ve caught up, and we\u8217\'20\'19re crushing it.\par \par \uc2 BofA, for instance, talked about crossing the 25m threshold during the quarter, in terms of active users of its mobile app. Another 10m used other digital channels (see charts below). All in, that\u8217\'20\'19s about 80 times more than SoFi, the biggest of the independent upstarts, which says it had about 430,000 \u8220\'20\'1Cmembers\u8221\'20\'1D in January.\par \par \uc2 BofA talked about\u160\'00\'A0Erica, its virtual assistant which it began to roll out across the country in March. Erica had interactions with 2m users in July, the bank said, up from 50,000 in April. The bank boasted of strong growth at Zelle,\u160\'00\'A0the big banks\u8217\'20\'19 answer to Venmo, the fast-growing money-transfer service from \uc2 PayPal\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Brian Moynihan\uc2 , BofA's chairman and chief executive, also talked about its new online mortgage application, which he called a \u8220\'20\'1Ctrue end-to-end digital experience".\u160\'00\'A0It is taking aim at upstarts like Better and Lenda, boosted by a series of expensive-looking ads on \uc2 youtube\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Size matters, said Mr Moynihan, on the bank\u8217\'20\'19s results call with analysts. \u8220\'20\'1CThe important thing is the size of our consumer base allows those investments to be leveraged.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The big banks aren\u8217\'20\'19t just building their own. Goldman talked about its acquisition in April of\u160\'00\'A0 Clarity Money, a personal finance start-up, which gave it access to more than 1m users. At the time, Goldman executives said that they would look to use the Clarity app to offer products and services from\u160\'00\'A0 Marcus, the bank\u8217\'20\'19s new retail-banking arm which has generated about $4bn of consumer loans since launch.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt's the emphasis on making it an easy user experience, leading with the behavioural economics, a better service,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Marty Chavez\uc2 , Goldman\u8217\'20\'19s chief financial officer, on the Clarity purchase. \u8220\'20\'1CWe know this is a competitive and commoditised business, and we know that we have to differentiate ourselves and are on our way into it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Direct contact with\u160\'00\'A0 ordinary consumers \u160\'00\'A0does not come naturally to Goldman, which has focused on big companies and the ultra-wealthy for almost all of its 149-year history. After the financial crisis, in fact, the bank came to be associated with \u8220\'20\'1Ca great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity,\u8221\'20\'1D in the lurid phrase of Rolling Stone writer \uc2 Matt Taibbi\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s now way out of line, said Marcus chief Harit Talwar, at a New York conference last month. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re like a loveable teddy bear.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Further fintech fascination\par \par \uc2 Amazing inertia\u160\'00\'A0They say that people in the UK are more likely to get divorced than split with their bank. What kind of \u8220\'20\'1Cunreasonable behaviour\u8221\'20\'1D would it take for you to\u160\'00\'A0 ditch your current account provider? An awful lot if the evidence from TSB is anything to go by. After suffering one of the most expensive systems outages in British banking history, net customer losses from TSB in\u160\'00\'A0the second quarter were a puny sounding 6,000 customers. TSB reported that while about 26,000 customers switched their account away from TSB in this period, more than 20,000 customers opened a new bank account or switched to TSB.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 App pay\u160\'00\'A0The number of mobile payments users who tap to pay using a contactless payment solution provided by their mobile device\u8217\'20\'19s maker will grow to 450m people worldwide by 2020, according to a new forecast from Juniper Research. By this time, Apple Pay will have amassed the largest audience,\u160\'00\'A0accounting for 1 in 2 of these mobile payment users globally,\u160\'00\'A0TechCrunch reports.\par \par \uc2 Celtic deal\u160\'00\'A0TransferMate, the Irish-based digital payments company, has signed a strategic partnership with Dutch bank ING, which is\u160\'00\'A0investing \u8364\'20\'AC21m\u160\'00\'A0for a stake\u160\'00\'A0in the company. The Dutch lender will offer Transfermate's cross-border payment services to\u160\'00\'A0its small business and corporate clients.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Fintech\u160\'00\'A0views in the\u160\'00\'A0FT\u160\'00\'A0banking podcast\par \par \uc2 Bits and bobs\par \par \uc2 Boom time\u160\'00\'A0Fintech investment roared ahead at a record pace in the first half of the year, with $57.9bn invested across 875 deals, a significant increase from the $38.1bn invested in all of 2017, according to\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 KPMG\uc2 's Pulse of Fintech report. There were nine $1bn-plus deals by fintech companies, including the $14bn fundraising by China's \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2  and the $12.9bn takeover of the UK's Worldpay.\u160\'00\'A0At a technology level, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and robotic process automation continued to gain attention while interest in blockchain, insurtech and regtech also grew significantly.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Plus ca change\u160\'00\'A0We've been told for a few years now that fintech start-ups such as Monzo, Revolut and Starling Bank were coming for the high street banks' lunch. But, judging by a new set of data, they haven't even got started on their breakfast. Mobile data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company Ogury found the top ten most-used UK \u8220\'20\'1Cbanking\u8221\'20\'1D apps, which include the fintech hopefuls, were all traditional high-street lenders,\u160\'00\'A0reports Alphaville.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin blow\u160\'00\'A0The Winklevoss twins\u8217\'20\'19 dream of launching a bitcoin ETF was\u160\'00\'A0 dealt another blow \u160\'00\'A0as the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  ruled that \uc2 Cboe Global Markets\uc2  could not list and trade shares in their cryptocurrency fund. The SEC said that Cboe had not put forward convincing arguments in favour of listing the \uc2 Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust\uc2  and dismissed its suggestion that cryptocurrency markets are inherently resistant to manipulation. Meanwhile\u160\'00\'A0bitcoin climbed\u160\'00\'A0 above $8,000 \u160\'00\'A0for the first time since May.\par \par \uc2 Peer review\u160\'00\'A0The UK financial regulator is planning to\u160\'00\'A0 crack down \u160\'00\'A0on peer-to-peer lenders and crowdfunding platforms, following concerns that investors could be taking on more risk than they realise. In a long-awaited review, the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0said it was worried that a rise in interest rates could trigger a spate of defaults on many of the high-risk loans that peer-to-peer lending websites facilitate.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180731ee7v0035x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Chinese investors have been buying commercial property domestically at the fastest rate ever as new institutions and funds join the market and traditional players focus more on their home shores in response to government-imposed capital controls on offshore investment.\par \par \uc2 Domestic buyers purchased a record $564.9 billion worth of office buildings, shopping centers, development sites and other commercial property in China last year, according to real-estate data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . By comparison, domestic buyers did $395.8 billion in such deals in 2016, the firm said. The lion's share of the deals each year involved development sites.\par \par \uc2 Domestic investors pulled back slightly in the early part of this year as Beijing began raising concerns about debt and financial risk. But the government has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-effort-to-control-debt-loses-steam-1531410115"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 eased that pressure lately to stimulate a softening economy }}}\uc2 and ease market worries over escalating trade tensions with the U.S.\par \par \uc2 "There is obviously more domestic capital chasing transactions in China," said Rush Desai, chief executive of the Asia and Pacific region for Allianz Real Estate, the real-estate investment unit of \uc2 Allianz SE\uc2 , the Munich-based financial-services firm.\par \par \uc2 The sharp increase in investment by Chinese investors is helping turn the Chinese real-estate market into one of the largest in the world. Including acquisitions by Hong Kong firms and other foreign investors, there was a total of $633.4 billion in deals last year, up from $456.2 billion in 2016, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the surge in domestic activity is driving up prices making the market trickier for foreign investors to compete. Some have moved to the sidelines. Others are still very much in the game but are fine-tuning their investment strategies.\par \par \uc2 Chicago-based \uc2 LaSalle Investment Management Inc\uc2 ., which has about $60 billion in real-estate assets under management, in April acquired Shanghai International Plaza, a mixed-use tower with 24 stories of office space on a six-story retail podium, for an undisclosed price. LaSalle is planning to make the investment work partly by converting some of the retail space into more desirable office space.\par \par \uc2 LaSalle is confident it can do this because it has more than a decade of experience investing in the country, said Claire Tang, the firm's head of acquisitions for China. "We are foreign capital, but our team has local expertise," she said.\par \par \uc2 The Chinese real-estate market is young compared with those in the U.S. and Europe. Until the development surge of the past two decades, major markets didn't have enough buildings with the design quality or leasing structures to appeal to institutional investors.\par \par \uc2 The first foreign investors in Chinese property didn't start showing up until the 1980s, after the government eased restrictions on such deals. Since then a wide range of major foreign players have done deals in the country including \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , New York developer Tishman Speyer and mall giant \uc2 Simon Property Group\uc2  and \uc2 Brookfield Property Partners\uc2 , one of the world's largest commercial real-estate investors.\par \par \uc2 The appeal: diversification and the high growth rate of the Chinese economy, which is expected to translate into higher rents and occupancies.\par \par \uc2 "We are trying to participate in the Chinese economy whereby it's transitioning from being a manufacturing [economy] to where it's becoming more of a service-based economy," said Mr. Desai of \uc2 Allianz\uc2 , which has invested about \u8364\'20\'AC1 billion ($1.17 billion) of equity in China since 2016.\par \par \uc2 Allianz\uc2 's deals this year includes its venture with Gaw Capital Partners, a Hong Kong-based private-equity firm, to purchase two of the four offices blocks in Sky Soho complex in Shanghai. "The location is where you would expect the central business district to expand," Mr. Desai said.\par \par \uc2 Chinese domestic investors used to be mostly individuals and family offices. But in recent years more institutional players like insurance companies and homegrown private-equity firms have become more active.\par \par \uc2 "There's a local saying that the Chinese real-estate industry has come into the second round," said Megan Hu, managing director of World Union Investment, a Shanghai-based firm which currently has about six billion yuan ($880 million) under management.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hu's firm was formed in 2014 as the investment arm of Shenzhen-based World Union, one of China's largest real-estate services firms, which specializes mostly in residential property. Most recently, it acquired Cross Tower, a 24-floor office building in Shanghai, for 2.7 billion yuan.\par \par \uc2 Domestic investors have had more firepower lately because of pressure from Beijing for them to pull back on their yearslong foreign buying spree. For example, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-real-estate-investors-retreat-from-u-s-as-political-pressure-mounts-1532437934"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Chinese investors in the U.S. became net sellers of commercial property}}}\uc2  in the second quarter of this year, for the first time since 2008.\par \par \uc2 "With China capping the amount of money that can go out of the country, that traps capital in the country," said Michael Cole, founder of the real-estate website mingtiandi.com.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hu said that domestic investors often have an advantage over foreign investors, who may have to face more government restrictions. Big Chinese institutions also "may have access to cheaper financing" than their foreign competitors, she said.\par \par \uc2 But other foreign investors believe they can still hold their own. "We have differentiated ourselves by being able to do all cash deals," said Mr. Desai of \uc2 Allianz Real Estate\uc2 . "We bring certainty of execution because we don't need leverage all the time. That helps us find transactions that are attractive to the rest of the market."\par \par \uc2 Write to Peter Grant at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:peter.grant@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 peter.grant@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/theme-park-developments-in-china-hit-crossroads-real-or-pixie-dust-1533034801"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Theme Park Developments in China Hit Crossroads: Real or Pixie Dust?}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-online-shopping-giants-open-thousands-of-bricks-and-mortar-stores-1533034801"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 China's Online Shopping Giants Open Thousands of Bricks-and-Mortar Stores}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brookfield-asset-management-to-acquire-forest-city-for-11-4-billion-including-debt-1533045666?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Brookfield Asset Management to Acquire Forest City}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180731ee7v001up\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Entrepreneurs from such neighbouring hardware and software outfits often end up collaborating. \u8220\'20\'1CThe internet of things means a lot of companies straddle the line between hardware and software,\u8221\'20\'1D says Ilana Diamond, AlphaLab Gear\u8217\'20\'19s managing director. \u8220\'20\'1CThey can benefit from running into each other in the hall.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Big tech companies are also becoming involved. In an area now known as Robotics Row, comprising the Strip District and Lawrenceville neighbourhoods, robotics and autonomous vehicles companies have set up shop, including Uber\u8217\'20\'19s Advanced Technologies Group, which focuses on self-driving technologies, mapping and vehicle safety. On Bakery Square, near the Shadyside neighbourhood, \uc2 Google\uc2  has set up offices in a former factory of Nabisco, the bakery product and snack manufacturer.\par \par \uc2 Inward investment in the technology sector from overseas and from other US states rose from $33.4m in 2009 to almost $55m in 2017, according to fDi Intelligence, a \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  data service tracking cross-border investment flows.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COver the past decade or so, Pittsburgh has far outpaced the nation\u8217\'20\'19s average growth in tech and venture capital investing,\u8221\'20\'1D says Rich Lunak, chief executive of Innovation Works, the seed stage investor that supports AlphaLab and AlphaLab Gear.\par \par \uc2 In the 1980s, it was state funding that helped kick-start the tech sector. In the wake of the steel industry\u8217\'20\'19s collapse, Ben Franklin Technology Partners, one of the country\u8217\'20\'19s oldest tech-based economic development initiatives, was established to provide support for start-ups including access to capital and business expertise.\par \par \uc2 The city\u8217\'20\'19s latest generation of tech entrepreneurs stands on the shoulders of local giants such as \uc2 Carnegie Mellon University\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize winner considered a founding father of technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Adding to the city\u8217\'20\'19s academic and research clout is the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh\uc2 , a life sciences leader, and the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\uc2  (UPMC), which announced last year it would put $2bn into developing new digitally focused speciality hospitals.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn the industries driving the fourth industrial revolution \u8212\'20\'14 AI, robotics, autonomous vehicles, nanotechnology, biology \u8212\'20\'14 Pittsburgh has leadership in almost every one,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Lunak.\par \par \uc2 The physical proximity of these research institutions, all in the city\u8217\'20\'19s Oakland district, has also helped, says Evan Facher, head of the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Innovation Institute. \u8220\'20\'1CYou have 1.7 square miles where the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh\uc2 , \uc2 Carnegie Mellon\uc2  and the healthcare system [UPMC] sit,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CSo you have a huge density of ideas being created in a really small area.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Even so, the city has gaps to fill as it builds its reputation as a tech and innovation hub, including the lack of a well-established local venture capital industry. \u8220\'20\'1CHistorically, we\u8217\'20\'19ve not had a lot of indigenous venture capital resident here,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Lunak.\par \par \uc2 Rob Rutenbar, the University of Pittsburgh\u8217\'20\'19s senior vice-chancellor for research, agrees: \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a bunch of venture in the neighbourhood. But it\u8217\'20\'19s not at the scale of either of the coasts.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Moreover, while big companies such as Ford, \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Uber are setting up offices in Pittsburgh, no global tech business has made its headquarters there.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CRight now we don\u8217\'20\'19t have a \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jim Jen, AlphaLab director.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat we would like to have is companies growing to that scale, creating the anchor companies here. That would speed things up and bring more scale and financial returns for investors.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180730ee7u000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 The cynical view is that S&P Dow Jones and MSCI stand in way of lower costs\par \par \uc2 I was chatting with the boss of a large, newish player in the world of passive investing when exchange traded funds and the tricky subject of indices came up.\par \par \uc2 I say tricky because virtually everyone I talk to at a senior level in ETF-land seems to be spending a disproportionate amount of time working out how to lop costs and cut out the big index companies.\par \par \uc2 The driver is obvious: the race to ever-lower total expense ratios. Big index firms such as S&P Dow Jones and MSCI, it is alleged, stand in the way of this race because of their basis point and licensing fee structure.\par \par \uc2 On paper, I wholeheartedly agree with this cynical view, mainly because these large outfits are classic examples of what economists call rent-seeking corporates, trading off their brand (and to be fair, hard work), forcing businesses to pay an entry fee for access to legally protected brands.\par \par \uc2 I\u8217\'20\'19d be happy, come the revolution, if we could find a way of open-sourcing indices, perhaps through blockchain. Back in the real world the alternatives don\u8217\'20\'19t look quite so attractive.\par \par \uc2 Self-indexing is a popular option with some, as is the idea of using a lesser-known index company to do the boring number-crunching and calculating but keeping the issuer\u8217\'20\'19s brand name for marketing purposes. This makes sense but for one fly in the ointment \u8212\'20\'14 having someone to blame.\par \par \uc2 There have been attempts to build the index version of generic drugs (S&P 500 indices in all but actual name) but most end-investors tend to like a familiar name on the box.\par \par \uc2 So, for the really deep, liquid pools of equities and to a lesser degree bonds, the big brand names built around an exchange heritage are probably safe for now.\par \par \uc2 This means that most of the innovation has erupted in what I call outcome-based indices, ie, where an issuer working with an index company is trying to filter the market to get the right outcome for investors.\par \par \uc2 Two examples jump to mind, one mild, the other potentially lethal. Many multi-factor strategies, combining different factor tilts look eminently sensible on paper but could end up producing what I call \u8220\'20\'1Cmushy\u8221\'20\'1D results.\par \par \uc2 By this I mean that the investor says: \u8220\'20\'1CThis looks almost exactly like the returns from a broad market cap index but with higher fees.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As the investor begins to dig, they discover that what\u8217\'20\'19s inside the black box of the multi-factor is in effect a pale shadow of the well-known broad market index. They will need someone to blame.\par \par \uc2 My guess is at that point the issuer will say: \u8220\'20\'1CAh, well, we did get an index firm in and they said this was the best strategy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Such buck-passing may not rescue the situation but it will deflect some blame. At which point you need some well-funded, cash-rich indexing company to step in and defend the daft strategy behind the multi-index idea.\par \par \uc2 A variation of the theme centres on low or minimum-volatility strategies \u8212\'20\'14 what happens in the next downturn when a badly designed index blows up and investors discover they have a mixture of overpriced, quality stocks that are now egregiously overpriced in a market sell-off?\par \par \uc2 A deadlier variant could occur in thematic index investing where some crazy idea for a sexy fund \u8212\'20\'14 a mutant combination, say, of blockchain, genetics and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the title \u8212\'20\'14 ends up with a portfolio of mid and small-cap basket cases.\par \par \uc2 In sum, lots of listed businesses worth zilch. As the index and its ETF plunge in value, I can imagine the reasoning in class-action lawyers\u8217\'20\'19 fee-obsessed minds: \u8220\'20\'1CHow on earth did Business X make it past the screen?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In these circumstances, one needs the index equivalent of high street banks and payment protection insurance \u8212\'20\'14 that is, well-funded businesses with layers of management on hand to explain what went wrong.\par \par \uc2 This also means that in the good times these index firms will also need to step up their education efforts and explain precisely how they build factor/ESG/thematic indices.\par \par \uc2 Crucially these highly profitable monsters will need to get out more often and talk to retail investors \u8212\'20\'14 it is no good simply relying on relationships with a few choice institutional clients.\par \par \uc2 The index firms need to earn their rent and engage more openly. If they don\u8217\'20\'19t, the regulators should force them to do so.\par \par \uc2 Don\u8217\'20\'19t be too keen to see them go the way of the dinosaurs. When the next meltdown occurs, there will be plenty of ETF issuers in need of someone to blame for their ill-conceived products.\par \par \uc2 David Stevenson is editor of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.etfstream.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.etfstream.com}}}\uc2  and the Adventurous Investor columnist for FT Money\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180730ee7u0005m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Entrepreneurs from such neighbouring hardware and software outfits often end up collaborating. "The internet of things means a lot of companies straddle the line between hardware and software," says Ilana Diamond, AlphaLab Gear's managing director. "They can benefit from running into each other in the hall."\par \par \uc2 Big tech companies are also becoming involved. In an area now known as Robotics Row, comprising the Strip District and Lawrenceville neighbourhoods, robotics and autonomous vehicles companies have set up shop, including Uber's Advanced Technologies Group, which focuses on self-driving technologies, mapping and vehicle safety. On Bakery Square, near the Shadyside neighbourhood, \uc2 Google\uc2  has set up offices in a former factory of Nabisco, the bakery product and snack manufacturer.\par \par \uc2 Inward investment in the technology sector from overseas and from other US states rose from $33.4m in 2009 to almost $55m in 2017, according to fDi Intelligence, a \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  data service tracking cross-border investment flows.\par \par \uc2 "Over the past decade or so, Pittsburgh has far outpaced the nation's average growth in tech and venture capital investing," says Rich Lunak, chief executive of Innovation Works, the seed stage investor that supports AlphaLab and AlphaLab Gear.\par \par \uc2 In the 1980s, it was state funding that helped kick-start the tech sector. In the wake of the steel industry's collapse, Ben Franklin Technology Partners, one of the country's oldest tech-based eco-nomic development initiatives, was established to provide support for startups including access to capital and business expertise.\par \par \uc2 The city's latest generation of tech entrepreneurs stands on the shoulders of local giants such as \uc2 Carnegie Mellon University\uc2 's Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize winner considered a founding father of technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Adding to the city's academic and research clout is the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh\uc2 , a life sciences leader, and the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\uc2  (UPMC), which announced last year it would put $2bn into developing new digitally focused speciality hospitals.\par \par \uc2 "In the industries driving the fourth industrial revolution \u8212\'20\'14 AI, robotics, autonomous vehicles, nanotechnology, biology \u8212\'20\'14 Pittsburgh has leadership in almost every one," says Mr Lunak.\par \par \uc2 The physical proximity of these research institutions, all in the city's Oakland district, has also helped, says Evan Facher, head of the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh\uc2 's Innovation Institute. "You have 1.7 square miles where the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh\uc2 , \uc2 Carnegie Mellon\uc2  and the healthcare system [UPMC] sit," he says. "So you have a huge density of ideas being created in a really small area."\par \par \uc2 Even so, the city has gaps to fill as it builds its reputation as a tech and innovation hub, including the lack of a wellestablished local venture capital industry. "Historically, we've not had a lot of indigenous venture capital resident here," says Mr Lunak.\par \par \uc2 Rob Rutenbar, the University of Pittsburgh's senior vice-chancellor for research, agrees: "There's a bunch of venture in the neighbourhood. But it's not at the scale of either of the coasts."\par \par \uc2 Moreover, while big companies such as \uc2 Ford\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Uber are setting up offices in Pittsburgh, no global tech business has made its headquarters there.\par \par \uc2 "Right now we don't have a \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 ," says Jim Jen, AlphaLab director. "What we would like to have is companies growing to that scale, creating the anchor companies here. That would speed things up and bring more scale and financial returns for investors."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180730ee7u000bw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

ASSET MANAGEMENT Its boss had an ambition to build Europe's biggest asset manager to compete with US rivals and avoid being squeezed in its home market. Amundi has achieved that target but now faces different pressures. By Owen Walker\par \par \uc2 W ithin days of taking over at \uc2 Cr\u233\'00\'E9dit Agricole\uc2 's asset management division, \uc2 Yves Perrier\uc2  knew the business could only survive by doubling in size. It was late 2007 and while other executives at the French bank were grappling with the early signs of the financial crisis. Mr Perrier was starting to put together a strategy to turn the parochial unit \u8212\'20\'14 with assets of \u8364\'20\'AC480bn \u8212\'20\'14 into one of the world's biggest investment businesses.\par \par \uc2 "We wanted to be number one in Europe," he says.\par \par \uc2 His first step to meeting that target was to partner with the asset management branch of a former employer, French banking rival \uc2 Soci\u233\'00\'E9t\u233\'00\'E9 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale\uc2 . He convinced senior managers at the two lenders to merge and spin off their fund management arms, creating Amundi in 2010. Years of fervent asset gathering followed, culminating in the \u8364\'20\'AC3.7bn acquisition of \uc2 Pioneer Investments\uc2 , the fund management business of \uc2 UniCredit\uc2 , the Italian bank, 12 months ago.\par \par \uc2 In parallel Mr Perrier also developed a plan to "industrialise" the business: boosting assets under management while driving down the cost of running it. Despite some internal opposition the ultimate aim was to build a company that could compete with the very biggest players in asset management: the trillion dollar club, which includes just a handful of names, such as \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  and \uc2 State Street\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Amundi was inducted into that club in 2016 just months after Mr Perrier took it public in the biggest flotation on the Paris stock exchange for a decade. The IPO raised \u8364\'20\'AC1.5bn for Mr Perrier's acquisition strategy and valued the group, still 80 per cent owned by \uc2 Cr\u233\'00\'E9dit Agricole\uc2 , at \u8364\'20\'AC7.5bn.\par \par \uc2 But now Mr Perrier's vision is under intense scrutiny. The company's shares have lost a fifth of their value in recent months as a result of a flood of outflows from its Italian business, amid the country's political turmoil. But the questions confronting Amundi go beyond Italy: they strike at the heart of the group's strategy of using acquisitions and greater scale to withstand the immense challenges that the industry faces.\par \par \uc2 "If we think these [Italian outflows] are a one off, then fine. But if it is the start of a longer trend, then that's a concern," says Haley Tam, managing director of European diversified financials at \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Asset managers play a critical role in the global economy, such as investing the retirement savings of hundreds of millions of workers. But while their influence has grown, the industry is undergoing profound changes that threaten the way they do business.\par \par \uc2 Fees are under pressure as customers move to cheaper products and costs are rising because of new regulatory burdens. And unlike the largest US managers, which invested heavily in developing passive funds over the past two decades, Europe's managers have tended to focus on more traditional pricier products such as actively managed funds. Supporters believe Mr Perrier's dealmaking will give Amundi the ballast to survive these problems at a time when other European asset managers are being forced to pull out of markets and lay off staff. But others warn that Amundi's growth spurt could just be a way of delaying the harsh realities in an industry that \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2  likened last year to an exhausted athlete, accelerating, as they charge downhill.\par \par \uc2 "If assets stay the same or drop \u8212\'20\'14 which we expect \u8212\'20\'14 then you face the perfect storm of fees coming down, assets coming down and costs going up," says Renaud Fages, a partner at BCG. "Historically asset managers would just cut back bonuses in bad times. But that is not sustainable and will not be enough in the current environment. Instead they will have to start thinking hard about more fundamental changes."\par \par \uc2 Survival strategy The zeal to expand has spread across the asset management industry as executives came to the conclusion that their businesses will be consumed unless they are able to join the ranks of the very biggest players. M&A strategies have become less about market domination and more about survival.\par \par \uc2 On the surface that looks to have worked. Assets under management swelled to record levels in 2017. But most of that accumulation was the result of strong returns on the back of rampant equity markets. Managers are still being squeezed by long-term pressures that have fundamentally disrupted the industry.\par \par \uc2 One of the main drags has been the continual downward pressure on fees that began in the US and has spread to Europe. The rise in popularity of cheaper passive investing, where funds are designed to mimic an index, has forced traditional active managers to consider setting up passive products themselves and rethink their pricing.\par \par \uc2 Over the past two years, the amount of new investor money flowing into passive funds increased their total assets by 19 per cent, while active funds grew by just 1 per cent, according to \uc2 Oliver Wyman\uc2 , the consultancy. Active products still account for the vast majority \u8212\'20\'14 more than two-thirds \u8212\'20\'14 of managed money, but passives are catching up.\par \par \uc2 While a mountain of cash has flowed out of active products and into passives in recent years, the biggest cause of fall-ing fees is active managers reducing their prices to be more competitive. Over the past three years global charges across all funds, including passive and active products, have reduced by 3 per cent a year, according to BCG. For certain types of funds, the average fees have dropped by more than a third.\par \par \uc2 "In the past decade institutional investors have become more sophisticated and are putting more pressure on asset managers over fees," says Mr Fages. "Retail investors are being more sensitive on price and regulations are pushing them in that direction."\par \par \uc2 Technology costs Asset managers also face higher costs.\par \par \uc2 Since the financial crisis, the fund industry has been hit by an avalanche of regulation resulting in increased operational spending. They are also engaged in an expensive technology arms race \u8212\'20\'14 from \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data mining tools to distribution platforms \u8212\'20\'14 in a bid to stay in touch with competitors.\par \par \uc2 Lower fees and higher costs result in squeezed profits. BCG calculates that the average asset manager's profit margin has been cut from 41 per cent a decade ago, to 38 per cent today. While still a highly profitable industry, the reduction has had a profound impact on how managers allocate capital, say analysts. BCG expects margins to fall to 36 per cent by 2021.\par \par \uc2 Mr Fages says this fall in profit margins could force companies to close product lines, pulling out of markets and cutting jobs. \uc2 Axa Investment\uc2  Managers, the French active investment house, last month announced it would lay off up to 9 per cent of its global workforce in a move it said was partly driven by the need to invest in technology.\par \par \uc2 Oliver Wyman\uc2  calculates that investment managers with more than $500bn in assets are more than twice as efficient as those controlling less than $100bn. However, the more complex the business, the more bloated its cost base. It means that European managers selling products in several markets cost up to 20 per cent more than US managers based only in North America.\par \par \uc2 According to Mr Perrier, these pressures have created an industry where the very largest are able to mop up assets, cut costs and reinvest in the pur-suit of growth, while smaller managers can continue to offer specialist products at a premium. Those caught in the middle are struggling to compete. "There is room for only two kinds of players," he says. "Those like Amundi \u8212\'20\'14 to a certain extent, we are a small Black-Rock \u8212\'20\'14 that will be asset gatherers, managing all asset classes with a global presence. But, you have room also for boutiques specialising in certain asset classes."\par \par \uc2 Coveting assets In November 2015, armed with the new firepower provided by the IPO, Mr Perrier set about pursuing potential deals to ensure that Amundi did not get caught in that middle ground. One business he had long coveted was \uc2 Pioneer Investments\uc2 , the fund management arm of Italian bank \uc2 UniCredit\uc2 . \uc2 Pioneer\uc2  was another business that had not fared well in a market that favoured providers of cheaper investment products.\par \par \uc2 He had first tried to buy \uc2 Pioneer\uc2  in 2012, but the deal was scuppered when \uc2 UniCredit\uc2  changed its chief executive and Italian regulators pushed back against it. Mr Perrier returned with a new offer in mid-2016, had the deal agreed by the end of that year and the $3.7bn transaction was complete by July 2017. The tie-up is designed to save \u8364\'20\'AC180m within three years. It also took the group's assets under management from \u8364\'20\'AC850bn to \u8364\'20\'AC1.1tn.\par \par \uc2 The deal made Amundi Europe's biggest asset manager. By leapfrogging over \uc2 Legal & General Investment Management\uc2  it rose from 16th to eighth globally, entrenching it in the trillion dollar club. A year on, its assets stand at \u8364\'20\'AC1.4tn, making it the sole European asset manager in the world's top 10.\par \par \uc2 However, a former Amundi executive warns that while the expansion up to now has been impressive, much of its organic growth is in lower revenue areas such as passive investing and fixed income. "I don't know how sustainable that is," he says. "You will see margins erode over time."\par \par \uc2 He adds that though the deal helped Amundi grow in the lucrative Italian and US markets, as well as bringing in \uc2 Pioneer\uc2 's high-performing investment teams, there are big cultural differences between the two companies that will need to be ironed out.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Yves Perrier\uc2  would say there is one star at Amundi and that is Amundi itself," he says. "If you are a well-regarded portfolio manager at Pioneer, that's not what you want to hear."\par \par \uc2 Italian outflows have been blamed for the share price plunge in the past two months. However, Toni Dang, director of equity research at \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , says this is an over-reaction by the market to problems in Italy that have little to do with Amundi's long-term strategy. "Amundi had a bit of a wobble in the second quarter, but it remains one of my top picks," she says, adding that it is one of the most disciplined on cost of all European asset managers.\par \par \uc2 Mauro Baratta\uc2 , vice-president of global distribution solutions at Broadridge, a consultancy, says the integration of the \uc2 Pioneer\uc2  business is still taking its toll on the business. There were scores of overlapping funds between the two businesses that needed to be closed or merged. "They are still going through this massive clean-up operation," he says. "When you undergo this type of restructuring, sales will be affected."\par \par \uc2 Amundi's midyear results on Thursday will be scrutinised for signs of progress on that front.\par \par \uc2 Yet the former Amundi executive points to an equally big risk facing the company: while the rise has been driven by Mr Perrier, there is no obvious successor to the 63-year-old Frenchman. "I'm not aware of another asset manager that is as top-down. You take Yves out of the equation and the company does not function," he says. "If he was to step down in a year or two there would be one hell of a succession battle."\par \par \uc2 "Amundi is a remarkable European success story and the management deserve a huge amount of credit for that," he adds. "Whether they can continue that trajectory will be a challenge."\par \par \uc2 Scaling up \uc2 Yves Perrier\uc2  took Amundi public in 2015 in the biggest flotation in Paris for a decade, raising \u8364\'20\'AC1.5bn Falling fees Throughout the industry active managers have reduced their prices in a bid to be more competitive Ticking over One former executive says much of Amundi's organic growth is in lower revenue areas like fixed income M&A Groups merge to survive against the index trackers Between 2011 and 2016, there was an average of 142 mergers and acquisitions a year involving asset managers. That number spiked at 208 last year, according to investment bank Sandler O'Neill. The volume of assets managed by companies involved in those deals more than doubled from $1.3tn in 2011 to $2.9tn last year. Several of the biggest took place in Europe, as traditional investment managers tried to compete with more technologically advanced US rivals.\par \par \uc2 In late 2016, Anglo-Australian fund manager Henderson Group agreed to merge with US rival \uc2 Janus Capital\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 home of veteran bond investor \uc2 Bill Gross\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 in a $6.4bn deal that would create an investment house managing $331bn. Both groups, which specialise in active management, had struggled with the rise of technology-driven passive investment.\par \par \uc2 While Janus and Henderson painted the union \u8212\'20\'14 completed in May 2017 \u8212\'20\'14 as one aimed at growing their geographic spread and increasing their suite of products, analysts were more sceptical. They saw it as a defensive move by two struggling mid-size managers in a market that increasingly favours the very big or the very small.\par \par \uc2 "There have been profound changes in the asset management industry and people have started to question their business models," says Andrew Formica, a 20-year Henderson veteran who negotiated the deal with Janus. "We feel we moved early on this trend and have positioned ourselves well."\par \par \uc2 A second major merger was struck just months later when two Scottish neighbours \u8212\'20\'14 Standard Life and \uc2 Aberdeen Asset Management\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 agreed to combine. Again, both parties were middling global asset managers struggling to cope with the increased appetite for cheaper index-tracking funds. The \u163\'00\'A311bn merger to create \uc2 Standard Life Aberdeen\uc2  was completed last June.\par \par \uc2 'If we think these [Italian outflows] are a one off, then fine.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Intel's career website advertises a position for a components researcher in Hillsboro, Ore. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the opening was in Ohio. (July 29, 2018)\par \par \uc2 Americans looking to land a first job or break into a dream career face their best odds of success in years.\par \par \uc2 Employers say they are abandoning preferences for college degrees and specific skill sets to speed up hiring and broaden the pool of job candidates. Many companies added requirements to job postings after the recession, when millions were out of work and human-resources departments were stacked with r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9s.\par \par \uc2 Across incomes and industries, the lower bar to getting hired is helping self-taught programmers attain software engineering roles at \uc2 Intel Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 GitHub Inc\uc2 ., the coding platform, and improving the odds for high-school graduates who aspire to be branch managers at \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 . and Terminix pest control.\par \par \uc2 "Candidates have so many options today," said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Group, a staffing agency with about 10,000 company clients in search of employees. "If a company requires a degree, two rounds of interviews and a test for hard skills, candidates can go down the street to another employer who will make them an offer that day."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Glaser estimates one in four of the agency's employer clients have made drastic changes to their recruiting process since the start of the year, such as skipping drug tests or criminal background checks, or removing preferences for a higher degree or high-school diploma.\par \par \uc2 Cutting job-credential requirements is more common in cities such as Dallas and Louisville, where unemployment is lowest, Ms. Glaser said, as well as in recruiting for roles at call centers and warehouses within logistics operations of retailers such as \uc2 Walmart Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the first half of 2018, the share of job postings requesting a college degree fell to 30% from 32% in 2017, according to an analysis by labor-market research firm Burning Glass Technologies of 15 million ads on websites such as Indeed and \uc2 Craigslist\uc2 . Minimum qualifications have been drifting lower since 2012, when companies sought college graduates for 34% of those positions.\par \par \uc2 Long work-history requirements have also relaxed: Only 23% of entry-level jobs now ask applicants for three or more years of experience, compared with 29% back in 2012, putting an additional 1.2 million jobs in closer reach of more applicants, Burning Glass data show. Through the end of last year, a further one million new jobs were opened up to candidates with "no experience necessary," making occupations such as e-commerce analyst, purchasing assistant and preschool teacher available to novices and those without a degree.\par \par \uc2 It all marks a sharp reversal from the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, when employers could be pickier. Economists say job requirements were harder to track then, because many companies didn't post positions publicly and many r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9s weren't delivered electronically.\par \par \uc2 Now, recruiters say, the tightest job market in decades has left employers looking to tamp down hiring costs with three options: Offer more money upfront, lower their standards or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-companies-will-pay-you-to-learn-your-job-1508245202"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 retrain current staff in coding, procurement or other necessary skills}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rodney Apple, president of SCM Talent Group LLC in Asheville, N.C., said if companies won't budge on compensation, experience or education requirements, he walks away.\par \par \uc2 "We tell them, 'I'm sorry, but we can't help you fish for the few underpaid or unaware applicants left out there,' " he said. SCM finds workers for dozens of small and midsize companies seeking supply-chain managers and logistics and warehouse operators across the U.S. Mr. Apple said talent shortages are more extreme than he has seen in nearly 20 years of recruiting.\par \par \uc2 Average wages have climbed steadily in the past year, but rising prices of household goods {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-prices-increase-at-fastest-annual-rate-since-2012-1531398709"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 have made those pay raises less valuable to workers}}}\uc2 , keeping pressure on employers to increase salaries or re-evaluate their target hire.\par \par \uc2 To attract more entry-level employees, toy maker \uc2 Hasbro Inc\uc2 . divided four marketing jobs, which it previously designed for business-school graduates with M.B.A.s, into eight lower-level positions. The new full-time roles included a marketing coordinator, retail-planning analyst and trade merchandiser, all involving more routine activities supporting higher-level staff in the division.\par \par \uc2 Hasbro\uc2  hiring managers originally sought candidates with a two-year degree for the jobs but ultimately dropped any college requirement, a spokeswoman said. The Pawtucket, R.I. company received more than 100 applications and hired nine people.\par \par \uc2 The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facing-historic-labor-shortages-companies-snap-up-teenagers-1523895726"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 new shift, called "down skilling,"}}}\uc2  bolsters a theory articulated by Alicia Modestino, a Northeastern University economist: When more people are looking for work, companies can afford to inflate job requirements to find the best fit\u8212\'20\'14and did so as unemployment spiked in 2008.\par \par \uc2 As college graduates and midcareer professionals raised their hands for jobs as hotel managers and bookkeepers after the recession, hires with more qualifications took a larger share of positions normally filled by the 75 million U.S. workers who lack a college degree.\par \par \uc2 After the recession, Terminix raised the bar for over 1,000 pest-control branch- and service-manager positions to require a two-year degree or a bachelor's degree. In January, it reversed course and made degrees "preferred" but not mandatory, said Betsy Vincent, senior director of talent acquisition.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Whitehead worked for five years as a Terminix branch manager in Florida before he was promoted to regional director in early July. That position now accepts candidates with college degrees or equivalent experience, helping Mr. Whitehead clinch the role despite his earlier decision to enter the military instead of college.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Whitehead, 35 years old, said his approach to jobs requiring a degree has been "apply anyways if I have the right experience, and then have the education conversation if I need to," he said, acknowledging his luck in working for companies like Terminix with flexible requirements.\par \par \uc2 A lot of employers are loosening college requirements even as the proportion of Americans with a bachelor's degree continues to rise. \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 . currently has 7,500 job openings world-wide and fewer than 10% require a degree, said spokesman Andy Aldridge. Mr. Aldridge said a surprising number of jobs could be filled by nongraduates, including most of the bank's tellers and employees handling customer-service and fraud-protection calls from cardholders.\par \par \uc2 In June, the bank unveiled plans to hire 10,000 more retail workers from low-income neighborhoods over the next five years, with or without degrees, said Chris Payton, head of talent acquisition.\par \par \uc2 Not every company is relaxing requirements: Economists say positions that require high levels of technical expertise, such as information security, still need advanced knowledge.\par \par \uc2 The tech industry has been quick to dismiss credentials like a bachelor of arts degree as irrelevant, especially in emerging fields such as data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , where demand for talent has risen faster than universities can churn out new graduates.\par \par \uc2 GitHub\uc2 , recently acquired by \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 ., said it hasn't required college degrees for most positions in years. Degrees are optional for many "experienced hire" positions at chip maker \uc2 Intel\uc2 , which also has a "tech grad" job category the company describes as fitting candidates with relevant classroom or work experience from technical programs, such as coding boot camps.\par \par \uc2 Intel\uc2 's career website advertises roles, including a lab employee testing experimental devices in Santa Clara, Calif., and a components researcher improving the semiconductor process in Hillsboro, Ore., as available to candidates with a two-year degree, military training or other nondegree certifications.\par \par \uc2 Write to Kelsey Gee at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:kelsey.gee@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 kelsey.gee@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-prices-increase-at-fastest-annual-rate-since-2012-1531398709"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Inflation Is Eating Away Worker Wage Gains}}}\uc2  (July 12, 2018)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facing-historic-labor-shortages-companies-snap-up-teenagers-1523895726"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Facing Historic Labor Shortages, Companies Snap Up Teenagers}}}\uc2  (April 16, 2018)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-companies-will-pay-you-to-learn-your-job-1508245202"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 These Companies Will Pay You to Learn Your Job}}}\uc2  (Oct. 17, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180729ee7t0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The list goes on.\par \par \uc2 Analysts have for a while now been predicting a downturn in public sentiment toward \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In 2013, for instance, consulting firm \uc2 Ernst & Young\uc2  in a survey report titled The \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  Backlash said "the Golden Age of anytime, anywhere, free-for-all access to customer data" would come to end in 2018.\par \par \uc2 Regulations could slow the ability to collect \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .

While this promotes better accountability, it is primarily because "the first priority for most executives is to leverage their own internal data."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sanz Saiz estimates companies typically use only 5% to 10% of the data they collect. They would like to use more. That's why a slate of industries\u8212\'20\'14from oil to transportation to health care\u8212\'20\'14are beefing up internal data departments or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-courts-a-wary-oil-patch-1532424600"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 forging new partnerships with tech giants}}}\uc2  like \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . or \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Companies can't just leave these strategies to the tech guys, Andrew White, an analyst with tech research firm \uc2 Gartner\uc2 , said in an interview. Boards of directors need to look at the functions tied to \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  (\b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  or cloud computing, for instance) with the same rigor as executive pay, financial auditing or management succession.\par \par \uc2 "IT cannot do the type of governance we're talking about," Mr. White said. "This is a business that provides a service and they are not entirely weighing the social consequences. \u8230\'20\'26 It's not different than dealing with climate change."\par \par \uc2 Ernst & Young\uc2 's survey found nearly 80% of respondents believe companies collect data in order to line their pockets rather than to simply make life easier. "As a result, they are becoming more selective about who they share data with and a backlash is building," the firm said.\par \par \uc2 To counter this, companies must prove they can do more than simply "monetize" our data.\par \par \uc2 Think about the impact Google Maps has on a rural road like the one I live on in southeast Michigan. For years, residents have fought to keep the narrow dirt road, which was a critical thoroughfare before the Civil War, from losing its historic character.\par \par \uc2 Traffic, however, is increasingly thick because traffic-and-map apps like \uc2 Google\uc2 's direct people to use it because it will shave a minute or two from their commute. This has led to higher maintenance costs, crashes (three vehicles have wrecked in our front yard in as many years) and an increase in dust.\par \par \uc2 "Municipalities and agencies responsible for managing roads and reducing traffic are free to take measures according to their individual needs (e.g. speed humps, changing speed limits, adding traffic lights)," a company spokeswoman said. "Google Maps will then strive to reflect that reality completely and accurately in our map model."\par \par \uc2 The Cleveland Plain Dealer recently published columns on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2018/05/why_is_giant_eagle_carding_70-_1.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 real-world backlash to a \\b Big Data\\b0  grab}}}\uc2 : Older people were being {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2018/05/new_giant_eagle_policy_require.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 required to have their license swiped}}}\uc2  before buying age-restricted items at \uc2 Giant Eagle\uc2  grocery stores -- and they were concerned about the protection of their personal information.\par \par \uc2 "They're not scanning it because of your age," Roy Hewitt, a 71-year-old-retired sports editor at that paper, told me. He's clearly eligible to buy alcohol, cigarettes or propane: "My beard is older than 21."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hewitt alerted a columnist at the paper about the practice and the subsequent coverage triggered a robust response.\par \par \uc2 A Giant Eagle spokesman said: "We understand that some customers might have reservations about having their identification cards scanned and want to reassure those customers that \uc2 Giant Eagle\uc2  takes its responsibility to protect their personal data very seriously."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hewitt says he no longer gets carded, but still has a dim view. "You can't trust some banks and some companies to look at your credit and not get hacked. How in the world are you going to trust a grocery store?"\par \par \uc2 Write to John D.

In 2017, credit-reporting firm \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . disclosed that the personal information of nearly 150 million people was compromised in a data breach. Before that, \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . paid hackers $100,000 to keep secret the theft of 57 million accounts. The list goes on.\par \par \uc2 Analysts have for a while been predicting a downturn in public sentiment toward \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In 2013, for instance, consulting firm \uc2 Ernst & Young\uc2  in a survey report titled The \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  Backlash said "the Golden Age of anytime, anywhere, free-for-all access to customer data" would come to end in 2018.\par \par \uc2 Regulations could slow the ability to collect data. Take the \uc2 European Union\uc2 's new General Data Protection Regulation: Its enforcement began in late May and led to a decline of one million \uc2 Facebook\uc2  users in that region during the second quarter.\par \par \uc2 Companies are responding by appointing more chief data officers who report directly to the CEO, Ernst & Young's global \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  leader, Beatriz Sanz Saiz, said in an interview. While this promotes better accountability, it is primarily because "the first priority for most executives is to leverage their own internal data."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Sanz Saiz estimates companies typically use only 5% to 10% of the data they collect. They would like to use more. That's why a slate of industries -- from oil to transportation to health care -- are beefing up internal data departments or forging new partnerships with tech giants like \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Companies can't just leave these strategies to the tech guys, said Andrew White, an analyst with tech research firm \uc2 Gartner\uc2 . Boards of directors need to look at the functions tied to \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  (\b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  or cloud computing, for instance) with the same rigor as executive pay, financial auditing or management succession.\par \par \uc2 "IT cannot do the type of governance we're talking about," Mr. White said.\par \par \uc2 Ernst & Young\uc2 's survey found nearly 80% of respondents believe companies collect data in order to line their pockets rather than to simply make life easier for consumers. "As a result, they are becoming more selective about who they share data with and a backlash is building," the firm said.\par \par \uc2 To counter this, companies must prove they can do more than simply "monetize" our data. The Cleveland Plain Dealer recently published columns illustrating one consequence of \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  fears: Older people were being required to have their license swiped before buying age-restricted items at \uc2 Giant Eagle\uc2  grocery stores -- and they were concerned about the protection of their personal information.\par \par \uc2 "They're not scanning it because of your age," Roy Hewitt, a 71-year-old-retired sports editor at that paper, told me."My beard is older than 21." He alerted a columnist at Plain Dealer about the practice.\par \par \uc2 A Giant Eagle spokesman said: "We understand that some customers might have reservations about having their identification cards scanned and want to reassure those customers that \uc2 Giant Eagle\uc2  takes its responsibility to protect their personal data very seriously."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hewitt says he no longer gets carded, but still has a dim view. "You can't trust some banks and some companies to look at your credit and not get hacked. How in the world are you going to trust a grocery store?"\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180728000058"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180728ee7s0001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

But bigger cybersecurity budgets aren't always better, and often lead to waste, said David Stender, chief security officer at M&T Bank Corp., which has assets of about $119 billion.\par \par \uc2 "It's the wrong approach to say, \u8216\'20\'18Here's a blank check, tell us what you need and we'll buy it," said Mr. Stender, who oversees cybersecurity as well as disaster recovery, fraud and physical security for the Buffalo, N.Y., lender. "It needs to be cost-effective security, not security at any cost."\par \par \uc2 Worldwide spending on security is expected to reach $96 billion this year, up 8% from 2017 and up 17% from 2016, according to a December 2017 forecast from \uc2 Gartner Inc\uc2 . "A large portion of security spending is driven by an organization's reaction toward security breaches as more high profile cyberattacks and data breaches affect organizations worldwide," said Ruggero Contu, a Gartner research director, in a statement, citing the Equifax breach as having "a direct effect on security spend."\par \par \uc2 Part of the problem is that cybersecurity is often driven by fear instead of numbers, said Mr. Stender, who spent more than six years at the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2 , including as associate chief information officer for cybersecurity and chief information security officer. He joined \uc2 M&T Bank\uc2  in 2014.\par \par \uc2 "Much of this world is still art rather than science," he said. Unlike lending and insurance, which have hundreds of years of data to help predict risks such as loan default rates, cybersecurity is only a few decades old, he said.\par \par \uc2 Without reliable metrics to measure efficiency or the success of risk mitigation tactics, some CISOs ask for bigger budgets than necessary, said Mr. Stender. Responsible security executives should instead look to cut waste, which can be pervasive, he said.\par \par \uc2 Doubts About AI\par \par \uc2 "I think companies are spending money in the wrong way," he said. "A lot of companies try to chase that next silver bullet--\b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  being a great example--and they put way too much money into it way too early."\par \par \uc2 Proponents of AI say the technology allows companies to analyze vast amounts of data, which can help spot signs of anomalous behavior that may not be noticed by traditional tools or the human eye.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stender said AI was an example of a "shiny object you might not use or you only take advantage of 10% of it" and is generally not worth the investment. Most companies that purchase AI-based cybersecurity tools aren't ready to adopt them, he said. For example, many companies see AI as a way to automate security and reduce headcount, he said. But once the technology is deployed, these companies realize they need to hire high-paid AI experts to effectively use the tools.\par \par \uc2 "They could take that money and put it into improving basic cybersecurity hygiene, which would do much more to protect their company," he said. Such practices include regularly patching devices and applications, constantly backing up data and educating employees on password management and phishing attacks.\par \par \uc2 M&T Bank\uc2  does not use AI for cybersecurity, Mr. Stender said. He approaches the issue as he does with any emerging technology: let other companies experiment first.\par \par \uc2 Companies should keep tabs on what large companies and government agencies do with such technologies, and learn from their mistakes, he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Adam Janofsky at adam.janofsky@wsj.com.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20180727ee7r0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The newly combined business plans to incorporate \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the Internet of Things in its business as it seeks to expand.\par \par \uc2 This week, \uc2 TriTech Software Systems\uc2 , Superion and the public sector and health-care units of \uc2 Aptean Corp\uc2 . said they would merge. The combined company would generate revenue in excess of $400 million, said its new chief executive, Simon Angove.\par \par \uc2 TriTech is backed by Bain Capital Private Equity, while Superion and \uc2 Aptean\uc2  are backed by technology-focused \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2 . Each firm brings its own set of networks and expertise to the combined company.\par \par \uc2 The new company is using data to help identify security and crime trends and cut down false alarms for first responders, said Mr. Angove, adding the business also is aiming to use Internet of Things technology to help firefighters respond to fires quickly. It also plans to leverage \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  for utility billing, as in keeping track of energy usage through smart meters and allowing customers to pay bills via Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant program, he said.\par \par \uc2 The deal is one of a number of private-equity investments involving companies offering new technologies to old-school industries to help them upgrade their business processes.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported firms increasingly have been integrating software and technological advances into companies in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-seeks-to-retool-industrial-businesses-with-technology-1530876600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=14"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 industrial machinery}}}\uc2  space. Established sectors such as industrial machinery typically don't come to mind when one thinks of cutting-edge software products, which is exactly what attracts private-equity firms.\par \par \uc2 The effort to bring new technology to established industries, some of which often lack means of collecting data or using software to guide business processes, could generate more tie-ups with private-equity firms.\par \par \uc2 Companies with more experience in industries without much technology adoption may seek partnerships with firms specializing in tech assets. Doing so presumably allows the firms and companies to capitalize on each other's knowledge and expertise.\par \par \uc2 Of course, not all of these marriages will necessarily end happily. Firms may have different opinions when it comes to exit timing or strategic direction of a business.\par \par \uc2 However, as more established industries embrace technological innovation, private-equity firms should continue to find a role as drivers of change.\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20180727ee7r00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

While it struggled with its initial approach of offering individual and Affordable Care Act plans, it later expanded to enterprise customers and said it expects to generate more than $1 billion in revenue in 2018.\par \par \uc2 Other employer-targeted startups include online benefits platform League Inc., which just raised $47.1 million by Telus Ventures and employer-sponsored health plan Centivo Corporation, which raised a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/centivo-raises-34-million-to-create-primary-care-focused-health-plan-1531908001"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $34 million }}}\uc2 led by Bain Capital Ventures.\par \par \uc2 Managing employee health care is among the most expensive parts of running a company, and it is often beset by inefficient spending on plans that ultimately aren't used.\par \par \uc2 "Even though mid-sized to large employers have the option to offer different plans, there are no single entities purpose-built to serve a self-funded health plan whose mission is around achieving total cost control," said Centivo Chief Executive Ashok Subramanian, who previously founded employee benefits marketplace \uc2 Liazon Corporation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Centivo works directly with physicians and health plans so employers can effectively create their own local, narrow health networks. With customized plans, employers are able to offer employees benefits they will actually use, such as mental health or chronic care management, and offer technology that helps with connecting services and follow-ups.\par \par \uc2 "It's a lot like what Amazon, \uc2 JP Morgan\uc2  and \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway\uc2  are trying to do - build a new type of health system by direct contracting. That's a local game, and we always talk about how health care is really local," said Bessemer Venture Partners General Partner Steve Kraus, whose firm also backed Centivo.\par \par \uc2 The cohort of employers partnering with health benefits startups builds on another trend of focusing on primary care rather than endless referrals to specialists or clinics for specific conditions, Mr. Kraus said. With the recent shift to value-based care, primary physicians have been identified as the most effective source of coordinating care, preventing health conditions, and lowering costs.\par \par \uc2 Another approach is being taken by NEA- and Flare Capital Partners-backed \uc2 Bright Health Inc\uc2 ., which contracts with health systems to create health plans for individuals and families.\par \par \uc2 But most startups are looking squarely at employers. Other than helping to create bespoke health plans, some startups aim to help employers simplify and streamline their health-care expenditures and offerings.\par \par \uc2 CollectiveHealth Inc., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurance-provider-collective-health-receives-110-million-1519885124"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 which recently raised $110 million}}}\uc2 , and \uc2 Artemis Health Inc\uc2 ., both offer employers benefits navigation and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  platforms. Former General Electric Chief Executive Jeff Immelt announced Thursday he would join CollectiveHealth's board, and in a blog post he mentioned he spent more on health-care at GE in 2009 than steel.\par \par \uc2 In today's strong labor market, employers must weigh carefully how to rein in costs while still offering benefits that will draw talent and retain employees, said Maverick Ventures Managing Partner \uc2 David Singer\uc2 . His firm has backed Centivo, CollectiveHealth and Artemis.\par \par \uc2 "With unemployment as low as it is right now, there are genuine issues with recruiting and retaining," said Mr. Singer. "Employers need to show they understand more of the overview of all of the options out there and give employees what they want."\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180727ee7r00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The company, whose "Bloom boxes" are used as back-up energy sources for data centres, was one of the stars in a portfolio assembled by venture capital firm \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Kleiner largely turned its back on the consumer internet more than a decade ago to focus on clean tech, a bet that failed when higher taxes on carbon did not materialise and many of the new technologies proved uneconomic.\par \par \uc2 "Down rounds", or fundraisings that value a company below their previous rounds, have been a stigma among private tech companies and were once rare in IPOs. They have become more common since payments company Square and online storage group Box went public at discounts of 30-50 per cent in 2015. Bloom represents a more recent phenomenon, as private tech businesses have accepted big discounts to access funding via the public market. Bloom had already raised $1.5bn in funding and $1bn of debt in its 17-year history, but still bleeds cash. It posted an operating cash outflow of $35m in the latest quarter and turned a gross profit for the first time in the final quarter of last year.\par \par \uc2 The IPO comes a month after that of Domo, another wounded "unicorn" \u8212\'20\'14 the name given to privately held startups valued at more than $1bn. The \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  software company was valued at a 85 per cent discount, and its shares have since fallen nearly 10 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Bloom priced its shares at $15, the top end of the indicated range, to raise $270m and value the company at $1.6bn. In another unusual step, it carried out a reverse share split in the days before its IPO, handing investors two shares for every three already owned to boost the nominal value of each share.\par \par \uc2 Bloom's shares opened strongly, trading up 37 per cent by lunchtime in New York.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180726ee7q0009o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

In the process, they've left traditional banks behind in the dust. For instance, \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2 's Alipay handles more than half of the country's $15.5trn online payments market, reporting half a billion active users.\par \par \uc2 In Britain, though, it's a rather different story. We've been told for a few years now that fintech start-ups such as Monzo, Revolut and Starling Bank were coming for the high street banks' lunch. But, judging by a new set of data, they haven't even got started on their breakfast.\par \par \uc2 Despite the arrival in January of Open Banking, Britain's implementation of the \u8220\'20\'1Cgame-changing\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 EU\uc2 's PSD2 directive which forced banks to share customer data -- therefore allowing challenger banks to contact customers in a bid to improve market share -- it seems UK consumers are still pretty loyal to their good old-fashioned banks. Even the ones whose IT failures have locked them out of their accounts for weeks at a time.\par \par \uc2 Mobile data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company Ogury carried out a study of just over 1.5m mobile users in the UK between April 9 and July 1 this year, and it found the top ten most-used \u8220\'20\'1Cbanking\u8221\'20\'1D apps, which include the fintech hopefuls, were all traditional high-street banks.\par \par \uc2 The top five most-used apps, measured by the share of the total visitors, were, in order, Halifax, Santander, Lloyds, \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , and NatWest. Even the technologically challenged TSB managed to hold onto about 7 per cent of the market share over the three-month period. The graph below shows the week-by-week visitor numbers (the tiny lines at the bottom are the fintechs):\par \par \uc2 Top of the fintechs is established payments unicorn \uc2 TransferWise\uc2 , with just 0.5 per cent of the visitor share in the most recent week. Revolut, which recently announced it had signed up 1 million UK users, has just 0.3 percent of the market share, while Starling Bank has 0.2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Traditional banks even dominate the new downloads list, though Starling manages to sneak into the top 10, with 4.6 per cent of downloads in the most recent week (compared with \uc2 Barclays\uc2 ' 15.7 per cent if you include its \u8220\'20\'1CPingit\u8221\'20\'1D app with its regular banking one).\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most telling piece of data is the one showing how many app users also use other banking apps.\par \par \uc2 While 67 per cent of \uc2 Bank of Scotland\uc2  users are in monogamous relationships with their banking app, only 22 per cent of users show such fidelity to the Monzo app, despite the start-up, as of October last year, offering its customers fully fledged current accounts. (And of course more than 78 per cent of those customers might have other bank accounts but might just not be using those banks' apps.) For Starling, which also offers current accounts, just 19 per cent of customers only use its app.\par \par \uc2 It should be pointed out that these numbers don't capture that many of the fintech apps, such as Monzo and Revolut, sends push-notifications as soon as a user spends money or tops up their accounts. Of course, this means customers don't go into the apps as regularly as the traditional banking apps, potentially skewing the data to favour the high street titans.\par \par \uc2 Another fly in the data ointment is the time spent on Apple Pay or Android Pay. Given tech-savvy users are likely to use their phones as payment methods once they've linked their cards, they'll have little need to check their transactions on their banking app as Apple Pay, in this example, also captures this data.\par \par \uc2 Still, UK bank executives probably aren't losing too much sleep over fintechs just yet. More likely to have them reaching for the Zopiclone are the US tech giants moving into the payments sector who -- somewhat perversely -- could end up being the biggest beneficiaries of PSD2.\par \par \uc2 Related links:\par \par \uc2 TSB customers hit by fresh IT outage - FT\par \par \uc2 Lloyds Bank\uc2  suffers payments outage - FT\par \par \uc2 Digital bank Monzo\u8217\'20\'19s losses more than quadruple - FT\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Fintech\u8217\'20\'19 threatens to eat banks\u8217\'20\'19 lunch - FT\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180725ee7p003e9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

They complain that we are misusing our rights as shareholders to enforce arbitrary political or social "values" because we raise environmental, social and governance concerns with the boards of the companies in which we invest.\par \par \uc2 This completely misrepresents the mission of \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\uc2  and other large index fund managers. We seek long-term value for millions of ordinary investors in a world that has become increasingly obsessed with short-term results. That goal, not some political agenda, is why we have developed a rigorous, research-based shareholder engagement programme. We raise all kinds of issues with boards that might materially affect their company's ability to generate sustainable returns over the long haul.\par \par \uc2 While our active funds can sell a company if we disagree with its executives, our index funds cannot choose the shares in which they invest. We are essentially permanent capital and cannot turn the S&P 500 into the S&P 499. That means we need to take a long-term perspective on behalf of our clients. At a time when some activist shareholders are keen on extracting short-term profits from companies, we provide a healthy and necessary counterweight.\par \par \uc2 Our primary fiduciary obligation to our investors is to maximise the probability of attractive long-term returns. Flows into index-based strategies have increased so dramatically over the past few years that we must take this responsibility more seriously than ever. Millions of individual investors count on the low-cost access to markets around the world provided by exchange traded funds and other trackers. This has democratised access to markets that were once available and affordable only to larger institutional investors.\par \par \uc2 We carefully select the issues we focus on with companies, based on rigorous research into their impact on investment performance. For example, numerous studies show that diversity at board level leads to better decision making, fewer reputational crises and ultimately better returns. This is the reason why we placed the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street and issued specific guidance to boards to take steps to improve diversity. Performance was our motivation, not politics.\par \par \uc2 This is just one example of how we seek to maximise transparency around our views, the research underpinning them, and our voting intentions. Others can be found in our new 2017 asset stewardship report that provides details on our proxy voting and engagement on thousands of management and shareholder proposals in 82 countries across the globe.\par \par \uc2 In addition, while we will use the data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provided by proxy advisers, we never outsource our voting decisions and we urge other institutional investors not to do so. These issues are too important to outsource and they are growing more complex.\par \par \uc2 Increasingly, our clients are pushing for more clarity on non-traditional investment issues. They want to know how companies are incorporating climate risk into their long-term strategy; whether they are adopting best practices around corporate governance, board quality and pay policies; how they are adapting to technology disruptions that could threaten their industries.\par \par \uc2 We need only look to recent corporate scandals around poor internal controls to remind us of the importance of active shareholder engagement.\par \par \uc2 Far from injecting politics into boardrooms, we believe our focus on active stewardship in a rapidly changing and complex world is more important than ever for ensuring healthy public markets, resilient economic growth and shared prosperity. We are creating longterm value; not imposing values.\par \par \uc2 The writer is president and chief executive officer of State Street Global Advisors\par \par \uc2 Diversity at board level leads to better decision making.

Cybercriminals have targeted at least a dozen companies and government agencies that had failed to install security patches or take other measures previously advised by \uc2 Oracle\uc2  or SAP, according to Reuters. "These attackers are ready to exploit years-old risks that give them the full access to SAP and \uc2 Oracle\uc2  systems without being detected," Mariano Nunez, chief executive of the security firm Onapsis Inc. told Reuters.

Mr. Bossert served in the White House until April, when current National Security Adviser John Bolton reorganized the staff, according to \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 . U.S. cybersecurity coordinator Rob Joyce also resigned. Mr. Bossert told \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  he now is concerned about "who's minding the store in the coordination and development...of new and creative cyber policies and strategies."\par \par \uc2 Cybercriminals breached same bank twice: Hackers stole more than $2.4 million from the National Bank of Blacksburg in Virginia in two breaches over eight months, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/hackers-breached-virginia-bank-twice-in-eight-months-stole-2-4m/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 KrebsOnSecurity reported}}}\uc2 . The thieves in 2016 first used a phishing email to infiltrate the bank and install malicious software on an employee's PC, KrebsOnSecurity reported. Cybercriminals in January 2017 again used a phishing attack to breach the same bank and access software that manages customer accounts, according to KrebsOnSecurity. The bank now is suing its insurance provider for failing to cover the losses.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20180725ee7p0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Their information would be \u8220\'20\'1Cde-identified\u8221\'20\'1D to safeguard individual privacy, GSK said.\par \par \uc2 Anne Wojcicki\uc2 , chief executive of \uc2 23andMe\uc2 , said: \u8220\'20\'1CThis collaboration will enable us to deliver on what many customers have been asking for \u8212\'20\'14 cures or treatments for diseases.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 To help fund the new R&D programme, GSK will carry out what \uc2 Emma Walmsley\uc2 , chief executive, called a \u8220\'20\'1Cmajor restructuring programme\u8221\'20\'1D that aims to cut costs by \u163\'00\'A3400m a year by 2021. She said the savings would be achieved through \u8220\'20\'1Csupply chain optimisation and reductions in administrative costs\u8221\'20\'1D but declined to disclose where cuts were likely.\par \par \uc2 GSK boosted its full-year earnings forecast after \u8220\'20\'1Can encouraging first half-year of trading\u8221\'20\'1D with the vaccines business performing especially well \u8212\'20\'14 Shingrix, its new shingles vaccine, is on course for \u163\'00\'A3600m-\u163\'00\'A3650m sales this year, far ahead of analysts\u8217\'20\'19 estimates.\par \par \uc2 The company now expects to post adjusted earnings per share growth of 7 per cent to 10 per cent for 2018 at constant exchange rates, assuming that \u8220\'20\'1Cno substitutable generic competitor\u8221\'20\'1D to its respiratory product Advair is introduced in the US market. It had previously forecast 4-7 per cent growth.\par \par \uc2 Ms Walmsley\u8217\'20\'19s priority is to turn round the pharmaceuticals division, which has performed relatively poorly in comparison with some other drug companies. Asked about the prospects of spinning off GSK\u8217\'20\'19s consumer division, as some investors have advocated, she said that the GSK board still favoured the current diversified structure, as long as the pharma, vaccines and consumer divisions all continued to perform well.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe board\u8217\'20\'19s position today is unchanged,\u8221\'20\'1D she said, but did not rule out a spin-off in future.\par \par \uc2 Analysts reacted enthusiastically to the \uc2 23andMe\uc2  deal and financial results. \u8220\'20\'1COverall a very positive announcement,\u8221\'20\'1D said David Cox of Panmure Gordon. \u8220\'20\'1COn top of the good numbers and the cost savings, the outlook for the future remains confident with several [products] expected to launch 2018 to 2020.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020180725ee7p003h1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Chinese real-estate investors, facing pressure from Beijing, are reversing a yearslong buying spree in the U.S. where they often paid record prices for marquee properties like New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel.\par \par \uc2 Chinese insurers, conglomerates, and other investors have turned net sellers of U.S. commercial real estate for the first time in a decade. They have spent tens of billions of dollars to acquire hotels, office buildings, and vast swaths of empty land to build residential towers.\par \par \uc2 But Chinese investors sold $1.29 billion worth of U.S. commercial real estate in the second quarter, while purchasing only $126.2 million of property, according to data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . This marked the first time these investors were net sellers for a quarter since 2008.\par \par \uc2 The more than $1 billion in net sales reflects how much the Chinese government's attitude toward investing overseas has changed in recent months.\par \par \uc2 Chinese investors began scooping up U.S. real estate a few years ago after Beijing officials loosened restrictions on foreign investment. They quickly made their mark in U.S. cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago with high-profile acquisitions -- including the $1.95 billion purchase of the Waldorf Astoria, the highest price ever paid for a U.S. hotel.\par \par \uc2 Now, the Chinese government has changed course again, cracking down on certain types of outbound investment that include real estate in part to help stabilize the currency. Chinese companies like \uc2 HNA Group\uc2  and \uc2 Greenland Holding Group\uc2  are unloading prize properties to repay debt and to comply with regulatory and market pressures from home, analysts said.\par \par \uc2 "I was shocked," said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "They really curtailed their buying and stepped up sales."\par \par \uc2 Analysts say that increasing tensions over trade and national security between China and the U.S. also have contributed to the pullback.\par \par \uc2 "The China-U.S. outbound cross-border real-estate climate has been negatively impacted by the geopolitical climate," said David Blumenfeld, a Hong Kong-based partner at \uc2 Paul Hastings LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Likely sellers include \uc2 Anbang Insurance Group\uc2 , which was taken over by Chinese regulators in February and whose chairman, \uc2 Wu Xiaohui\uc2 , was convicted of fraud and abuse of power. Anbang is considering selling some of its U.S. hotels. But it has yet to strike any deals, and has been renovating its most prized purchase, the Waldorf in New York.\par \par \uc2 "The company is still in the process of reviewing overseas assets," said Shen Gang, an Anbang spokesman. "We currently do not have specific asset optimization plan, nor a specific timetable."\par \par \uc2 The retreat by Chinese investors could slow growth further in the U.S. commercial real-estate market. Property values have plateaued on average in the past 18 months after rising sharply in the early years of the post-2008 financial crisis recovery.\par \par \uc2 While Chinese buyers never represented more than a fraction of the buying power in any U.S. market, these companies often made headlines with the steep prices they were willing to pay, which helped push values higher in certain segments of the market.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, China's Sunshine Insurance Group bought the Baccarat Hotel in midtown Manhattan for around $230 million, a price that valued the luxury property at about $2 million a room. That was one of the highest valuations ever for a hotel by the popular industry metric.\par \par \uc2 Chinese investors had their own reasons for paying top dollar. Some of the executives running these firms felt that controlling trophy properties conferred prestige on their owners and built their brand recognition for future expansion, analysts say. A number of Chinese investors also planned to hold these properties for several decades, so they weren't worried about prices falling in major markets like New York, the analysts add.\par \par \uc2 For many Chinese firms, that long-term timetable has been scraped after the government began pressuring companies to reduce their debt levels and to cut credit risk in the banking sector.\par \par \uc2 Not every Chinese investor is under pressure to sell. Developers of smaller residential projects and insurers that own warehouses and senior living centers aren't in retreat, lawyers for these developers say.\par \par \uc2 And even for Chinese companies that face this pressure, some have been able to sell at a profit. The government has allowed investors to start by selling properties that have increased in value to avoid losing face, according to Chinese investors.\par \par \uc2 For example, this year \uc2 HNA Group\uc2  and a partner sold 1180 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan to Northwood Investors for around $305 million, according to data from \uc2 CoStar Group\uc2 . The conglomerate, which has its headquarters in Haikou, a city in southern China's Hainan province, bought a 90% stake in the office tower for $259 million in 2011.\par \par \uc2 HNA Group\uc2  also has recently sold a stake in 245 Park Avenue to \uc2 SL Green Realty Corp\uc2 , and SL Green will have operating control of the building. HNA bought the tower for $2.2 billion last year.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 HNA Group\uc2  has long said it will be disciplined and thoughtful about its asset dispositions as it realigns its strategy," a spokesman of HNA said. Late last year, \uc2 HNA Group\uc2  earmarked roughly $6 billion worth of properties for sale, according to a person close to the matter.\par \par \uc2 Chinese lenders also want to avoid the painful repercussions that losses would cause.\par \par \uc2 "If there is a fire sale, the banks also lose," said Edward Tse, chief executive of Gao Feng Advisory Co., a Shanghai-based consulting firm.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw509\pich480\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7635\pichgoal7200

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Stock market investors are awaiting one of the real-estate industry's most closely watched initial public offerings in years, setting up what could be a Wall Street referendum on the current economic expansion.\par \par \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield\uc2 , a global brokerage and real-estate-services firm that reported $6.92 billion in 2017 revenue, is hoping to sell $719 million to $931 million in shares in an IPO that would value the firm at roughly $6 billion including debt, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cushman-wakefield-sets-ipo-price-between-16-and-18-1532362497"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pricing documents announced Monday}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Trading is expected to begin in early August on the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2  after a roadshow in which backers of the offering will discuss Cushman with potential investors, the firm said.\par \par \uc2 The real-estate business is closely aligned with the health of the broader economy, and the success or failure of Cushman's IPO will reflect in part whether investors believe economic growth in many parts of the world will continue.\par \par \uc2 Like \uc2 CBRE Group Inc\uc2 ., JLL, and other publicly traded real-estate firms, Cushman is highly dependent on sales and leasing brokerage commissions. These balloon when companies are expanding and real-estate investors are gobbling up office buildings, hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial property.\par \par \uc2 But these revenues crater when economies contract. For example, CBRE reported $4.2 billion in 2009, the year after the stock market crash, down from $5.1 billion in 2008 and $6 billion in 2007.\par \par \uc2 Global brokerage firms have been trying to insulate themselves from this volatility by building up businesses with steadier revenue like property management. Such "recurring" revenue represented 47% of Cushman's total in 2017, according to papers the firm filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.\par \par \uc2 Still, the brokerage business draws the biggest profits from its more economically sensitive businesses, rather than those generating steady recurring revenue.\par \par \uc2 "Commercial real estate will continue to be a cyclical industry," said Louise Keeling, portfolio manager at RWC Partners Ltd., in an email. The London- based asset manager with about $15.5 billion in assets under management owns shares in CBRE and \uc2 Savills PLC\uc2 , a London-based real-estate services firm.\par \par \uc2 Real-estate bulls believe the current economic expansion may have years to run. They point out that shares of CBRE and JLL, the world's largest and second-largest commercial real-estate firms respectively, are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cushman-is-expected-to-set-ipo-pricing-1532094284"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 trading near record highs}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I think we're in for an extended cycle," said Ross Smotrich, an analyst with \uc2 Barclays\uc2  who follows CBRE and JLL.\par \par \uc2 But Wall Street bears point to signs that the strong rebound of commercial real-estate values that began shortly after the last recession ended is running out of steam. Values of properties owned by U.S. real-estate investment trusts have plateaued over the past 18 months, although some sectors, like industrial property, are doing better than others.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, rising interest rates have increased the likelihood that capital will increasingly shift from commercial real estate to the bond market, driving down property values. These concerns already have sent tremors through the real-estate investment trust sector causing it to underperform the broader stock market since the beginning of 2016.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, many thought the investment group led by private-equity firm TPG that acquired Cushman in 2015 made its bet on commercial real estate too late in the cycle. Their fears seemed to be borne out in 2016, when rising interest rates and other economic concerns caused shares of CBRE and JLL to fall.\par \par \uc2 Some of those worries eased last year. Property values in most markets didn't suffer the decline many feared, and the brokerage business strengthened as companies in Europe and the U.S. expanded. CBRE's revenue in 2017 was $14.2 billion, up from $13.1 billion in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Last year's tax overhaul, which many analysts believe will help extend the U.S. expansion, also boosted the commercial real-estate business. Continued appetite for commercial property by cross-border investors has also helped make up for concern about interest rate increases. Sales globally increased 15% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the first quarter of 2017, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The commercial real-estate market is proving more resilient than investors had been expecting," said Jade Rahmani, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "If you would have told me the Fed is on track to raise rates four times this year on top of the rate rises we had last year and it's not going to impact the transaction market, I would have said, 'you're kidding me.'"\par \par \uc2 The macroeconomic outlook isn't the only possible concern that could cause the Cushman IPO to be a dud. The firm also has more and lower profit margins debt than many of its peers. The firm recorded net losses of $221 million and $92 million in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 respectively partly because of spending on integrating the three firms.\par \par \uc2 But if investor appetite is strong, it would\u8203\'20\'0Bbe a good outcome for the TPG group, which wrote an equity check for Cushman and the two other firms of about $500 million, according to a person familiar with the deal. With a $6 billion valuation, TPG is poised to double its equity investment as that stake would be would with just over $1 billion, at least on paper, the person said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Peter Grant at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:peter.grant@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 peter.grant@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Maureen Farrell at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:maureen.farrell@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 maureen.farrell@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180724ee7o001p5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The fund held a $110 million initial closing in March 2017, said a Credit Suisse spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 The vehicle, NEXT Investors II LP, collected money predominantly from outside limited partners, said Greg Grimaldi, a partner who co-leads NEXT.\par \par \uc2 The second vehicle is the first in which \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  isn't an investor, although the fund works with the bank on a number of areas, including sourcing deal flow.\par \par \uc2 The fund is a vote of confidence by institutional LPs for the team to continue its investment activities in the financial-services industry. Alan Freudenstein and Mr. Grimaldi began investing in the space at \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  in 2000, investing from the bank's balance sheet until 2013. In 2014, NEXT secured $404 million in total commitments for its first fund, including $135 million in new investments and the $269 million purchase of a portfolio that \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  transferred to the firm.\par \par \uc2 The fund invests in companies in areas such as financial technology, enterprise software, data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and specialty finance.\par \par \uc2 The NEXT team so far has deployed $498 million in 71 investments, according to a news release. The firm last year made a $6 million Series A investment in LUX Fund Technology & Solutions Inc., which provides technology to alternative asset managers. That investment was made out of NEXT's second fund, Mr. Freudenstein said.\par \par \uc2 NEXT generally invests $10 million to $15 million in equity per deal. This strategy is similar to that of the firm's previous fund, said Mr. Freudenstein, who added NEXT's strategy for investing in the space hasn't changed in the roughly 18 years the two men have been investing together.\par \par \uc2 The growth-focused vehicle invests in companies that "are at or near cash-flow positive and need additional cash flow to grow," Mr. Freudenstein said. The latest fund, which has a five-year investment period, is expected to make about 20 investments, he added.\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20180724ee7o000b6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 HONG KONG\u8212\'20\'14China's Tencent Holdings Ltd. has struck a deal to provide \uc2 WebMD\uc2 's health-care content to the more than 1 billion users on its \uc2 WeChat\uc2  social network, according to both companies.\par \par \uc2 The content-licensing deal includes \uc2 WebMD\uc2  articles, videos and slideshows covering medical and health topics, such as the side effects of chemotherapy or the symptoms of appendicitis. Financial terms weren't disclosed.\par \par \uc2 WebMD\uc2 , which is owned by private-equity firm \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . and based in New York, said the deal will raise the quality of health-care information available to Chinese consumers. The content, slated to be rolled out by year's end, will also be available on Tencent's QQ messaging app.\par \par \uc2 "There are tens of millions of people on \uc2 WeChat\uc2  today that are forming groups for specific disease information, whether it's cancer or diabetes," said Jeremy Schneider, senior vice president of corporate development and global strategy for WebMD. "There is a lot of talking amongst themselves, but there is not a lot of credible information."\par \par \uc2 Tencent will translate and adapt the content for Chinese audiences, as well as focus on diseases that are more prevalent in China, such as lung cancer, Meng Zhang, general manager of Tencent Healthcare Information Center, wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 "There are quite some differences between Chinese and Western demographics, medical practices and cultures," Mr. Zhang wrote. "It is very important that we take into account these differences during the localization process."\par \par \uc2 Health care is a big\u8212\'20\'14and growing\u8212\'20\'14business in China, which is forecast to spend $1 trillion on health care by 2020, according to a report from \uc2 McKinsey & Co\uc2 . Its aging population is increasingly dealing with chronic conditions such as diabetes, but the health-care system doesn't have enough general family doctors who can direct patients to the right treatments and specialists, said Philip Leung, head of the Greater China Healthcare practice for consulting firm \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That leaves many people turning up at the hospital for care. Wait times can be so extreme that ticket scalpers book hospital appointments and then try to sell them for a big markup, a practice Beijing has started cracking down on, said Mark Natkin, managing director of research firm Marbridge Consulting.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, China has expanded insurance coverage, encouraged the growth of private hospitals and pushed for digitizing medical records. To further improve care, China last year tapped Tencent to be a "national champion" to develop uses of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology in medicine.\par \par \uc2 Tencent has backed dozens of health-care companies both in China and around the world. Mr. Natkin said his firm has tracked at least 30 health-care-related investments since April 2012, and said there are probably more. Tencent declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The new \uc2 WebMD\uc2  services will compete against a growing number of companies providing not only medical information but also online tools that help Chinese consumers navigate the system.\par \par \uc2 On WeDoctor, for example, users can consult doctors and book appointments online. The startup is backed by Tencent and slated to go public in Hong Kong later this year. \uc2 Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co\uc2 ., which also provides online diagnosis and doctor-booking services, went public in May.\par \par \uc2 Fanfan Wang in Beijing contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180724ee7o00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Phil Gramm and Mike Solon's "Keep Politics Out of the Boardroom" (op-ed, July 19) criticizing the role of large index managers misrepresents \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\uc2 ' core investment mission. We engage with companies not to force arbitrary political or social "values" on them, but rather to promote long-term value for millions of investors saving for the future in a world that has become increasingly obsessed with the short term. Unlike our active strategies, where we can sell a company when we disagree with management, in our index-based strategies we represent quasi-permanent capital. Our fiduciary obligation is to maximize the probability of attractive long-term returns for those who invest with us.\par \par \uc2 We have created a strategic engagement program that raises material issues with boards, including ESG concerns that might impact companies' ability to generate sustainable returns. We carefully select the issues, based on rigorous research identifying their materiality for investment performance. We seek maximum transparency around our views, the research underpinning them and our voting intentions through our thought leadership and conversations with both boards and our clients, who are demanding greater clarity around these issues.\par \par \uc2 While we will use the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provided by proxy advisers, we never outsource our proxy voting decisions. Far from injecting politics into boardrooms, we believe our focus on active stewardship and long-term value in a rapidly changing world is more important than ever for ensuring healthy public markets, resilient economic growth and shared prosperity. This is the future of long-term investing.\par \par \uc2 Cyrus Taraporevala\par \par \uc2 President and CEO\par \par \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\par \par \uc2 Boston\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  has developed something called an Investment Stewardship program. The program brochure goes to great lengths to highlight \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 's advocacy for trendy issues such as board gender targets, board diversity targets, sustainability reporting and climate risks. Traditional concerns, such as executive pay, board experience, conflicts of interest and unequal voting-share classes, are included but not highlighted.\par \par \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  seems to be seeking to immunize itself against curious regulators and others looking at legal issues surrounding its proxy voting by signing up with nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations to allow it to prominently display their logos.\par \par \uc2 All the \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  material reminds me of an article in Foreign Policy from Feb. 21 of last year: "Saving the World, One Meaningless Buzzword at a Time," about how the corporate world has turned human rights into a theater of meaningless programs, conventions, meetings and training courses.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Weeks\par \par \uc2 Houston\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180724000004"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180724ee7o00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 The senior partner of a law firm asks colleagues a simple question to assess the health of the organisation's culture: "Why do you stay?" There is a twist, he told me. They should not answer when they are in the flow of an exciting case, basking in the prestige and pay of their position, or looking forward to a sunny weekend surrounded by their admiring family. Instead, they should recall their worst day \u8212\'20\'14 when a senior colleague had bawled them out, say, the workload seemed unmanageable, and they arrived home in a rainstorm, too late to kiss the children good night. Why did they stay on that day? For all the emphasis on scientific gauges of culture, powered by \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  or \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , this seems a good way of probing for organisational strengths and weaknesses. Last week, in a farewell note to staff at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , outgoing chief executive \uc2 Lloyd Blankfein\uc2  half-answered the question: "When times are tougher, you can't leave," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 "And, when times are better, you don't want to leave."\par \par \uc2 How corporate cultures rise and fall is on my mind because I recently watched The Lehman Trilogy, \uc2 Ben Power\uc2 's adaptation of Stefano Massini's epic saga about the bank, in a new production at London's National Theatre. At the same time, the UK's Financial Reporting Council has published its revised governance code, in which it urges boards to "assess and monitor culture".\par \par \uc2 The regulator guides directors towards the features of good culture, including honesty, openness, respect and a sense of shared purpose. It sets these against symptoms of sickness: a dominant chief executive, pressure to meet overambitious targets, and low levels of meaningful engagement between leadership and staff. Exactly the sort of faults that were laid at the door of Lehman's last chief executive, the self-deluded Dick Fuld.\par \par \uc2 It is no plot spoiler to mention that The Lehman Trilogy, like Lehman itself, ends with Mr Fuld. In fact, the bank's tumultuous collapse in 2008 merits only 10 minutes of the three-hour show. Most of the play describes the values, influence, and trajectory of the three original Lehman brothers and their descendants over a century and a half. With forgivable simplification, it lays the blame for Lehman's eventual demise in part on how American capitalism distanced itself from real products such as those that the three brothers bought and sold in Alabama in the mid-19th century \u8212\'20\'14 textiles, cotton, coffee. The production suggests another, and more important, factor was the firm's catastrophic cultural decay.\par \par \uc2 The final decline starts in the 1970s and 1980s, when stewardship of the bank passes from the family to traders such as the repulsive Lew Glucksman (who used to wield a small axe in the office) and his prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 Mr Fuld.\par \par \uc2 In the London production, the contrast is brought out by the fact that the actors portraying the brothers also play every other character. Even at the moment of bankruptcy, the darkest episode of the financial crisis, the trio are a visible onstage reminder, in their black frock coats and stiff collars, of the bank's entrepreneurial origins and its pioneering early success.\par \par \uc2 Of course, Lehman needed to evolve to survive, as did \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 . Culturally, the firms were once not so far apart. Indeed, at the beginning of the last century, second generation scions of the founding German-Jewish families prospered through partnering on deals, such as taking retailer Sears Roebuck public.\par \par \uc2 But Lehman failed to heed the advice now offered by the UK regulator: to monitor and control its poisonous subcultures, the "hotspots and outliers [that] can alert the board to a possible problem".\par \par \uc2 Like Glucksman and Mr Fuld, Mr Blankfein was a trader. But, whatever you think of Goldman as an organisation, he proved able to assimilate the culture of investment banking and hold the bank together through the financial crisis. His successor, \uc2 David Solomon\uc2 , is an investment banker (albeit one with a sideline in DJ-ing) who will have to achieve the reverse cultural trick.\par \par \uc2 Another FRC culture tip is to conduct exit interviews with people who quit. It is a step that companies often skip or rush. Mr Blankfein's farewell note hints at a useful alternative. After a time, ask alumni what they miss most and least about the organisation.\par \par \uc2 Mr Blankfein forecasts he will miss Goldman's people. It is a predictable response, but analogous to the reply the law firm partner hears most often when he asks colleagues why they stay: we wouldn't want to let our mates down. There is one snag in using this as the ultimate test of good culture: many Lehman staff would have said the same 10 years ago, the day before the bank imploded. As Henry, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman knew, a rotten culture at the top infects the whole.\par \par \uc2 andrew.hill@ft.com Twitter: @andrewtghill\par \par \uc2 ' The advice is to monitor subcultures, the 'hotspots and outliers [that] can alert the board to a possible problem' '\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180723ee7n00099\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Schemes are just one example of market manipulation in loosely-regulated crypto land\par \par \uc2 Spend five minutes browsing cryptocurrency content on Telegram, the encrypted messaging app, and you\u8217\'20\'19ll soon discover dozens of \u8216\'20\'18pump and dump\u8217\'20\'19 scams orchestrated with a brazenness that makes the Wolf of Wall Street look like a pussy cat.\par \par \uc2 The threads typically urge speculators to pile into one chosen cryptocurrency at a certain time, inflating the price. This sucks in other unwitting punters, driving the price up higher still, and at some point, the pumpers become dumpers and cash out rapidly.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe guarantee you the x2 if everyone buys and promotes the coin. Never panic sell, trust us and we will take you to the moon,\u8221\'20\'1D one group called Crypto VIP Signals promises its 50,000 subscribers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBuy the f***ing dip! Make this pump great again!\u8221\'20\'1D another instructs its 25,000-strong community, without mincing its words.\par \par \uc2 Pump and dump schemes are just one example of market manipulation that is thought to be rife in loosely-regulated crypto land. Others include front-running, wash trading, which involves creating false volume by matching trades, and spoofing, where you place and then quickly cancel orders.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C[The market] is highly, highly, highly manipulated. The extent is truly humongous,\u8221\'20\'1D says Asaf Meir, a former software engineer at Goldman Sachs who has launched a startup called Solidus Labs to develop market surveillance tools specifically for crypto markets.\par \par \uc2 It's responding to demand, he says, as crypto firms realise that market manipulation is as big a worry for risk and compliance teams as money-laundering.\par \par \uc2 In many cases, dodgy behaviour can be facilitated by collusion over social media and messaging apps. In addition, crypto assets are held via electronic identities that in many cases allow traders to remain anonymous.\par \par \uc2 It is hard to get a precise sense of the scale of the problem as there is little data is available. Still, regulators\u8217\'20\'19 ears have pricked up.\par \par \uc2 Last week, the \uc2 Financial Stability Board\uc2 , the group of policymakers and regulators that makes recommendations to the G20,\u160\'00\'A0 said \u160\'00\'A0some crypto data on prices, trading volumes and volatility was unreliable due to manipulation.\par \par \uc2 Across the pond, the \uc2 US Department of Justice\uc2  and the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  have announced\u160\'00\'A0 a criminal investigation \u160\'00\'A0into possible cryptocurrency manipulation, and requested trading data from some large exchanges. It comes after several traditional US exchanges last year launched\u160\'00\'A0 bitcoin futures, products that unlike the biggest cryptocurrency itself are directly regulated by US authorities.\par \par \uc2 The CFTC has even promised whistleblowers on pump-and-dump schemes that lead to \u8220\'20\'1Cmonetary sanctions of $1m or more\u8221\'20\'1D that they might be rewarded with between 10 and 30 per cent of the penalties. It\u8217\'20\'19s little surprise then that crypto market surveillance is gaining traction.\par \par \uc2 Mr Meir of Solidus Labs says his firm is working on developing a product for market makers, hedge funds and brokerages. Meanwhile, a wave of cryptocurrency exchanges have also announced they are taking action.\par \par \uc2 Gemini, run by the Winklevoss twins of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  fame, said in April that it would use \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s surveillance technology called Smarts.\par \par \uc2 Last week, UK exchange \uc2 Coinfloor\uc2  followed in the footsteps of US exchange \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  when it launched a partnership with Chicago\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Trading Technologies\uc2 , a market surveillance company that has long offered its products to the traditional derivatives trading marketplace.\par \par \uc2 Obi Nwosu, \uc2 Coinfloor\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s chief executive, tells FintechFT that without moves to stamp out crypto manipulation, \u8220\'20\'1Cyou will eventually have a market which is not functioning well and it will end up like a \u8217\'20\'19tragedy of the commons\u8217\'20\'19 scenario\u8230\'20\'26damaging the market and potentially destroying it\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 But others are less open to the idea. In a snappish\u160\'00\'A0blog post, top 30 exchange Kraken said that being protected from market manipulation \u8220\'20\'1Cdoesn\u8217\'20\'19t matter\u8221\'20\'1D to most crypto traders.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s fair to say there\u8217\'20\'19s a split,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Nwosu explains. \u8220\'20\'1CIf you\u8217\'20\'19re quite short term in your focus you might not care about putting systems in place - unlike those with a long term view.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Further fintech fascination\par \par \uc2 Millennials and their money\u160\'00\'A0The mobile payments revolution in China has happened with breathtaking speed and scale. In only five years it has transformed daily life in Chinese cities and also laid the foundations for the country\u8217\'20\'19s mammoth financial tech industry, which last year generated revenues of Rmb654bn ($98bn), according to iResearch. Last year, the value of mobile payments in China overtook the worldwide totals of both \uc2 Visa\uc2  and \uc2 Mastercard\uc2 . Almost half the world\u8217\'20\'19s digital payments in 2017 were made in China, through apps such as Alipay and \uc2 WeChat\uc2 , according to PwC research.\u160\'00\'A0This transformation has been spearheaded by millennials, who were the early adopters of mobile payments, but it has rapidly spread across generations.

The government says that by 2020, it wants to have a national video surveillance network that is \u8220\'20\'1Comnipresent, fully networked, always working and fully controllable\u8221\'20\'1D. AI technologies have already allowed Chinese companies to give consumers a social credit score, conferring wider benefits on those with high scores and penalising those with low ones. But there is concern it could be used for more sinister purposes - such as spying on political dissidents and persecuted minorities.\par \par \uc2 Default-to-default\u160\'00\'A0A wave of\u160\'00\'A0 defaults \u160\'00\'A0has hit China\u8217\'20\'19s $190bn peer-to-peer lending industry this year, as Beijing cracks down on debt and financial risk in the shadow-banking sector. About 150 online lending platforms have suffered \u8220\'20\'1Cproblems\u8221\'20\'1D since the beginning of June this year, data show, meaning investors have been unable to take out money, owners have run away or police have launched an investigation into a platform.\par \par \uc2 Fintech\u160\'00\'A0views in the\u160\'00\'A0FT\u160\'00\'A0banking podcast\par \par \uc2 Bits and bobs\par \par \uc2 Compliance crunch\u160\'00\'A0Revolut has reported\u160\'00\'A0 suspected money laundering \u160\'00\'A0on its digital payments system to the UK\u8217\'20\'19s law enforcement authorities and financial regulator.

Banks' most elaborate modelling efforts to date have been focused on their trading rooms. Mr Lyon says Simudyne's software enables them to recreate the factors underlying an entire financial marketplace. "The most interesting things that can happen \u8212\'20\'14 the collapse of a bank, the spread of contagion \u8212\'20\'14 are the result of multiple factors that aggregate towards a tipping point."\par \par \uc2 For lending, Simudyne's software allows banks to build simulations based on inputs such as household incomes, how people spend their money and how they behave as borrowers.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180723ee7n0006m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 . is paying $2.6 billion in cash to prove it is serious about its transformation from sleepy custodian to tech-savvy data manager.\par \par \uc2 The Boston bank said Friday it agreed to buy financial-data firm \uc2 Charles River Systems Inc\uc2 . The decision is its boldest move yet to step out of its financial-services clients' back offices and onto their trading floors, where \uc2 State Street\uc2  can offer data, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and trading tools to investment staff.\par \par \uc2 "Our overall strategy even before we started talking to Charles River has been about data, and about this idea that information delivered in an appropriate way and in a usable way is the most powerful tool we can provide to market," State Street President \uc2 Ron O'Hanley\uc2  said on a conference call with analysts.\par \par \uc2 Some investors said they were concerned \uc2 State Street\uc2  is paying too much and were skeptical the company would be able to meet all of the revenue targets laid out in the deal.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2 's shares fell 7.4% Friday, their biggest one-day drop in more than two years. The stock closed at $85.87, down $6.87.\par \par \uc2 To help pay for the acquisition, \uc2 State Street\uc2  canceled plans to buy back about $950 million in company stock this year. The acquisition's price of $2.6 billion is nearly nine times Charles River's revenue in 2017.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  also reported quarterly results that fell short of some analysts' expectations.\par \par \uc2 "There's definitely some strategic sense to it," Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Evercore ISI, said of the Charles River deal. "Execution-wise, it will take time and will be hard to do."\par \par \uc2 Charles River, a closely held firm based in Burlington, Mass., runs a software platform used by more than 300 investment firms, wealth managers and other financial-services companies -- many of which overlap with \uc2 State Street\uc2 's client list. It has 745 employees and tallied revenue of more than $300 million last year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. O'Hanley said Charles River's founder and chief executive, Peter Lambertus, owns nearly all of his company's equity. He will serve in a consulting role as \uc2 State Street\uc2  completes the acquisition.\par \par \uc2 The bank will appoint a new CEO to run Charles River, which will be a stand-alone division within \uc2 State Street\uc2 . The bank expects the deal will begin to add to its earnings in 2020.\par \par \uc2 The deal comes as \uc2 State Street\uc2  and other custody banks look to pull out of a yearslong rut of low revenue growth as financial-services firms push to lower the fees they pay for custody and accounting. The industry's biggest players, including \uc2 State Street\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon Corp\uc2 ., have slashed expenses in a bid to lift earnings.\par \par \uc2 But investors want them to boost revenue, too. Those firms are betting technology, and the sweeping digitization of financial markets, will emerge as a panacea of sorts -- allowing them to automate functions and lower costs, but also giving them the tools to harness the reams of data they collect from clients as custodian to trillions of dollars in assets.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2 , which performs core administrative and accounting tasks for 86 of the world's largest 100 money managers, has been steadily adding to its own data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  offerings. The bank estimates there is an $8 billion market for those tools. \uc2 Bloomberg LP\uc2  and \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 .'s Aladdin unit are among Charles River's biggest rivals.\par \par \uc2 The Charles River agreement is also the latest bid by Mr. O'Hanley to lean on acquisitions to speed up \uc2 State Street\uc2 's transformation. As head of the firm's asset-management business, he had championed \uc2 State Street\uc2 's 2016 purchase of \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 .'s investments division.\par \par \uc2 Mr. O'Hanley did a series of deals as president of BNY Mellon's asset-management arm, and joined \uc2 State Street\uc2  in 2015 after a four-year stint at \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2 . He is slated to succeed \uc2 Joseph Hooley\uc2  as the bank's chief executive at the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  announced the Charles River agreement minutes before it reported second-quarter net income of $698 million, or $1.88 a share. The profit figure marked a 20% increase from a year earlier, when the firm earned $584 million, or $1.53 a share.\par \par \uc2 Total revenue rose 7.7% to $3.03 billion.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich508\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal7620

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 . is paying nearly $3 billion in cash to prove it is serious about its transformation from sleepy custodian to tech-savvy data manager.\par \par \uc2 The Boston bank said Friday it had agreed to buy financial-data firm \uc2 Charles River Systems Inc\uc2 . The decision is its boldest move yet to step out of its financial-services clients' back offices and onto their trading floors, where \uc2 State Street\uc2  can offer data, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and trading tools to investment staff.\par \par \uc2 "Our overall strategy even before we started talking to Charles River has been about data, and about this idea that information delivered in an appropriate way and in a usable way is the most powerful tool we can provide to market," State Street President \uc2 Ron O'Hanley\uc2  said on a conference call with analysts.\par \par \uc2 Reacting to the agreement, some investors said they were concerned \uc2 State Street\uc2  is paying too much, and skeptical the company would be able to meet all of the revenue targets laid out in the deal.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2 's shares fell 7.4% on Friday, their biggest one-day drop in more than two years. The stock closed at $85.87, down $6.87.\par \par \uc2 To help pay for the acquisition, \uc2 State Street\uc2  canceled plans to buy back about $950 million in company stock this year. The firm will spend $2.6 billion on the acquisition\u8212\'20\'14nearly nine times Charles River's revenue in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Boston-based \uc2 State Street\uc2  also reported quarterly results that fell short of some analysts' expectations.\par \par \uc2 "There's definitely some strategic sense to it," Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Evercore ISI, said of the Charles River deal. "Execution-wise, it will take time and will be hard to do."\par \par \uc2 Charles River, a closely held firm based in Burlington, Mass., runs a software platform used by more than 300 investment firms, wealth managers and other financial-services companies\u8212\'20\'14many of which overlap with \uc2 State Street\uc2 's client list. It has 745 employees and tallied revenue of more than $300 million last year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. O'Hanley said Charles River's founder and chief executive, Peter Lambertus, owns nearly all of his company's equity. He will serve in a consulting role as \uc2 State Street\uc2  completes the acquisition.\par \par \uc2 The bank will appoint a new CEO to run Charles River, which will be a stand-alone division within \uc2 State Street\uc2 . The bank expects the deal will begin to add to its earnings in 2020.\par \par \uc2 The deal comes as \uc2 State Street\uc2  and other custody banks look to pull out of a yearslong rut of low revenue growth as financial-services firms push to lower the fees they pay for custody and accounting. The industry's biggest players, including \uc2 State Street\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon Corp\uc2 ., have slashed expenses in a bid to lift earnings.\par \par \uc2 But investors want them to boost revenue, too. Those firms are betting technology, and the sweeping digitization of financial markets, will emerge as a panacea, of sorts\u8212\'20\'14allowing them to automate functions and lower costs, but also giving them the tools to harness the reams of data they collect from clients as custodian to trillions of dollars in assets.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2 , which performs core administrative and accounting tasks for 86 of the world's largest 100 money managers, has been steadily adding to its own data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  offerings. The bank estimates there is an $8 billion market for those tools. \uc2 Bloomberg LP\uc2  and \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 .'s Aladdin unit are among Charles River's biggest rivals.\par \par \uc2 The Charles River agreement is also the latest bid by Mr. O'Hanley to lean on acquisitions to speed up \uc2 State Street\uc2 's transformation. As head of the firm's asset-management business, he had championed \uc2 State Street\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-street-to-acquire-ge-asset-management-1459337436"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 2016 purchase}}}\uc2  of \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 .'s investments division.\par \par \uc2 Mr. O'Hanley did a series of deals as president of BNY Mellon's asset-management arm, and joined \uc2 State Street\uc2  in 2015 after a four-year stint at \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2 . He is slated to succeed \uc2 Joseph Hooley{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-street-ceo-to-retire-next-year-1510064577"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 as the bank's chief executive }}}\uc2 at the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  announced the Charles River agreement minutes before it reported second-quarter net income of $698 million, or $1.88 a share. The profit figure marked a 20% increase from a year earlier, when the firm earned $584 million, or $1.53 a share.\par \par \uc2 Included in the latest results was a $77 million charge, or 17 cents a share, related to job cuts and management changes related to its continuing push to automate functions and eliminate expenses.\par \par \uc2 Excluding the charge, \uc2 State Street\uc2  earned $2.05 a share. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence had expected a per-share profit of $2.01.\par \par \uc2 Total revenue rose 7.7% to $3.03 billion.\par \par \uc2 Write to Justin Baer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:justin.baer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 justin.baer@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/etf-fees-tumble-as-price-war-heats-up-among-big-fund-firms-1531396800"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Investors Win From ETF Price War}}}\uc2  (July 12)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-stress-tests-deutsche-bank-fails-goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-are-limited-on-payouts-1530217924"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dinged in Fed Stress Tests}}}\uc2  (June 28)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fearless-girl-to-stare-down-stock-exchange-not-bull-by-year-end-1524174078"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 'Fearless Girl' Will Move to New York Stock Exchange\u8212\'20\'14No Bull}}}\uc2  (April 19)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-surprisingly-large-winners-in-a-bill-to-help-small-banks-1521019801"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Surprisingly Large Winners in a Bill to Help Small Banks}}}\uc2  (March 14)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/custody-banks-arent-flashy-but-their-shares-are-1516821845"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Custody Banks Aren't Flashy, but Their Shares Are}}}\uc2  (Jan. 24)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-blackrock-vanguard-and-state-street-engagement-has-different-meanings-1516449600"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 At BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, 'Engagement' Has Different Meanings}}}\uc2  (Jan. 20)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-gender-diversity-etf-could-be-well-timed-1512356460"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A Gender-Diversity ETF Could Be Well-Timed}}}\uc2  (Dec. 3)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180720ee7k0015p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

But that doesn't mean that growth-equity and private-equity firms aren't getting in on the act as well, albeit for different reasons.\par \par \uc2 An increasing number of private-equity investors are leveraging AI and other technology products as a way to help them make the best deals.\par \par \uc2 It is no secret growth-equity and private-equity firms often compete for the same deals and court many of the same companies. Hoping to rely less on associates cold calling companies early on to establish relationships, private-equity shops have looked to software to expedite the process and find the best matches.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco-based Enter Capital has created its own proprietary in-house software platform the firm uses to track potential deals that fit its investment thesis. The software, known as Ivy, helps the firm manage its deal flow and generate leads for potential target companies.\par \par \uc2 Enter Capital began to work on the product\u8212\'20\'14designed to cut cold calling out of the equation for private investors\u8212\'20\'1412 to 14 months ago and rolled the product out six months ago, said William Duran, a director at the firm.\par \par \uc2 "It does the same thing a person would do\u8212\'20\'14going through LinkedIn and looking for companies," he said, adding the software also grabs data from social media profiles as well as from business-information platform Crunchbase. The data, he said, enables the software to narrow down a list of companies that best fit the firm's investment profile, rather than through the laborious work of reaching out directly by phone in hopes of a match.\par \par \uc2 The firm also provides the deal sourcing software as a service to 11 other firms that invest in sectors it doesn't back. According to Mr. Duran, firms that use its software platform learned about the product through word-of-mouth.\par \par \uc2 Technology-focused Insight Venture Partners is another firm that has leveraged \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to help source deals.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc92}{\*\bkmkend toc92}\b \uc2 U.S. News: Homeowners Are Underinsured as Hurricane Season Unfolds\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nicole Friedman and Leslie Scism \par \uc2 642 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 July 2018\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Many U.S. homeowners are inadequately insured for natural-catastrophe damage ahead of the height of the Atlantic hurricane season.\par \par \uc2 Three major landfalling hurricanes in 2017 -- Harvey, Irma and Maria -- revealed a widespread lack of full insurance coverage for homeowners in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Those storms served as a wake-up call to some, but the underinsurance of Americans persists, according to regulators, trade groups and government data.\par \par \uc2 While most people have home insurance, many lack flood insurance, which is typically purchased from the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  as a separate policy. Many homeowners also have home-insurance policy limits that are too low to cover the full cost of repairing or rebuilding their properties.\par \par \uc2 "Many people thought that they had a fully insured home or fully insured business" before last year's catastrophes, said Iraelia Pernas, executive director of Acodese, an industry group for insurers in Puerto Rico. "They discovered that there were some exclusions in their policies."\par \par \uc2 Javier Rivera Rios, the territory's insurance commissioner, said a lot of the houses in Puerto Rico that suffered losses weren't insured at all, let alone with flood coverage.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Gundling of Friendswood, Texas, didn't have flood insurance when his home filled with two feet of water during Harvey. His home insurance covered some wind damage to the house, but Mr. Gundling took out a loan to pay for most repairs.\par \par \uc2 When he decided to forgo flood insurance, he felt it was the right call based on recommendations from his real-estate and insurance agents.\par \par \uc2 "It was disheartening . . . to find out that I was severely underinsured," Mr. Gundling said.\par \par \uc2 After the storm, he bought insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program and expanded his home-insurance coverage. The federal policies pay up to $250,000 for damage to a residence and $100,000 for contents.\par \par \uc2 The number of federal flood policies covering Florida homes and small businesses rose 2% between September 2017 and May 2018, to 1.76 million, according to government data. In Puerto Rico, the number of federal flood policies surged 77% over the period, to 9,199. In Texas, 17% more households and small businesses owned the policies, bringing the total to 702,800.\par \par \uc2 "We often see post-disaster increases in flood insurance policies in force, but unfortunately, it is not unusual to see some of these policies dropped when they come up for renewal," said David Maurstad, chief executive of the NFIP.\par \par \uc2 The Houston area was devastated by flooding after Harvey, and about 70% of the flood-related damage wasn't covered by insurance, according to \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 CoreLogic\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Insurers received 717,000 Harvey claims for damage to homes and vehicles as of Oct. 31, the most recent data available, according to the \uc2 Texas Department of Insurance\uc2 . About one-third were closed with no payment, indicating the damage wasn't covered under the policy or the loss value was less than the deductible.\par \par \uc2 Insurers in Florida received nearly one million Irma claims as of June 12, and 91% had been closed, according to the state's Office of Insurance Regulation. More than one-third of those closed didn't entail payment.\par \par \uc2 Lisa Wansley, a realtor in Middleburg, Fla., said a home insurer offered $800 to cover damage to her roof after taking into account her several-thousand-dollar deductible. "It costs more than that for a roof," she said. "This has just been a very frustrating battle."\par \par \uc2 Homeowners often fail to increase policy limits if they expand or upgrade their homes, regulators said.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Student housing, manufactured homes and industrial property were the top performing commercial real-estate sectors in the past 12 months, according to new data from \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 These three sectors outperformed the broader commercial property market, where values remained flat between June 2017 and the end of the first half of this year. Meanwhile, values fell 10% in the hard-hit retail sector during the 12-month period, according to Newport Beach, Calif.-based Green Street, which tracks the market with its Commercial Property Price Index.\par \par \uc2 The index monitors office buildings, malls, warehouses and other commercial property owned by real-estate investment trusts. REITs tend to own larger and higher-quality properties than many private landlords.\par \par \uc2 The latest data provides a window into the large rise in real-estate values since the recession, as well as investor sentiment about different types of property as the current business cycle moves into its ninth year of growth.\par \par \uc2 The Commercial Property Price Index was at 100 in August 2007, its pre-2008 crash high. It descended to a low of 61.2 inMay 2009.\par \par \uc2 Since then, the index more than doubled as the improving economy pushed rents and occupancies higher and demand strengthened from yield-hungry investors who could borrow money easily because of low interest rates.\par \par \uc2 But broad market values plateaued at the end of 2016 and have hovered at that level since then. In June, the broad index remained unchanged from the month before at 126.9.\par \par \uc2 The plateau is partly because of rising interest rates, said \uc2 Peter Rothemund\uc2 , a senior analyst at Green Street. Rising interest rates make it more expensive to finance purchases and make the bond market relatively more attractive compared with property.\par \par \uc2 Investors' demand for commercial real estate has also begun to slow as their concern rises that the economic expansion might be running out of steam. In the first five months of 2018, investors bought $176 billion of U.S. commercial real estate, down 2% from a year earlier, according \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But there are exceptions to these broad market trends. Investor appetite has remained strong for industrial property, which has experienced a 12% increase in values since June 2017, according to Green Street. Rents and occupancy rates have been particularly strong in this sector -- which includes warehouses and distribution centers -- thanks to growth in e-commerce.\par \par \uc2 Big industrial deals this year include \uc2 Prologis Inc\uc2 .'s agreement to buy logistics-property owner \uc2 DCT Industrial Trust Inc\uc2 . for $8.4 billion including debt. Also, private-equity giant \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2  is buying industrial and office REIT Gramercy Property Trust for $7.6 billion, including debt. Blackstone's offer represents a 15% premium over Gramercy's closing stock price before the deal was announced.\par \par \uc2 "The general thesis around future property-value increases [is] that industrial rents are growing at an especially fast pace above inflation throughout most of the U.S. -- even with a healthy amount of new construction," said \uc2 Eric Frankel\uc2 , a senior Green Street analyst. "Investors generally assume this will continue as e-commerce sales grow."\par \par \uc2 Student housing also performed well over the past 12 months, chalking up a 10% increase in values, Green Street said. These properties are considered to be more recession-resistant than other asset classes because even in an economic downturn, college enrollments are expected to remain steady.\par \par \uc2 Manufactured-home parks also remained a popular niche sector among investors. They require low capital costs and tend to be supply-constrained because community groups and local governments in recent years have slowed permitting processes.\par \par \uc2 According to Green Street, manufactured-home values rose 10% in the past 12 months. The firm's index tracking only that sector hit 178.3 at the end of June, compared with 158.5 in June 2017.\par \par \uc2 "You wind up increasing rents 3% a year regardless of what the economy is doing," Mr. Rothemund said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Shopping Centers\par \par \uc2 Under Pressure\par \par \uc2 Conditions aren't as sunny in other sectors. Values of malls and other shopping centers have stayed under pressureas consumers shop more online.\par \par \uc2 Mall values in June have fallen 9% over the past 12 months and 18% since the end of 2016, according to \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Merger-and-acquisition activity and portfolio deals, rather than single-property transactions, have driven most of the value changes for malls, said DJ Busch, Green Street's lead retail analyst.\par \par \uc2 In one of the biggest retail deals this year, \uc2 Brookfield Property Partners LP\uc2  said it would buy the remaining stake in mall owner \uc2 GGP Inc\uc2 . it didn't already own. The price Brookfield is paying is lower than some analysts expected, a sign of pressure on even top-quality mall portfolios.\par \par \uc2 Some owners are sitting on the sidelines, choosing to refinance their properties instead of trying to sell, said Jim Costello, a vice president at Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw514\pich480\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7710\pichgoal7200

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Investors who bet against \uc2 Netflix\uc2  this year erased some of their steep losses on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The streaming-video service's stock price fell as much as 14% in morning trading before rebounding to close 5.2% lower at $379.48.\par \par \uc2 The move came after \uc2 Netflix\uc2 's second-quarter results late Monday showed the company missed its own forecasts for subscriber growth. The company blamed issues with its internal forecasting, a problem it has faced in the past.\par \par \uc2 Short sellers, who seek to profit from a stock's fall, had paper profits of $366 million on Tuesday, according to S3 Partners, a financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company.\par \par \uc2 Those betting against the stock have been reducing the number of shares shorted as the stock has skyrocketed.\par \par \uc2 But the rising share price means shorts still had nearly $7 billion of value at risk on Monday, placing \uc2 Netflix\uc2 's stock among the most shorted U.S. stocks.\par \par \uc2 Greenlight Capital\uc2 , the hedge fund run by \uc2 David Einhorn\uc2 , is among the investors shorting the stock, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, citing an early 2018 investor presentation.\par \par \uc2 Short sellers typically borrow stock from a lender and sell it, hoping it has fallen by the time they buy it back to return it.\par \par \uc2 If it has dropped, the short seller captures the price difference after fees.\par \par \uc2 If the stock is up, as is the case with \uc2 Netflix\uc2  recently, losses can be unlimited.\par \par \uc2 Netflix\uc2  shares have been flying higher this year as the company invests heavily in original content.\par \par \uc2 Even with Tuesday's fall, the company's shares have nearly doubled since the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 Short sellers are nursing paper losses of $3.9 billion for the year, S3 data show.\par \par \uc2 Netflix\uc2 's rapid rise over the past two years has captivated Wall Street as well as brought out the short sellers who think the company's shares have run up too far.\par \par \uc2 "This expensive stock may take some time to find bullish footing again, but we continue to believe in the long-term value proposition for consumers and investors," Canaccord Genuity technology analyst Michael Graham said in a research note.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180718000057"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180718ee7i0001e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

As if to reinforce this, the Chinese insurance and banking group\u160\'00\'A0has launched an entire business dedicated to what it calls \u8220\'20\'1Cfintech inclusion\u8221\'20\'1D, or spreading blockchain and cloud-based technologies throughout China\u8217\'20\'19s banking system.\par \par \uc2 The fintech arm, called OneConnect, has for\u160\'00\'A0four years been selling its own homegrown technology to upgrade banks and other financial institutions with the latest in lending, fraud detection and credit assessment systems using \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Most recently, the company has\u160\'00\'A0 been enlisted \u160\'00\'A0by the \uc2 Hong Kong Monetary Authority\uc2  to build one of the largest blockchain-based trade financing platforms in the world, which is due to go live next month.\par \par \uc2 OneConnect\u8217\'20\'19s roots reach deep into the back-end of Shenzhen-based Ping An, one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest financial groups with about Rmb6.5tn ($971bn) in assets at the end of last year and 166m retail customers.\par \par \uc2 After building an in-house tech team to service its own needs several years ago, Ping An\u160\'00\'A0 spun out \u160\'00\'A0that core technology support division into a separate company that has now sold systems to more than 470 banks and 1,970 non-bank financial institutions. In the first three months of 2018 alone, it processed 180m credit inquiries for financial institutions in China. The company is now aiming for\u160\'00\'A0 an IPO \u160\'00\'A0this year.\par \par \uc2 FT Video: Ping An bets on tech\par \par \uc2 The tech on offer includes everything from mobile banking applications to credit scoring for loans and financial products as well as platforms for interbank transactions around the banks\u8217\'20\'19 core systems using blockchain technology. These\u160\'00\'A0are systems that could take years and major investments for small banks to complete; OneConnect says it can have them running with a fraction of the time and money it would take a small bank to build by itself.\par \par \uc2 Until recently most of OneConnect\u8217\'20\'19s business has been in China. Building the Hong Kong Trade Finance Platform, a blockchain-based system designed to streamline the flow of trade finance, is the company\u8217\'20\'19s first major project outside of mainland China.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to allow a vast amount of information to be shared between multiple parties with trust," said Jessica Tan, Ping An\u8217\'20\'19s deputy chief executive.\par \par \uc2 OneConnect was chosen to build the system because most of the technology needed is already commercially available in China.\par \par \uc2 By using blockchain to record each trade finance transaction, the system can detect common fraud. Companies often request more financing from banks than needed to fund trades. Once trades are logged in the blockchain, all parties will be able to view the level of financing requested and reduce the ability to acquire excess funds. In the same way it can cut back on over invoicing as well.\par \par \uc2 Small companies around the world struggle to get access to services such as trade finance because the cost for banks of doing due diligence does not justify the low revenues small businesses generate. OneConnect\u8217\'20\'19s technologies can extract a wide range of company data at a low cost to evaluate potential customers. This, the company says, will allow the trade finance platform \u8212\'20\'14 which will sign up 21 banks initially including \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and \uc2 Standard Chartered\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0to take on more small businesses.\par \par \uc2 There may be some sceptics who argue that OneConnect would be better off focusing on more promising technology than the blockchain, given it remains relatively unproven and in light of China's ambiguous attitude towards some parts of the crypto-asset universe.\par \par \uc2 But what the company is doing for China\u8217\'20\'19s banking sector has been likened to what \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2  did for tech start-ups over the past decade. A handful of companies around the world, such as Germany\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Fidor Bank\uc2  and China's \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2 , have sought to market their own tech to other banks. But the sheer volume of the blockchain technology the company has rolled out over the past few years makes OneConnect the largest of its kind.\par \par \uc2 Further fintech fascination\par \par \uc2 Klarna\uc2  this\u160\'00\'A0Very few companies end up inspiring their own verb like \uc2 Google\uc2 . But there are small signs, at least in the UK, that it is\u160\'00\'A0 happening to \uc2 Klarna\uc2 , the Swedish financial technology start-up. \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 Klarna\uc2  it,\u8221\'20\'1D a young woman\u160\'00\'A0urges her friend on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  who is hesitating about a purchase with online retailer Asos. Asos offers \uc2 Klarna\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cpay later\u8221\'20\'1D function, which gives shoppers 30 days to settle their purchases and allows them to return items without ever having paid for them. Valued at $2.5bn last year and led by co-founder\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Sebastian Siemiatkowski\uc2  (pictured)\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Klarna\uc2  has become one of Europe\u8217\'20\'19s biggest start-ups, second only to the recently listed Adyen in the fintech world. The Swedish group started by taking a traditional idea \u8212\'20\'14 the invoice \u8212\'20\'14 and adapting it to the online world. A year ago, it became the biggest fintech group in Europe to get a banking licence.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Free money ends\u160\'00\'A0China\u8217\'20\'19s two mobile payments giants, Alipay and\u160\'00\'A0Tencent, are poised to lose around $1bn in combined annual revenue to\u160\'00\'A0 a new central bank requirement \u160\'00\'A0that third-party payment groups hold all customer funds in reserve.\u160\'00\'A0Previously, third-party payment groups were permitted to invest customer funds, much as banks use deposits to make loans and other investments, even though unlike banks,\u160\'00\'A0the payment groups pay no interest to users.\u160\'00\'A0That era of free money is now drawing to a close.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Le Brexit\u160\'00\'A0The \uc2 French central bank\uc2  has turned up the pressure on hundreds of British payment providers and digital finance companies that have customers in France by asking them for details of their Brexit contingency plans.\u160\'00\'A0 The move \u160\'00\'A0is being seen by British payments companies as the latest salvo by Paris in\u160\'00\'A0 its campaign \u160\'00\'A0to challenge London as the European capital of the fast-growing financial technology sector.\par \par \uc2 Fintech\u160\'00\'A0views in the\u160\'00\'A0FT\u160\'00\'A0banking podcast\par \par \uc2 Bits and bobs\par \par \uc2 Proof of work\u160\'00\'A0Fujitsu has also filed almost 50 patents related to the technology in the hope that some day, these copyrighted blockchain-based inventions will generate cash. But much like most of the blockchain space outside of the magical world of ICOs, Fujitsu's long blockchain position is unlikely to have yielded any real returns so far. So now, the Japanese group is taking on a bolder approach to making some money out of the nebulous technology. For as little as 9,900 euros, the company is promising to develop a \u8220\'20\'1Cblockchain proof of business\u8221\'20\'1D for any customers in Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, within just one working week,\u160\'00\'A0writes Alphaville.\par \par \uc2 Taking stock\u160\'00\'A0Global banking regulators are assessing the size of banks\u8217\'20\'19 exposure to \u8220\'20\'1Ccrypto-assets\u8221\'20\'1D such as bitcoin and looking at introducing capital safeguards, in a move that could deter banks from embracing the nascent market.\u160\'00\'A0 A report \u160\'00\'A0revealed that the \uc2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\uc2  is \u8220\'20\'1Cconducting an initial stock take on the materiality of banks\u8217\'20\'19 direct and indirect exposures to crypto-assets\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Fire the chatbot\u160\'00\'A0If you didn\u8217\'20\'19t catch\u160\'00\'A0the big news, it was the first public firing of a robot. In this case, a bank\u8217\'20\'19s chatbot, Amelia. Amelia was launched last year by Swedish bank Nordnet, with the aim of speeding up customer onboarding and improving customer satisfaction. Apparently, she achieved neither and so was sacked for underperformance,\u160\'00\'A0writes Chris Skinner.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180717ee7h004ed\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

An earlier version of this article incorrectly said ThetaRay recently held a Series A venture round and misspelled the CEO's name. (July 17, 2018)\par \par \uc2 Recent investments in companies that deal with financial crime and compliance have put these firms on the radar of venture capitalists and private-equity funds, especially as they offer savvier ways to streamline compliance for banks and financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 Following years of big fines for money laundering and other compliance failures, banks bulked up on compliance staff, hiring thousands of employees, in some cases, to sift through transactions and monitor for suspicious activity. That manpower has become a cost burden for banks, observers say, especially as fines decline and a cultural understanding of compliance improves. Banks are looking to explore technological alternatives and analytical research that can augment the surge in human activity.\par \par \uc2 "We need better ways to process the data to find the signal in the noise," said \uc2 Enrique Salem\uc2 , a managing director at investment firm \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2 's venture arm. Mr. Salem was previously chief executive of Symantec Corp., a cybersecurity firm.\par \par \uc2 Compliance-focused firms that recently secured capital include consultancy Exiger LLC; Israeli startup ThetaRay; and Sigma Ratings, which evaluates company risks not related to credit. Exiger reeled in $80 million from \uc2 Carrick Capital Partners\uc2 , ThetaRay held a $30 million Series B venture round, and Sigma Ratings pulled $2.4 million in seed funding. Navex Global, a compliance software provider, said Tuesday it was acquired by private-equity firm \uc2 BC Partners\uc2  for an undisclosed sum; existing investors \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2  will retain a minority stake in the company.\par \par \uc2 Their offerings range from consulting services to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  software that helps banks with customer due diligence and transaction monitoring.\par \par \uc2 "Financial institutions are trying to approach compliance in a smarter way to eliminate manual, repetitive processes," said Sven Stumbauer, a managing director of AlixPartners, a consultancy that helps banks with compliance.\par \par \uc2 The market for anti-money-laundering software is expected to reach $4.1 billion by 2026, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 12.5%, according to a Credence Research report released last month. Transaction-monitoring software is the top-selling product, which the market research firm expects to continue.\par \par \uc2 "With advancements in technologies, the related regulatory framework is evolving continuously," the report said. "In order to accommodate these changes, developers are continually updating their anti-money laundering software to comply with enacted regulations."\par \par \uc2 Financial crime compliance, however, "doesn't fall neatly into one bucket" of investment, said Brandon Lee, an associate managing director in \uc2 K2 Intelligence\uc2 's regulatory compliance practice.\par \par \uc2 Investment areas in compliance can include financial technology, regulation technology, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and others, he said, adding that the firms offering transaction monitoring have seen particularly high interest from investors and financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 "Current transaction monitoring systems are ineffective at locating money laundering activity," Mr. Lee said. "\b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  is trying to augment today's capabilities, to not only detect traditional money laundering behavior but also [to] self-reinforce and self-teach and self-learn new ways of money laundering."\par \par \uc2 Exiger, a consultancy co-founded by Mike Cherkasky, a former chairman of New York's Commission on Public Integrity, seeks to use its $80 million investment to make acquisitions and expand its technology offerings to banks. The firm got its start when Mr. Cherkasky served as the compliance monitor for \uc2 HSBC Holdings PLC\uc2  when \uc2 HSBC\uc2  settled accusations of insufficient money-laundering controls by U.S. authorities in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The firm has grown since then, with 470 employees managing 250 clients now, Mr. Cherkasky said in an interview. It quickly diversified away from monitorships, he said, moving toward embedding itself in financial institutions to work directly on bank compliance. Exiger's technology goes beyond curation and screening of databases, he said. "This is teaching computers to think and act like a human compliance researcher," he said.\par \par \uc2 ThetaRay's fundraising round included \uc2 Jerusalem Venture Partners\uc2 , \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Bank Hapoalim\uc2 , and the firm said it would use the capital to expand its presence in Europe, Asia and the U.S. to help its largest customers, and to get into new areas, such as payment or credit-card fraud.\par \par \uc2 The company's \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology is intended to help financial institutions identify the earliest signs of money laundering. Chief Executive Mark Gazit said in an interview that the technology can teach itself once given the proper initial instructions.\par \par \uc2 "Our system is like a human child's brain," he said.\par \par \uc2 Sigma Ratings offers a different kind of compliance product: It rates the financial crime risks of smaller institutions in emerging markets. Stuart Jones, the firm's chief executive, told The Wall Street Journal last year that Sigma's product was created as a response to changes in correspondent banking, with global financial institutions shying away from many markets due to risk.\par \par \uc2 Sigma, which seeks to compete with the likes of \uc2 Standard & Poor's\uc2  and \uc2 Moody's\uc2 , announced its first rating last year, of a Maltese bank, and it expects to have 500 rating decisions completed by the end of the month.\par \par \uc2 "Risk is evolving, and credit risk only gives you part of the picture," said Mr. Jones. "Risk associated with counterparty illicit finance and conduct risk is equally\u8212\'20\'14if not more\u8212\'20\'14important for companies operating in complex markets."\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180717ee7h000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Tighter national security reviews have curbed Chinese deal-making in the U.S., but a new study shows China is pouring money into cutting-edge American technologies at a record pace this year through loosely regulated venture-capital investments.\par \par \uc2 Chinese foreign-direct investment into the U.S., made through deals such as acquisitions, fell into negative territory during the first five months of the year, according to data that takes asset sales into account from the Rhodium Group, a New York consulting firm.\par \par \uc2 Yet the figures belie China's sustained interest in U.S. technology, which it is continuing to target through relatively unrestricted investments in startups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, Rhodium said in a new report reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 The report's findings could give fresh momentum to national security hawks who have singled out Chinese investment as posing disproportionate risks to the U.S. because the entities may be directed and subsidized by the government of China, an economic and military rival.\par \par \uc2 Over the period from January to May 2018, Chinese venture capital investment in the U.S. had already reached nearly $2.4 billion, which was its previous full-year record set in 2015, according to Rhodium's analysis.\par \par \uc2 From 2000 through May 2018, Rhodium found more than 1,300 funding rounds of U.S. startups with at least one Chinese-controlled investor, representing an estimated $11 billion in Chinese investment. Around three-quarters of those transactions have occurred since 2014, says the report by Thilo Hanemann, Adam Lysenko and Daniel Rosen.\par \par \uc2 The estimates reflect some larger deals recently, as the total number of deals involving Chinese investors is down slightly from 2016 and 2017.\par \par \uc2 Venture capital is defined by investments targeting startups with big potential that require large amounts of money in early days. It typically involves groups of investors that each take small stakes and gradually put in more money as the company grows.\par \par \uc2 Chinese investors targeting startups have historically focused their investments in the information and communications technology sectors as well as the health, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology sectors, Rhodium found.\par \par \uc2 They are also targeting technologies such as 3-D printing, robotics and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and recently have plowed money into companies such as Grail, a Silicon Valley cancer detection startup, the report said.\par \par \uc2 The new data on venture investing, which is notoriously hard to track given complex legal structures and limited disclosure requirements, comes amid an array of potential actions by the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  to further regulate foreign tech investing.\par \par \uc2 The White House in June was close to imposing a set of tough new restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S., including through venture-capital funds, but backed away at the last minute, saying it would instead throw its weight behind proposed congressional legislation with similar objectives.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on that legislation to curb a range of Chinese investment by strengthening the \uc2 Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The interagency committee, known as \uc2 CFIUS\uc2 , advises the president on when to block foreign deals on national security grounds.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 CFIUS\uc2  has traditionally focused on foreign takeovers, the new legislation would strengthen the committee's authority to review minority investments from foreign entities, including venture-capital funds, in "critical technology."\par \par \uc2 U.S. venture-capital investors worry that could lead to slower deals, or could spur startups to avoid some foreign investors.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich508\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal7620

The prices shown are the latest available before publication and may not be the current dealing levels because of an intervening portfolio revaluation or a switch to a forward pricing basis.
