All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CC Land Holdings Ltd\uc2 ., backed by a Hong Kong property tycoon, has agreed to pay GBP 1.15 billion ($1.42 billion) for a London skyscraper in one of the city's biggest real-estate deals.\par \par \uc2 British Land PLC\uc2  and \uc2 Oxford Properties Group\uc2 , the real-estate arm of Canadian pension fund \uc2 OMERS\uc2 , said Wednesday that they sold the Leadenhall Building, known locally as the Cheesegrater for its triangular shape.\par \par \uc2 Investment in London property from China and Hong Kong has surged in recent months. A weak pound versus the yuan, in addition to economic and political pressures at home, have been driving the acquisition spree.\par \par \uc2 CC Land Holdings, controlled by \uc2 Cheung Chung Kiu\uc2 , bought a different London office building for GBP 292 million earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 At 736 feet, or 224 meters, the Cheesegrater is the tallest tower in London's main financial district. It was valued at GBP 915 million at the end of September.\par \par \uc2 The deal is the biggest transaction of a single London building since Qatar's sovereign-wealth fund bought the London headquarters of \uc2 HSBC Holdings PLC\uc2  for more than GBP 1.1 billion in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Investors from China and Hong Kong bought more than GBP 3 billion of central London property last year, more than those from the U.S. or Europe, according to real-estate broker JLL.\par \par \uc2 The influx stands out because U.K. property transaction volumes have fallen sharply in the past year. Britain's decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , as well as high prices following a multiyear property boom, have made some overseas investors wary of current values.\par \par \uc2 But for Chinese investors, London property looks much different.\par \par \uc2 Currency has been a big factor. While the yuan has lost value against the dollar, it is up 12% versus sterling since the Brexit vote in June, making assets in the U.K. a bargain.\par \par \uc2 Yields on London property are also attractive relative to those in Hong Kong, a boon for investors hunting for returns in an environment of ultralow interest rates at global central banks.\par \par \uc2 The average capitalization rate -- a measure of yield -- on offices in the City of London was 4.6% at the end of last year, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In Hong Kong, the yield on offices was just 2.6%.\par \par \uc2 Worries that the Chinese property market is overheated, and the chance that Beijing could impose more-stringent curbs on outbound capital flows from China is also speeding efforts to invest overseas, further driving demand for London property.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Olga Cotaga contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170301000058"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170301ed320003c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2  introduced an online chatbot to the public in 2016, executives were keen to present the technology as an aid for hard-pressed call-centre agents. But it was clear the chatbot\u8217\'20\'19s powers would grow and perhaps, in time, could come to rival those of its human colleagues.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/artificial-intelligence-robotics"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \\b Artificial intelligence\\b0 }}}\uc2 , \uc2 RBS\uc2  said, lets the chatbot \u8212\'20\'14 first named Luvo but now called Assist \u8212\'20\'14 handle routine web chat requests from clients, such as queries about address changes or asking for a bank card to be authorised. This would free human advisers to help customers with more complex questions.\par \par \uc2 The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www-03.ibm.com/press/uk/en/pressrelease/50729.wss"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 initial trial }}}\uc2  that began in December has been limited to 10 per cent of \uc2 RBS\uc2  customers in Scotland who use web chat to communicate with the bank. Queries that Assist cannot understand or process are passed to human advisers.\par \par \uc2 But Assist\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Ccognitive\u8221\'20\'1D capabilities, provided by \uc2 IBM\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s cloud-based Watson platform, mean it will learn to handle a greater range of more complex tasks. \uc2 IBM\uc2  executives suggest this could even reach the point where it might be able to understand how a customer is feeling \u8212\'20\'14 dissatisfied, frustrated, happy \u8212\'20\'14 and change its tone and actions accordingly.\par \par \uc2 The rise of AI in handling customer inquiries across a range of industries \u8212\'20\'14 from retail to energy companies \u8212\'20\'14 strongly suggests that human jobs in call centres may eventually be whittled away, but that those who remain in employment are likely to be handling more complex inquiries, says Shamus Rae, head of innovation and investment at management consultancy \uc2 KPMG\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAI is already making its presence felt by its ability to handle web chats, and over the next 18 months we expect to see the same automation of simple transactions happen with voice calls too,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThat, to my mind, can only lead to the replacement of some call-centre staff, but there will still be a need for human-to-human conversations to work through more complicated issues with customers.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Whether that adds to staff stress levels, by leaving them to focus only on difficult customers with serious problems, or makes the job more interesting will probably depend on the attitude and aptitude of call-centre workers. In job satisfaction terms, AI could be a good thing, suggests Graeme Gabriel, a former call-centre agent and manager who now works as a consultant at call-centre software company Verint.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs a call-centre agent, it\u8217\'20\'19s those more complex inquiries that are the more rewarding part of the job,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CAfter several hours straight on the phone, taking calls about simple things like a change of address, you actually look forward to someone calling up with an issue, even if they\u8217\'20\'19re having a bit of a moan, because that brings into play your customer service skills, the stuff you\u8217\'20\'19ve been trained to handle.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Like many in the call-centre industry, he sees a role for AI not just in automating the mundane and routine, but also in assisting human workers to solve complex and challenging problems.\par \par \uc2 Much of the training that call-centre agents receive, Mr Gabriel, says, focuses on managing customer \u8220\'20\'1Chold times\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 the amount of time someone has to wait on the other end of the phone listening to music or company messages \u8212\'20\'14 while staff search for information or type in data. Lengthy hold times can make customers impatient.\par \par \uc2 Instead, AI could be working in the background, acting as a smart assistant to call-centre agents, feeding them accurate, up-to-date information, prompting them to ask the right questions and guiding their responses to queries.\par \par \uc2 Sheryl Kingstone, analyst at emerging technology specialist 451 Research, thinks this kind of AI \u8220\'20\'1Cintelligence layer\u8221\'20\'1D is overdue. \u8220\'20\'1CTypically, staff use a trial-and-error script to question the customer and gain a better understanding of the request or problem, but this is time consuming and inaccurate, increasing fatigue and frustration both for the employee and the customer.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 By guiding interactions, AI could help humans focus more on meeting customers\u8217\'20\'19 needs, building relationships with them and increasing revenues through selling additional products and services, according to Stian Westlake, executive director of policy and research at innovation agency Nesta.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAI also makes it easier to connect customers to call-centre workers with particular skills, such as problem resolution or sales, making call-centre jobs more differentiated, since it makes it easier to deploy talented call-centre staff to calls where they can really add value,\u8221\'20\'1D he adds.\par \par \uc2 This shift is already under way, says \uc2 Chetan Dube\uc2 , chief executive of IPSoft, the company behind AI virtual agent Amelia. Amelia is assisting call-centre staff rather than interacting directly with customers in about 10 of the 30 IPSoft clients who have deployed it. These include a Swiss bank that is using Amelia to guide call-centre agents through the process of helping customers with their retirement planning.\par \par \uc2 Mr Dube says: \u8220\'20\'1CThere are two aspects to the use of AI in call centres. One is through the displacement of mundane chores that represent a waste of the brains and talents of call-centre agents. The second is as assisted intelligence, which leads to an augmented experience for agent and customer. I\u8217\'20\'19d argue this makes the job of call-centre agent more fulfilling. It elevates the worker.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Joe Gagnon, chief customer strategy officer at technology company \uc2 Aspect Software\uc2 , says the ability of AI to take on routine matters will benefit staff. \u8220\'20\'1CAs a result they will be happier, of greater value to the company, and develop a more positive perspective on their role.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170301ed31002be\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Its overall investment movement, however, was positive, netting $3.2bn.\par \par \uc2 Both management and performance fees at Man also declined, but one of the biggest hits was from foreign exchange translation and other moves, which cost it $2.9bn, just slightly less than in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Shares in the group slumped nearly 10 per cent after the news, and by 3pm were trading down 1.8 per cent at 143.8p.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe market environment was very unforgiving for the first three quarters and Man found it difficult to generate performance for clients and performance fees,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 Luke Ellis\uc2 , chief executive of Man, said in the results. \u8220\'20\'1CThis led to disappointing profits.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The company has started 2017 with \u8220\'20\'1Ca good pipeline of interest from clients and encouraging performance across most of our strategies,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr Ellis said Man had already started to benefit from \u8220\'20\'1Can improved environment for active management\u8221\'20\'1D under Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe jury is out as to whether Donald Trump\u8217\'20\'19s presidency will be good for the overall economy, but what is beyond doubt is his way of thinking, which has had a significant impact on the market environment for active investment managers,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Ellis said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn a Trump world, there are \u8216\'20\'18winners and losers\u8217\'20\'19 and everyone is not equal, which means the divergence between favourable and unfavourable asset classes and companies becomes increasingly significant; it\u8217\'20\'19s the differing outcomes we see which can create the opportunities for alpha.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Peter Lenardos, an analyst with \uc2 RBC Capital Markets\uc2 , called the results \u8220\'20\'1Cmixed\u8221\'20\'1D, but said the pipeline for new investment was likely to be positive, based on the company\u8217\'20\'19s indication.\par \par \uc2 Despite the writedown of GLG by $281m, Mr Ellis said the unit \u8220\'20\'1Cremains a crucial part\u8221\'20\'1D of the business. Several initiatives, such as increasingly using quantitative analysis and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to inform the discretionary traders, \u8220\'20\'1Cwill improve the consistency of performance,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 The company also said it was undergoing a restructuring, which it began last year after Mr Ellis took over as chief executive following \uc2 Manny Roman\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s departure to Pimco, the US bond giant.\par \par \uc2 The restructuring will cost the company about $21m, with $17m of that accounting for compensation charges in 2016. The savings should amount to about $20m per year, starting this year, the company said.\par \par \uc2 Following the acquisition of Aalto, which completed at the start of the year, Man has $325m of surplus capital. Mr Ellis has said that money could be used for acquisitions, investment teams or hiring individuals.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170301ed31005xx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Algorithms Human agents are still needed for complicated questions, writes Jessica Twentyman\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2  introduced an online chatbot to the public in 2016, executives were keen to present the technology as an aid for hard-pressed call-centre agents. But it was clear the chatbot's powers would grow and perhaps, in time, could come to rival those of its human colleagues.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \uc2 RBS\uc2  said, lets the chatbot - first named Luvo but now called Assist - handle routine web chat requests from clients, such as queries about address changes or asking for a bank card to be authorised. This would free human advisers to help customers with more complex questions.\par \par \uc2 The initial trial that began in December has been limited to 10 per cent of \uc2 RBS\uc2  customers in Scotland who use web chat to communicate with the bank. Queries that Assist cannot understand or process are passed to human advisers.\par \par \uc2 But Assist's "cognitive" capabilities, provided by \uc2 IBM\uc2 's cloud-based Watson platform, mean it will learn to handle a greater range of more complex tasks. \uc2 IBM\uc2  executives suggest this could even reach the point where it might be able to understand how a customer is feeling - dissatisfied, frustrated, happy - and change its tone and actions accordingly.\par \par \uc2 The rise of AI in handling customer inquiries across a range of industries - from retail to energy companies - strongly suggests that human jobs in call centres may eventually be whittled away, but that those who remain in employment are likely to be handling more complex inquiries, says Shamus Rae, head of innovation and investment at management consultancy \uc2 KPMG\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "AI is already making its presence felt by its ability to handle web chats, and over the next 18 months we expect to see the same automation of simple transactions happen with voice calls too," he says. "That, to my mind, can only lead to the replacement of some call-centre staff, but there will still be a need for human-to-human conversations to work through more complicated issues with customers."\par \par \uc2 Whether that adds to staff stress levels, by leaving them to focus only on difficult customers with serious problems, or makes the job more interesting will probably depend on the attitude and aptitude of call-centre workers. In job satisfaction terms, AI could be a good thing, suggests Graeme Gabriel, a former call-centre agent and manager who now works as a consultant at call-centre software company Verint.\par \par \uc2 "As a call-centre agent, it's those more complex inquiries that are the more rewarding part of the job," he says. "After several hours straight on the phone, taking calls about simple things like a change of address, you actually look forward to someone calling up with an issue, even if they're having a bit of a moan, because that brings into play your customer service skills, the stuff you've been trained to handle."\par \par \uc2 Like many in the call-centre industry, he sees a role for AI not just in automating the mundane and routine, but also in assisting human workers to solve complex and challenging problems.\par \par \uc2 Much of the training that call-centre agents receive, Mr Gabriel, says, focuses on managing customer "hold times" - the amount of time someone has to wait on the other end of the phone listening to music or company messages - while staff search for information or type in data. Lengthy hold times can make customers impatient.\par \par \uc2 Instead, AI could be working in the background, acting as a smart assistant to call-centre agents, feeding them accurate, up-to-date information, prompting them to ask the right questions and guiding their responses to queries.\par \par \uc2 Sheryl Kingstone, analyst at emerging technology specialist 451 Research, thinks this kind of AI "intelligence layer" is overdue. "Typically, staff use a trial-and-error script to question the customer and gain a better understanding of the request or problem, but this is time consuming and inaccurate, increasing fatigue and frustration both for the employee and the customer."\par \par \uc2 By guiding interactions, AI could help humans focus more on meeting customers' needs, building relationships with them and increasing revenues through selling additional products and services, according to Stian Westlake, executive director of policy and research at innovation agency Nesta.\par \par \uc2 "AI also makes it easier to connect customers to call-centre workers with particular skills, such as problem resolution or sales, making call-centre jobs more differentiated, since it makes it easier to deploy talented call-centre staff to calls where they can really add value," he adds.\par \par \uc2 This shift is already under way, says \uc2 Chetan Dube\uc2 , chief executive of IPSoft, the company behind AI virtual agent Amelia. Amelia is assisting call-centre staff rather than interacting directly with customers in about 10 of the 30 IPSoft clients who have deployed it. These include a Swiss bank that is using Amelia to guide call-centre agents through the process of helping customers with their retirement planning.\par \par \uc2 Mr Dube says: "There are two aspects to the use of AI in call centres. One is through the displacement of mundane chores that represent a waste of the brains and talents of call-centre agents. The second is as assisted intelligence, which leads to an augmented experience for agent and customer. I'd argue this makes the job of call-centre agent more fulfilling. It elevates the worker."\par \par \uc2 Joe Gagnon, chief customer strategy officer at technology company \uc2 Aspect Software\uc2 , says the ability of AI to take on routine matters will benefit staff. "As a result they will be happier, of greater value to the company, and develop a more positive perspective on their role."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170301ed3100003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CC Land Holdings Ltd\uc2 , backed by a Hong Kong property tycoon, has agreed to pay \u163\'00\'A31.15 billion ($1.42 billion) for a London skyscraper in one of the city's biggest ever real estate deals.\par \par \uc2 British Land PLC\uc2  and \uc2 Oxford Properties Group\uc2 , the real-estate arm of Canadian pension fund \uc2 OMERS\uc2 , said Wednesday that they sold the Leadenhall Building, known locally as the Cheesegrater for its triangular shape.\par \par \uc2 Investment in London property from China and Hong Kong has surged in recent months. A weak pound versus the yuan, alongside {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/london-property-regains-its-currency-appeal-1488295333"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 economic and political pressures at home}}}\uc2 , have been driving the acquisition spree.\par \par \uc2 CC Land Holdings, controlled by \uc2 Cheung Chung Kiu\uc2 , bought a different London office building for \u163\'00\'A3292 million earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 At 736 feet, the Cheesegrater is the tallest tower in London's main financial district. It was valued at \u163\'00\'A3915 million at the end of September.\par \par \uc2 The deal is the biggest transaction of a single London building since Qatar's sovereign-wealth fund {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-fund-buys-hsbcs-london-headquarters-1418649862"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bought the London headquarters of HSBC Holdings }}}\uc2 PLC for over \u163\'00\'A31.1 billion in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Investors from China and Hong Kong {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-investors-pile-into-london-property-1487073610"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bought more than \u163\'00\'A33 billion of central London property}}}\uc2  last year, more than those from the U.S. or Europe, according to real-estate broker JLL.\par \par \uc2 The influx stands out because U.K. property transaction {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/european-property-investors-look-beyond-london-1477274461"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 volumes have fallen sharply}}}\uc2  in the last year. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boe-still-sees-brexit-damaging-economy-in-long-run-1487677118"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Britain's decision to leave the European Union}}}\uc2 , as well as high prices following a multi-year property boom, have made some overseas investors wary of current values.\par \par \uc2 But for Chinese investors, London property looks much different.\par \par \uc2 Currency has been a big factor. While the yuan has lost value against the dollar, it is up 12% versus sterling since the Brexit vote last June, making assets in the U.K. a bargain.\par \par \uc2 Yields on London property are also attractive relative to those in Hong Kong, a boon for investors hunting for returns in an environment of ultra-low interest rates at global central banks.\par \par \uc2 The average capitalization rate\u8212\'20\'14a measure of yield\u8212\'20\'14on offices in the City of London was 4.6% at the end of last year, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . In Hong Kong, the yield on offices was just 2.6%.\par \par \uc2 Worries that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-to-start-worrying-again-about-chinese-property-1484023452"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the Chinese property market is overheated}}}\uc2 , and the possibility that Beijing could impose more {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-issuing-strict-controls-on-overseas-investment-1480071529"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 stringent curbs on outbound capital flows }}}\uc2 from China is also speeding efforts to invest overseas, further driving demand for London property.\par \par \uc2 Analysts for months have expected \uc2 British Land\uc2  to sell its 50% stake in the Cheesegrater. \uc2 British Land\uc2  said Wednesday it will use the money from the sale to pay down its debt.\par \par \uc2 The Cheesegrater's 46 floors of office space are fully let. Completed in the summer of 2014, the building's angled design stems from local planning requirements that preserve views of St. Paul's Cathedral from certain vantage points.\par \par \uc2 "This sale shows continued investor appetite for best in class, well located property in London," said \uc2 Tim Roberts\uc2 , head of offices and residential at \uc2 British Land\uc2 , in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Olga Cotaga contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Art Patnaude at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:art.patnaude@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 art.patnaude@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170301ed310038p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Man Group\uc2  is managing more money than ever, but losses and redemptions in many of its funds during a difficult year led to a pre-tax loss for 2016 and a writedown of the value of GLG, its discretionary trading unit.\par \par \uc2 The world\u8217\'20\'19s largest publicly traded hedge fund group managed $80.9bn at the end of 2016, up 3 per cent from the end of 2015.\par \par \uc2 The company was buoyed by a 20 per cent increase in investments in its quant alternative strategies, which use computer algorithms to make investing decisions, positive performance in its long-only and credit funds, and the purchase of Aalto Invest, a $1.7bn US property manager.\par \par \uc2 But GLG was hit by redemptions in alternative and long-only strategies, driven by poor returns and a move among investors towards cheaper, passive products.\par \par \uc2 The company reported a pre-tax loss of $272m, down from a profit of $184m in 2015, largely driven by the impairment of GLG\u8217\'20\'19s carrying value, currency swings and investment losses. Its overall investment movement, however, was positive, netting $3.2bn.\par \par \uc2 Both management and performance fees at Man also declined, but one of the biggest hits was from foreign exchange translation and other moves, which cost it $2.9bn, just slightly less than in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Shares in the group slumped nearly 10 per cent after the news, and by 3pm were trading down 1.8 per cent at 143.8p.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe market environment was very unforgiving for the first three quarters and Man found it difficult to generate performance for clients and performance fees,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 Luke Ellis\uc2 , chief executive of Man, said in the results. \u8220\'20\'1CThis led to disappointing profits.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The company has started 2017 with \u8220\'20\'1Ca good pipeline of interest from clients and encouraging performance across most of our strategies,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr Ellis said Man had already started to benefit from \u8220\'20\'1Can improved environment for active management\u8221\'20\'1D under Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe jury is out as to whether Donald Trump\u8217\'20\'19s presidency will be good for the overall economy, but what is beyond doubt is his way of thinking, which has had a significant impact on the market environment for active investment managers,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Ellis said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn a Trump world, there are \u8216\'20\'18winners and losers\u8217\'20\'19 and everyone is not equal, which means the divergence between favourable and unfavourable asset classes and companies becomes increasingly significant; it\u8217\'20\'19s the differing outcomes we see which can create the opportunities for alpha.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Peter Lenardos, an analyst with \uc2 RBC Capital Markets\uc2 , called the results \u8220\'20\'1Cmixed\u8221\'20\'1D, but said the pipeline for new investment was likely to be positive, based on the company\u8217\'20\'19s indication.\par \par \uc2 Despite the writedown of GLG by $281m, Mr Ellis said the unit \u8220\'20\'1Cremains a crucial part\u8221\'20\'1D of the business. Several initiatives, such as increasingly using quantitative analysis and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to inform the discretionary traders, \u8220\'20\'1Cwill improve the consistency of performance,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 The company also said it was undergoing a restructuring, which it began last year after Mr Ellis took over as chief executive following \uc2 Manny Roman\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s departure to Pimco, the US bond giant.\par \par \uc2 The restructuring will cost the company about $21m, with $17m of that accounting for compensation charges in 2016. The savings should amount to about $20m per year, starting this year, the company said.\par \par \uc2 Following the acquisition of Aalto, which completed at the start of the year, Man has $325m of surplus capital. Mr Ellis has said that money could be used for acquisitions, investment teams or hiring individuals.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020170301ed310063h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Life sciences startups Grail Inc. and \uc2 Freenome Inc\uc2 . have raised a total of about $1 billion to develop blood tests to detect cancers in their earliest stages, well before symptoms appear.\par \par \uc2 Through early detection, Grail, \uc2 Freenome\uc2  and other companies hope to catch tumors when the prospects for a cure are highest. The promise of making cancer screening easier and more effective has lured numerous investors and scientific collaborators to these and other blood-testing startups.\par \par \uc2 Grail, which secured more than $900 million in the first closing of a Series B round, said \uc2 Johnson & Johnson Innovation\uc2  is the largest investor in the financing. Other investors include \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 ARCH Venture Partners\uc2 , \uc2 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Celgene Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Merck & Co\uc2 ., McKesson Ventures, \uc2 Tencent Holdings Ltd\uc2 . and \uc2 Varian Medical Systems Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Menlo Park, Calif.-based Grail said it expects to close on the rest of the round this month but didn't specify the amount.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  is leading a $65 million Series A investment in \uc2 Freenome\uc2 , which collected $5.5 million last year. \uc2 Allen & Co\uc2 ., AME Cloud Ventures, \uc2 Asset Management Ventures\uc2 , \uc2 Charles River Ventures\uc2 , Data Collective, \uc2 Founders Fund\uc2 , GV (formerly \uc2 Google Ventures\uc2 ), Innovation Endeavors, \uc2 Polaris Partners\uc2 , Spectrum 28 and Third Kind Ventures also participated.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of blood-testing or "liquid biopsy" {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/liquid-biopsy-startups-face-long-road-to-payoff-1464003003"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 companies}}}\uc2  have emerged to detect cancer signals in the blood. Most have sought to predict the best treatment for people already known to have cancer. Startups like Grail and \uc2 Freenome\uc2  are pushing upstream to target cancer detection.\par \par \uc2 Grail's approach involves analyzing fragments of tumor DNA shed into the blood. The fraction of circulating-tumor DNA in the bloodstream compared to non-tumor DNA is small, but Grail says it can detect these faint signals. The new cash infusion will finance studies involving hundreds of thousands of participants, including cancer patients and people who haven't been diagnosed with the disease.\par \par \uc2 Freenome\uc2 's technology employs \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to search for genetic signatures of cancer.

Not once did Mr. Trump mention the dismantling of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, claims of a dearth of bank lending, or any of the other financial matters the Trump administration has previously touted as among the president's priorities.\par \par \uc2 Instead it echoed the campaign trail, where Mr. Trump's regular stump speech only occasionally touched on financial regulatory policy. Some in the financial sector are surely pleased Mr. Trump didn't repeat his campaign promise of a 21st century version of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated traditional and investment banking. His Treasury secretary, \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2 , endorsed the pledge at a January Senate hearing without offering specifics.\par \par \uc2 On some issues, Mr. Trump's silence may be helpful. \uc2 Cowen & Co\uc2 . analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note before the speech that if Mr. Trump didn't mention housing finance legislation, "that is actually a positive for getting housing finance reform as we believe the probability for action is better if this is a process that the Senate drives forward."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump didn't bring it up.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, banking groups may be disappointed that there was no mention of the idea that loosening financial regulations would help the economy, despite the fact that Mr. Trump talked about what he views as a laggard economy.\par \par \uc2 A push by Mr. Trump could have elevated changing Dodd-Frank on the legislative agenda, where there already are indications the timeline for changing financial regulations may be slipping.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump may want to push deregulation without talking about it, but Democrats appeared happy to bring it up as a cudgel highlighting the president's Wall Street ties. In their Tuesday response, former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear accused the president early in his administration of "rolling back rules that provide oversight of the financial industry and safeguard us against another national economic meltdown." Mr. Beshear was referencing executive actions Mr. Trump has signed laying out a framework for altering financial regulations put in place during the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 Of course, there is much deregulation that Mr. Trump's team can do without legislation, once his financial regulatory nominees are in place. Mr. Trump's advisers say filling the key job of Federal Reserve vice chair for bank oversight is a top priority, but so far Mr. Trump hasn't done so. At least nine other major regulatory jobs are empty, along with senior posts in the Treasury Department. His one financial regulatory nominee\u8212\'20\'14lawyer \uc2 Jay Clayton\uc2 , tapped to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u8212\'20\'14has yet to get a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Republicans are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-warn-fed-against-adopting-new-rules-before-senate-confirms-trump-nominee-1487908416"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 issuing threats against any regulator}}}\uc2  who dares propose a rule change before Mr. Trump's team is in place.\par \par \uc2 After Tuesday's speech, those appointments look even more important, and the game of financial deregulation looks even more like it will be played to a great extent outside Congress\par \par \uc2 Note to readers: Starting the week of March 6th, this newsletter will appear in your inbox from WSJ Pro Financial Regulation, replacing the current "from" name of Jacob Schlesinger, WSJ Pro.

Such loans total roughly $40 billion to $50 billion in annual issuance, according to consulting firm Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Bank loans are cheaper than issuing debt in the public markets in part because they don't require a rating, which can cost a municipality tens of thousands of dollars, and typically don't carry the same disclosure requirements.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's proposal is uncontroversial and is one of a handful of measures the \uc2 SEC\uc2  is able to advance despite its depleted ranks. The agency is operating with just two commissioners, three fewer than its full complement.\par \par \uc2 Jay Clayton\uc2 , President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's pick to head the agency on a full-time basis, is awaiting Senate confirmation. The \uc2 SEC\uc2 's acting chief is Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar. The other current commissioner is \uc2 Kara Stein\uc2 , a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 Unlike publicly traded corporations, borrowers in the municipal-bond market are exempt from requirements to file documents with the \uc2 SEC\uc2  before they sell bonds and file updates on a regular basis. As a result, the \uc2 SEC\uc2  regulates municipal-debt disclosures only indirectly through banks, prohibiting them from underwriting the bonds unless the issuer enters into private disclosure agreements with investors.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's move is expected to expand an existing list of "material events" municipal borrowers agree to disclose on a continuing basis after the issuance of their debt.\par \par \uc2 If the proposal is adopted by the \uc2 SEC\uc2 , the list would expand to include a requirement to disclose the terms of any loans the borrowers may have entered into with a bank outside the public markets, according to people familiar with the matter. It also may include a requirement that municipalities disclose the details of any swaps contracts they enter into with banks.\par \par \uc2 Currently the list encompasses more than a dozen events ranging from payment delinquencies to ratings changes.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2  will seek public comment on Wednesday's proposal. After the comment period, the agency would have to vote on the measure before it could go into effect.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: House Committee Finds Inconsistencies in Work of Financial Stability Panel\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14U.S. officials used a flawed and inconsistent process for investigating risks at large financial firms during the Obama administration, according to a report published Tuesday by Republicans on the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The report looks at private records of the \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2 , or FSOC, a group of senior regulators created after the financial crisis to look out for financial-system risks. The council has the authority to designate nonbank financial firms "systemically important," a label that comes with stricter regulation.\par \par \uc2 The FSOC is led by the Treasury secretary and includes representatives from other regulators.\par \par \uc2 Republicans on the committee reviewed the FSOC's analysis of nine companies and found it to be "inconsistent and arbitrary."\par \par \uc2 The findings suggest the council changed its approach depending on whether the officials involved wanted to designate a company "systemically important" or not, as opposed to evaluating each company using a consistent process. "The inconsistencies in the FSOC's analysis are not random; to a large degree the designated companies were evaluated in one fashion, and the non-designated companies were evaluated a different way," the report said.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House committee, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 A Treasury Department spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Just not when it comes to their corporate pensions.\par \par \uc2 Many German companies still operate huge traditional pension plans, which pay workers set sums after they retire. Yet thanks to permissive German pension regulation, the companies don't have to sequester cash to meet those future costs.\par \par \uc2 The results are ballooning pension deficits, thanks to persistently low interest rates, that critics call a time bomb for corporate Germany. At the end of October 2016, German companies listed on the blue-chip DAX index had pension obligations of \u8364\'20\'AC416 billion, yet had set aside just \u8364\'20\'AC245 billion, according to consulting firm Mercer. That ratio is far lower than in other major countries.\par \par \uc2 The German approach is "an unserious practice [and] a risky bet on the future," says Dieter Truxius, dean at the University of Mannheim Business School.\par \par \uc2 Standard & Poor's\uc2 , the ratings firm, in September revised its outlook for \uc2 Deutsche Lufthansa AG\uc2  to negative from stable, calling the enormous amount the airline owes current and future pensioners a "material credit weakness."\par \par \uc2 "It's a very important issue for \uc2 Lufthansa\uc2 ," said an airline spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Lufthansa\uc2 's pension obligations rose roughly 50% in the third quarter from the year earlier, to \u8364\'20\'AC10.5 billion, the spokesman said. \uc2 Lufthansa\uc2  is working to close its defined-benefit plans to new staff.\par \par \uc2 Germany's pension problem has been compounded by its rapidly aging population, meaning many workers on defined-benefit plans are approaching retirement.\par \par \uc2 "If low interest rates persist for a longer time, things could get tough when demographic shifts intensify," said Dieter Br\u228\'00\'E4uninger, a pensions specialist at Deutsche Bank.\par \par \uc2 Low rates are now deeply ensconced in Europe, unlike the U.S., where a gathering economic recovery and the prospect of fresh government spending by the new administration of President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  have boosted long-term bond yields. A 10-year \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  bond yields 2.3%; a 10-year German bond, just 0.2%.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S. and U.K., companies must squirrel away assets in special funds to cover pension liabilities. In France and many other countries, pensions are mainly government-managed.\par \par \uc2 In Germany, where private-sector employees get corporate pensions on top of state pensions, companies decide for themselves how much money to set aside and in what way. Many companies dole out pensions from their bank accounts, similar to paying electric bills.\par \par \uc2 Pension obligations are recorded as a liability on German-company balance sheets, but money isn't always set aside in a separate fund\u8212\'20\'14German companies take provisions for the part of their obligations that aren't funded, but those are simply accounting entries that can be undone.\par \par \uc2 Experts say this method flatters German companies in comparison with U.S. and U.K. peers. "Germany allows a financial flexibility to delay setting aside cash which can be fully reinvested to pursue strategic targets," said Kazim Razvi of \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Germany's system works well in good times, when retiree numbers are low, and for growing companies. "But if a company must shrink because its plan didn't work out, it gets tough," said Mr. Truxius.\par \par \uc2 A growing number of public companies\u8212\'20\'14especially large ones\u8212\'20\'14do set money aside in segregated investment vehicles. The blue chips listed on the DAX index have funding to cover 58% of their pension obligations, but that's around 20 percentage points below the international average, according to consultants Willis \uc2 Towers Watson\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Many Germans say the pension gap isn't concerning. Stephan Wildner, pensions specialist at Willis \uc2 Towers Watson\uc2  in Frankfurt, sees "no reason to panic."\par \par \uc2 "German companies have put enough money aside and are doing well economically," he said.\par \par \uc2 Heiko Massa-Wirth, a pensions expert at German steel producer Salzgitter AG, said the larger concern is mortality\u8212\'20\'14that former employees outlive expectations. That is the "real risk," he says, not low interest rates.\par \par \uc2 But persistent low rates make the edifice shaky. When interest rates are low, pension provisions grow because projected financial returns drop. Even if just an accounting matter, those growing liabilities eat into shareholder equity.\par \par \uc2 Thyssenkrupp AG\uc2 's mounting pension provisions have sapped shareholder equity by \u8364\'20\'AC2 billion over three years, said Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Guido Kerkhoff\uc2 . "Our book equity is to a large degree burdened by that."\par \par \uc2 Profitable firms can withstand that crunch, but higher provisions can batter smaller or chronically unprofitable firms.\par \par \uc2 Hardest hit by low rates are German midsize companies, who use different accounting rules that treat pension provisions more harshly.\par \par \uc2 EDC GmbH, a producer of CDs and DVDs, was forced to file for bankruptcy last year after falling behind new-technology rivals. It also faced the burden of higher pension obligations, said Uwe Rittentropp, the company's top staff representative.\par \par \uc2 "It was the straw that broke the camel's back," he said.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: BIS Chief Warns of Risk of Political Backlash Against Financial Globalization\par \par \uc2 By Brian Blackstone\par \par \uc2 ZURICH\u8212\'20\'14The head of the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2  warned Tuesday of "a clear and present risk" of a political backlash against global finance, though at this point any retreat from financial globalization appears restricted to Europe.\par \par \uc2 "It would be premature at the very least to declare that global financial integration has gone into reverse," said \uc2 Jaime Caruana\uc2 , general manager of the BIS, a consortium of central banks based in Switzerland. Still, he said, in prepared remarks to a conference in Geneva, that "we need answers for those who question the benefits of global financial integration."\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18It would be premature at the very least to declare that global financial integration has gone into reverse'\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Bank for International Settlements General Manager \uc2 Jaime Caruana\par \par \uc2 His remarks come as some political leaders and the public question the benefits of globalization in terms of international trade and finance. U.S. President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  has shelved a trans-Pacific trade agreement and wants to renegotiate an existing trade agreement the U.S. has with Mexico and Canada. Meanwhile, euroskeptic parties are on the rise in France, Italy and Germany.\par \par \uc2 Much of Mr. Caruana's comments addressed what he called "peak finance," the idea that "the world has seen the peak of global finance and that financial deglobalisation has begun."\par \par \uc2 Citing BIS data, he said that "the appearance of peak finance is more a feature of European banking than of global banking" with foreign assets held by banks based in the eurozone, U.K. and Switzerland declining but largely stable in other advanced economies relative to the size of their gross domestic product.\par \par \uc2 "The shrinkage of European banks' foreign claims in relation to activity reflects a needed deleveraging after unhealthy financial booms," Mr. Caruana said. Some of the slowdown in global finance was a consequence of the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when banks took steps to boost capital and in reduce assets.\par \par \uc2 Still, "even if the data show that financial deglobalisation is not happening, it is the case that pressures are building to push back financial globalization," he said. "We need to make the positive case for financial globalization\u8212\'20\'14though not for increasing global leverage."\par \par \uc2 European Lawmakers Vote for Tougher Anti-Money-Laundering Rules\par \par \uc2 By Julia-Ambra Verlaine\par \par \uc2 BRUSSELS\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 European Union\uc2  lawmakers voted Tuesday for tougher anti-money-laundering rules that would cover virtual currencies and prepaid cards as part of the bloc's fight against terror financing and a broader clamp down on tax avoidance.\par \par \uc2 The vote advances a proposal put forward in July by the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , the \uc2 EU\uc2 's executive arm. It would see the upper limit of nonreloadable prepaid cards lowered to \u8364\'20\'AC150 ($159) from \u8364\'20\'AC250 and virtual-currency platforms such as bitcoin brought under anti-money-laundering rules.\par \par \uc2 Terrorism across Europe brought heightened attention to prepaid cards, which the perpetrators of the November 2015 Paris attacks used.\par \par \uc2 "The behavior of criminals has not changed," said Kri\u353\'01\'61j\u257\'01\'01nis Kari\u326\'01\'46\u353\'01\'61, a Latvian member of the \uc2 EU Parliament\uc2  co-leading the anti-money-laundering review. "They use anonymity to launder their illicit proceeds or finance terrorism."\par \par \uc2 The rules also focus on fighting tax evasion, after the Panama Papers disclosures led to allegations that clients of Panama City-based law firm \uc2 Mossack Fonseca & Co\uc2 . were able to dodge sanctions and avoid taxes. \uc2 EU\uc2  member states would be required to create centralized registers of information about bank and payment-account holders, which national authorities could access in case of suspicious activities.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, tax authorities would gain access to national anti-money-laundering information, including the true owners of companies and trusts to prevent tax evasion by hiding funds offshore.\par \par \uc2 "Tax evasion and avoidance cause countries inside and outside Europe to miss out on billions of euros every year," said Sven Giegold, who speaks for the \uc2 EU\uc2 's Green Party on financial and economic issues. "Through a public register for companies and trusts, the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  wants to shed light on these structures in order to combat them."\par \par \uc2 The rules agreed by the parliament now require approval from national governments, one of the final steps in the \uc2 EU\uc2  legislative process.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in February, \uc2 EU\uc2  finance ministers agreed to measures to stop international corporations from cutting their tax bills\u8212\'20\'14another part of Europe's tax avoidance battle.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Banking Industry Annual Profit Hit Record in 2016\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The U.S. banking industry's total annual profit hit a record in 2016, and banks earned the highest return on equity they have seen in three years, according to government figures released Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . pegged the industry's 2016 net income at $171.3 billion, 4.9% more than the previous year. Profits were $43.7 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, up 7.7% from a year earlier. Only 4.2% of the nation's roughly 5,900 banks lost money in 2016, the lowest percentage in any year since 1995.\par \par \uc2 Banks' total profits are high in part because the size of their balance sheets and loan books are also at record levels. In percentage terms, the picture of the industry's health is more mixed.\par \par \uc2 Earnings as a share of banks' assets or equity haven't returned to levels reached before the financial crisis. Banks' return on assets was 1.04% in 2016, the same as the previous year, the \uc2 FDIC\uc2  said. Return on equity, a key measure of banks' profitability, rose to 9.32% industrywide last year, the highest since 2013, but less than the 10% figure many investors desire.\par \par \uc2 Loan growth also slowed in 2016, with balances up 5.3% during the year. Loans grew at a rate of 6.8% in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Banks' balance sheets are looking healthier, with noncurrent loans at their lowest average rate since 2007, the \uc2 FDIC\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 The Newest Bank Blockchain: Will This Be the Breakthrough?\par \par \uc2 By Paul Vigna\par \par \uc2 A new consortium of banks and tech giants was set to announce its formation Tuesday, the latest stab at expanding open-ledger "blockchain" technology that could shave billions off the cost of basic Wall Street functions.\par \par \uc2 The latest project, which was to be unveiled in Brooklyn, is called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The nonprofit foundation, which includes \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Intel Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Banco Santander SA\uc2 , shows the fight is continuing to develop the killer back-office app in finance, despite increased focus since last year's election on revenue growth.\par \par \uc2 So far, there has been more hype than tangible progress on blockchain at banks. The group announcing itself this week is building a platform based on an open-source software project \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  started last year called Quorum, which aims to eliminate the need for a costly infrastructure of middlemen and third parties overseeing transactions.\par \par \uc2 Quorum uses the core concepts behind blockchain, the open-ledger technology that underpins the digital currency bitcoin. But it is based on \uc2 Ethereum\uc2 , an alternative version of bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 Blockchains have been appealing to banks because they are networks of connected computers sharing the same database and record-keeping. That eliminates costs, but raises questions about how banks would handle proprietary information on such a transparent ledger.\par \par \uc2 The Ethereum Enterprise Alliance expects to launch a working version of its protocol, called EntEth 1.0, this year, and will be inviting developers to help build it out and build products on it. The goal is to create an open, flexible platform that would at the same time preserve some privacy for banks.\par \par \uc2 The alliance is a sign that the race to build out this technology on a large scale is heating up again. There have been a number of attempts over the past two years, but none have yet produced a working version. Many of the banks involved have more than one iron in the fire, in fact. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 , for example, is also a shareholder in startups \uc2 Digital Asset Holdings LLC\uc2  and Axoni, and also has some of its top coders working on Quorum.\par \par \uc2 Whichever group gets there first, a working blockchain-based network would be a big advantage for the financial-services industry. In January, the consulting firm \uc2 Accenture\uc2 , which also is part of the alliance, estimated that eight of the world's largest investment banks could realize an average of $10 billion in annual cost savings, by 2025, assuming blockchain technology reaches widespread use.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Telis Demos contributed this article.\par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Consulting firm \uc2 Accenture\uc2  estimated eight of the world's largest investment banks could realize an average of $10 billion in annual cost savings, by 2025, assuming blockchain technology reaches widespread use.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Medisafe Inc. on Wednesday will announce plans for expansion to London following an investment led by European-based \uc2 Octopus Ventures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The London firm led a $14.5 million Series B investment in the medication tracking app. M Ventures, the venture arm of the German pharmaceutical giant \uc2 Merck KGaA\uc2 , also participated in the round with existing investors \uc2 Pitango Venture Capital\uc2 , 7wire ventures, lool Ventures, TriVentures and \uc2 Qualcomm Ventures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Medisafe Chief Executive Omri Shor said he launched the company about five years ago in Israel after his father accidentally took two doses of his medication one day, including two rounds of his insulin shots. The app helps patients and caregivers track which medications they've taken and set reminder alarms to take pills.\par \par \uc2 With the Series B funding, the firm plans to open an office in London and expand its sales and marketing team.\par \par \uc2 The app has had 3.5 million users to date, who have recorded more than 500 million medication doses, the company said. Mr. Shor said the company will use the funding to hire more data scientists who can help pull insights from the data the company is collecting about medication use. He compared the app to the "biggest clinical trial."\par \par \uc2 "That data aspect is something that will create a lot of value for the industry," he said.\par \par \uc2 After Medisafe started as a consumer app, Mr. Shor said the company has begun seeing increased demand from commercial partners. Through partnerships, Medisafe helps health-care providers deliver content like medication videos to patients.\par \par \uc2 Medisafe is currently available on iOS and Android smartphones, tablets and some smartwatches, like the Apple Watch. Mr. Shor said some of the new funding would be used to help the company expand to new platforms, potentially even to devices like the \uc2 Amazon Inc\uc2 . Alexa.\par \par \uc2 Medisafe is compliant with HIPPA requirements and uses a level of encryption typically deployed by financial service providers to keep patient information secure.\par \par \uc2 "That's one of our biggest differentiators," Mr. Shor said. "Creating an app and putting it out there in a store is not that difficult."\par \par \uc2 Write to Cat Zakrzewski at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170301ed31003bm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BARCELONA -- Within 30 years, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will be smarter than the human brain.\par \par \uc2 That is according to \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , chief executive of SoftBank Group Corp., who says that supersmart robots will outnumber humans and more than a trillion objects will be connected to the internet within three decades.\par \par \uc2 These beliefs underpin the wave of large deals the Japanese internet and telecommunications company has pulled off in the past year, he said Monday. These include starting a $100 billion technology-investment fund with a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund, buying British microprocessor designer ARM Holdings PLC for $32 billion and acquiring U.S. asset manager Fortress Investment Group PLC for $3.3 billion.\par \par \uc2 This 30-year forecast created urgency, Mr. Son said in a speech at the telecom industry's biggest trade show, Mobile World Congress. "That is why I'm in a hurry to aggregate cash to invest."\par \par \uc2 In a brief interview after his speech, Mr. Son said his $100 billion project with the Saudis, dubbed the SoftBank Vision Fund, was bigger than the $65 billion in combined investments from the venture-capital world. He said the SoftBank Vision Fund would be focused.\par \par \uc2 "\b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Internet of Things, smart robots: Those are the three main things I'm interested in," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Internet of Things is the technology world's term for connecting everyday objects, such as refrigerators and sneakers, to the web.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son said he didn't expect oil company \uc2 Saudi Aramco\uc2 's planned initial public offering of stock to affect the size of Vision Fund. "They are a great partner," he said of the Saudis. "They're already rich. They have lots of money, even before the IPO."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son said this month's acquisition of \uc2 Fortress Investment\uc2  would complement the Vision Fund. "SoftBank Vision Fund is more for the technology," he said. "Fortress is for everything else -- traditional private equity and so on."\par \par \uc2 Fortress has about $70 billion in assets under management.\par \par \uc2 Combined with the Vision Fund, he said, "pretty soon we will have $200 billion together. So we would help each other to identify investment opportunities."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170228000016"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170228ed2s0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 BARCELONA -- Within 30 years, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will be smarter than the human brain.\par \par \uc2 That is according to \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , chief executive of SoftBank Group Corp., who says that supersmart robots will outnumber humans and more than a trillion objects will be connected to the internet within three decades.\par \par \uc2 These beliefs underpin the wave of large deals the Japanese internet and telecommunications company has pulled off in the past year, he said Monday. These include starting a $100 billion technology-investment fund with a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund, buying British microprocessor designer ARM Holdings PLC for $32 billion and acquiring U.S. asset manager Fortress Investment Group PLC for $3.3 billion.\par \par \uc2 This 30-year forecast created urgency, Mr. Son said in a speech at the telecom industry's biggest trade show, Mobile World Congress. "That is why I'm in a hurry to aggregate cash to invest."\par \par \uc2 In a brief interview after his speech, Mr. Son said his $100 billion project with the Saudis, dubbed the SoftBank Vision Fund, was bigger than the $65 billion in combined investments from the venture-capital world. He said the SoftBank Vision Fund would be focused. "\b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Internet of Things, smart robots: Those are the three main things I'm interested in," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Internet of Things is the technology world's term for connecting everyday objects, such as refrigerators and sneakers, to the web.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son said he didn't expect oil company \uc2 Saudi Aramco\uc2 's planned initial public offering of stock to affect the size of Vision Fund. "They are a great partner," he said of the Saudis. "They're already rich. They have lots of money, even before the IPO."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son said this month's unexpected acquisition of \uc2 Fortress Investment\uc2  would complement the Vision Fund. "SoftBank Vision Fund is more for the technology," he said. "Fortress is for everything else -- traditional private equity and so on. Money is money, you know?"\par \par \uc2 Fortress has about $70 billion in assets under management. Combined with the Vision Fund, he said, "pretty soon we will have $200 billion together. So we would help each other to identify investment opportunities and manage the portfolio companies."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son said he would also greatly increase the research-and-development funding for ARM, the British chip designer SoftBank bought in 2016. ARM doesn't manufacture chips, but it designs the basic architecture for the chips in more than 95% of the world's smartphones. Mr. Son said he believed that within 30 years, more than one trillion ARM-designed Internet of Things chips would be in use.\par \par \uc2 In his speech, Mr. Son said that while average humans had an IQ of roughly 100 and that geniuses such as Albert Einstein were believed to score about 200, superintelligent computers would have IQs of 10,000. He said computer chips possessing superintelligence would be put into robots big and small that can fly and swim. These robots would number in the billions and would be greater than the human population within 30 years, he said.\par \par \uc2 The chips would also be in everyday objects. "One of the chips in our shoes will be smarter than our brain," he said. "We will be less than our shoes, and we will be stepping on them."\par \par \uc2 During the brief interview after the speech, Mr. Son said he remained committed to stepping down from his job once he turned 70. He is 59 years old.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170228000013"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170228ed2s0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The idea was that it would buy out the overhang of bad loans that still debilitates too many European banks (the Italian banking system is the most worrying casualty). The idea was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-banks-regulations-germany-idUSKBN15F21G"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 swiftly smacked down }}}\uc2  by German \u8220\'20\'1Cgovernment sources\u8221\'20\'1D. But a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.centralbanking.com/central-banking-journal/opinion/2481794/why-the-eu-needs-an-asset-management-company"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 new opinion article }}}\uc2  by Enria\u8217\'20\'19s EBA colleagues, Piers Haben and Mario Quagliariello, shows that the proponents of the idea are not giving up without a fight. That is a good thing.\par \par \uc2 It is worth restating the simple policy reason to sequester bad loans and other toxic assets from banks\u8217\'20\'19 balance sheets. The value of such assets is uncertain, but plausibly much less than the accounting value. If their quantity is large enough, that means the solidity of the bank that holds them is in doubt. The possibility of lossmaking time-bombs lurking in its portfolio can both inhibit the bank itself from undertaking new risks, and may lead its own creditors to charge more for financing it. Both create pressure to retrench rather than lend more.\par \par \uc2 This needn\u8217\'20\'19t have wider importance if it\u8217\'20\'19s a single bank but it can hold back economic growth if it applies widely enough through an economy\u8217\'20\'19s banking system. A lending drought is the last thing an economy needs after the sort of crisis that typically causes widespread bad loans in the first place. Conversely, freeing up the banking sector to lend can power a recovery. By \u8220\'20\'1Cwarehousing\u8221\'20\'1D the loans in an entity that is not itself engaged in lending \u8212\'20\'14 often called a \u8220\'20\'1Cbad bank\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 that separate institution can take its time to liquidate the assets or let them run off to maturity. Crucially, those decisions will not be linked to decisions determining that availability of fresh credit in the economy.\par \par \uc2 Hence the policy imperative to clean out the rot from banks\u8217\'20\'19 balance sheets swiftly after a financial crisis. The US did this with more determination than Europe, which is part of why its recovery was stronger. On a smaller-scale comparison, Iceland\u8217\'20\'19s more radical approach to its banks led to results that compare favourably to Ireland\u8217\'20\'19s (and is a better explanation of the two countries\u8217\'20\'19 economic performance since 2008 than their different exchange rate regimes).\par \par \uc2 Why does it typically prove so difficult to do the right thing in this regard? Because removing bad assets from a bank means the losses have to be allocated. Either they are allocated with the bank, which is forced to write down the relevant assets to their fair value, or they are more or less explicitly taken on by the buyer of the assets who pays more than that fair value, leaving the selling bank with smaller losses. In the first case, the banks\u8217\'20\'19 solvency may be at risk, and it may have to be restructured or bailed out \u8212\'20\'14 neither a palatable choice for most politicians. In the latter case, taxpayer money will more or less surreptitiously be put at risk, given that the institution taking on the bad loans after a systemic crisis will most probably be a government-sponsored one.\par \par \uc2 Note, therefore, that a lot hinges on the price at which the bad assets are transferred out of the banking institution and into the \u8220\'20\'1Cwarehouse\u8221\'20\'1D in which it will be kept. This will always involve guesswork. But notice two things. If the price is close enough to fair value, it need not cost taxpayers (or whoever puts up the funds for the \u8220\'20\'1Cbad bank\u8221\'20\'1D) anything. And there is not just one but a range of prices where this is possible, because the bad assets\u8217\'20\'19 economic value for the bad bank should be higher than for the bank being weighed down by them.\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s because as a lender, the selling bank has stricter capital requirements than a pure asset management company so it faces a greater ongoing cost in holding on to them. It is also because an asset management company, having no other objectives and priorities, can time its asset disposals more profitably than a bank. And finally, in systemic crises, moving bad assets out of the banking system itself should improve credit and growth in the economy \u8212\'20\'14 which in turn should somewhat boost the value of the assets.\par \par \uc2 That leaves the question: why should the \u8220\'20\'1Cbad bank\u8221\'20\'1D be pan-European? Haben and Quagliariello give some good arguments relating to economies of scale and expertise, as well as the incontestable fact that the bad loan problem in some member states has affected growth in the region as a whole (and monetary policy effectiveness for the eurozone as a whole). It is politically difficult for them to emphasise the most important reason, which is this: a supranational bad bank is desirable because national governments have not been up to the job. That in itself is understandable \u8212\'20\'14 the national politics of forcing largely nationally focused banks to take losses is awful \u8212\'20\'14 if not forgivable. But the supranational regulatory structure that is emerging as part of Europe\u8217\'20\'19s banking union now has the power to push banks into selling off the assets that weight them down at an unsubsidised price. All that is needed, given the absence of a liquid market, is a buyer. If the \uc2 EU\uc2  heeds the EBA\u8217\'20\'19s advice, it will earn the gratitude of Europe\u8217\'20\'19s unemployed and underpaid.\par \par \uc2 Other readables\par \par \uc2 Researchers are examining whether {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nber.org/papers/w23180"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \\b artificial intelligence\\b0  might do better than human judges }}}\uc2  in deciding whether a defendant should await trial in jail or out on bail. They suggest huge improvement in policy could be had through \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CCrime can be reduced by up to 24.8 per cent with no change in jailing rates, or jail populations can be reduced by 42.0 per cent with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, we see reductions in all categories of crime, including violent ones. Importantly, such gains can be had while also significantly reducing the percentage of African-Americans and Hispanics in jail.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Machine bail decisions are not just science fiction, moreover: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/an-algorithm-is-replacing-bail-hearings-in-new-jersey"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 algorithms are already deciding }}}\uc2  for or against bail in New Jersey and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Numbers news\par \par \uc2 * French economic sentiment is buoyant.\par \par \uc2 To receive Martin Sandbu\u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/martin-sandbu-free-lunch"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Free Lunch }}}\uc2  by email every workday, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nbe.ft.com/nbe/profile.cfm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sign up here }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170227ed2r004ed\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Prosper Marketplace Inc\uc2 . struck a deal on Monday to sell up to $5 billion worth of consumer loans to a group of investment firms over the next two years.\par \par \uc2 Members of the group arranged by the online lender include \uc2 New Residential Investment Corp\uc2 , a real-estate investment trust managed by an affiliate of asset manager Fortress Investment Group LLC; hedge-fund firms \uc2 Soros Fund Management LLC\uc2  and \uc2 Third Point LLC\uc2 ; and the investment bank \uc2 Jefferies LLC\uc2 . The Wall Street Journal reported in August that the four firms in the consortium being announced Monday were in advanced talks with Prosper on a loan-buying deal.\par \par \uc2 The arrangement clears one of the biggest issues hanging over the San Francisco-based company, which was valued at $1.9 billion in an April 2015 fundraising round. A subsequent drying up of investor appetite for Prosper's credits caused loan volume to fall by around one-third in the first nine months of 2016, prompting the company to lay off staff and slash spending to conserve cash.\par \par \uc2 "The space was maybe hotter [among money managers] than the mechanics or fundamentals would have supported at the time," said Prosper CEO \uc2 David Kimball\uc2  in an interview Monday. "Now I think we're at a stage where there's just a little more of a thoughtful approach."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kimball, who took over the top job at Prosper late last year, said his focus was on getting the company to profitability. The bulk of Prosper's revenue comes from fees it charges borrowers to take out loans, so having a large commitment from money managers to fund loans helps ensure that revenue will be more sustainable.\par \par \uc2 That certainty won't come cheap, though. As part of the deal, the investor group will receive warrants to buy Prosper shares that are tied to the volume of loans that they buy at face value. If the group buys the full $5 billion, they would have the right to purchase shares representing 35% of the company, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Prosper said that the consortium of investors has also lined up financing for up to $1 billion of loan purchases from \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG\uc2 , \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 . Fintech \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company dv01 Inc. will serve as the consortium's loan data agent.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the deal talks, Prosper was advised by investment bank \uc2 Financial Technology Partners LP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2005, Prosper was originally structured as a peer-to-peer lender, but following a 2013 recapitalization, it began to look to Wall Street firms to fund more of the loans it made. Until last fall, one of its biggest sources of funding was \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 ., which packaged Prosper loans into bonds. That arrangement ended in April after Prosper executives indicated dissatisfaction about how the bonds were priced.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kimball said that he expected Prosper to launch its own securitization program, Prosper Marketplace Issuance Trust, in the second quarter. Loans that will underlie those bonds will likely come from the new investor group as well as other Prosper investors that want to fund their purchases in alternative ways.\par \par \uc2 Part of what delayed the deal's closing was a legal dispute between Prosper and another money manager, Colchis Capital Management, over the terms of an earlier loan-purchase agreement, Mr. Kimball said. In November, Prosper said it would pay Colchis $9 million in cash and warrants to purchase shares worth 7% of the company as part of a settlement.\par \par \uc2 Write to Peter Rudegeair at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Read More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-lender-prosper-in-talks-on-5-billion-loan-buying-deal-1470322065"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Online Lender Prosper in Talks on $5 Billion Loan-Buying Deal}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/incoming-ceo-of-online-lender-prosper-aims-to-reverse-drop-in-loan-activity-1479478592"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Incoming CEO of Online Lender Prosper Aims to Reverse Drop in Loan Activity}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosper-cuts-off-loan-deal-with-citigroup-1460483662"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Prosper Talks With Goldman, Others to Replace Citigroup on Loan Arrangement}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170227ed2r007bz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The firm, which started raising Nexxus Capital Mezzanine Fund this year, plans to hold a first closing for the vehicle by the middle of the year and a final closing by the end of 2017 or early 2018, said Roberto Terrazas de la Cerda, a Nexxus managing director and chief investor relations officer. The firm closed its latest fund, Nexxus Capital Private Equity Fund VI LP, in 2013 at $550 million. Nexxus invests primarily in consumer-focused sectors such as retail, restaurants and hospitality. It holds 10 companies in its current portfolio. As with its previous equity funds, Nexxus plans to raise its new mezzanine vehicle partially in Mexican pesos by issuing a certificate of development capital, or CKD, Mr. de la Cerda said. CKDs enable private-equity firms to collect capital from pension funds in Mexico. The firm intends to offer a CKD worth $200 million in May or June and to gather the remaining $100 million of its target through a dollar-denominated pool, he added.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170227ed2r008kd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The latest infusion was led by Silver Lake, the private equity firm, supported by SoftBank and GPI Capital, an asset manager, among others.\par \par \uc2 The valuation was undisclosed.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSoFi\u8217\'20\'19s platform \u8212\'20\'14 equal parts technology, community, and exceptional customer experience \u8212\'20\'14 is rapidly transforming personal finance,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Mike Bingle\uc2 , New York-based managing partner at Silver Lake, who is taking a seat on the board.\par \par \uc2 The six-year-old company, founded by \uc2 Mike Cagney\uc2  and a couple of his classmates from \uc2 Stanford Graduate School of Business\uc2 , began with refinancing student debt, recognising that there was a big gap between the interest rates good borrowers were paying on their loans from the government and the rates at which private investors were willing to lend to them.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cagney \u8212\'20\'14 a software engineer turned trader turned entrepreneur \u8212\'20\'14 has since branched out into mortgages, personal loans, insurance and wealth management. Last month he took another step in his quest to build a retail banking empire by buying Zenbanx, a provider of bank accounts, money transfers and credit cards.\par \par \uc2 Along the way, he has tried to foster a club-like mentality, hosting dinners and happy-hour mixers for his customers, whom he calls \u8220\'20\'1Cmembers\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 A person familiar with the latest fundraising said it should support SoFi\u8217\'20\'19s drive outside its home market, while allowing it to spend more on its basic mission of \u8220\'20\'1Cbuilding a bank in the cloud\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Many online lenders have had a tough time of it over the past year, as choppy credit markets, rising delinquencies and a governance scandal at \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  prompted many buyers of the platforms\u8217\'20\'19 loans to put programmes on hold. That, in turn, has caused several groups to cut back on generating assets, squeezing their bottom lines as revenues falter.\par \par \uc2 But in recent months institutional investors have begun to return, apparently convinced that the platforms have smartened up their acts. At \uc2 Lending Club\uc2 , for example, banks accounted for 31 per cent of loan volume in the fourth quarter, double their share of the third quarter, even as the company cut out special discounts.\par \par \uc2 Overall, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/promontory-interfinancial-network-clears-a-path-for-community-banks-to-purchase-sofi-loans-300403945.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 volumes  }}}\uc2  on consumer-loan platforms rose 10 per cent in the fourth quarter from the third, according to Orchard, a data and technology firm, breaking a three-quarter run of falls.\par \par \uc2 Last year SoFi originated $8bn of loans, it said on Friday, up from $5bn in 2015.\par \par \uc2 The company continues to home in on people in their 20s and 30s with good salaries and good prospects. Mr Cagney has called them \u8220\'20\'1CHenrys\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 short for \u8220\'20\'1Chigh-earning, not rich yet.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A $600m package of loans sold last month via the securitisation market was a good illustration of the target demographic: borrowers who owed an average of $75,000 had an average age of 34, a credit score of 764 \u8212\'20\'14 well into super-prime territory \u8212\'20\'14 and annual income of $170,000. The dominant schools were \uc2 New York University\uc2 , Michigan and \uc2 Penn State\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SoFi\u8217\'20\'19s focus on trying to service this high-achieving cohort by creating a strong sense of community may make it \u8220\'20\'1Cthe next \uc2 American Express\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D, said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of PeerIQ, an \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170912ed2p0066f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY\par {\*\bkmkstart toc19}{\*\bkmkend toc19}\b \uc2 The  \highlight22\uc2 big data \highlight\uc2  tech revolution set to shake up insurance\b0\par\par\uc2 By Oliver Ralph \par \uc2 2,362 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 February 2017\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 08\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Filling in forms to arrange cover for a car or health policy may become a thing of the past, as insurers - traditionally resistant to change - find new ways to assess risk, writes Oliver Ralph\par \par \uc2 Automatic razors, jet packs and traffic jams on the skyways. The Jetsons made all sorts of predictions about life in the distant future. But the HannaBarbera cartoon, made in the 1960s and 1980s, skipped over the question of insurance.\par \par \uc2 That is hardly surprising. Risk management is rarely a popular topic in science fiction. And in any case, the insurance industry has not always been quick to pick up on new technology. "The entire industry is focused on how life was lived five or 10 years ago," says \uc2 Andrew Brem\uc2 , chief digital officer at Aviva.\par \par \uc2 He is not the only one who feels that way. In a recent survey of insurers by broker Willis \uc2 Towers Watson\uc2 , 74 per cent of respondents felt the industry had failed to show leadership in digital innovation.\par \par \uc2 But change is coming as the industry wakes up to the idea that the cover we might buy 20 years from now will look very different from the cover we need today.\par \par \uc2 Big insurance companies are pouring millions into innovation and research. Mr Brem's company has set up what it calls a "digital garage" in Hoxton Square in east London to work on new ideas. \uc2 Axa\uc2  is putting more than \u8364\'20\'AC3bn into IT and digital developments. And others, from \uc2 Allianz\uc2  and \uc2 Munich Re\uc2  in Europe to Manulife in Canada and XL Catlin in Bermuda, are also investing heavily.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, billions more are going into so-called "insurtech" start-ups that are aiming to challenge the big players. The likes of So-sure, Friendsurance, Lemonade, Guevara, Brolly and a host of others are aiming to disrupt insurance in the same way that Uber, \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 , \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and Spotify have caused upheaval in other industries. According to CB Insights, $1.7bn went into insurance start-ups last year, across 173 deals.\par \par \uc2 "Insurance will be enormously different in the future," says Scott Walchek who runs Trov, an insurtech start-up that operates in Australia and the UK. "We're at the beginning of technology being applied to risk management."\par \par \uc2 How we buy\par \par \uc2 The first thing that could change over the next two decades is the way we buy insurance. Even with the development of price comparison sites and mobile apps, many people still find the experience time consuming and frustrating.\par \par \uc2 "Buying insurance is ridiculously retrograde, with endless questions resulting in a quote," says Mr Brem. "We'll be moving to a world where those questions are basically unnecessary. With the use of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , we are discovering interesting and accurate predictors of risk that do not involve asking people questions."\par \par \uc2 One example already in use is the way that Aviva prices its car insurance. Traditionally, this involved a lot of questions about the type of car, the location and the driving history. But the company has found a statistical link between the purchase of life insurance policies and safer driving. So life insurance policyholders get lower quotes.\par \par \uc2 This idea is likely to grow over the next couple of decades. "Not far into the future, the power of the data will mean that people who look the same [to an insurer] now will no longer look the same," says Mr Brem.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are already experimenting with this. Last year, Admiral wanted to use the language used in \uc2 Facebook\uc2  posts to gauge how dangerously a person would drive. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  got cold feet over the experiment, but industry experts say that other insurers are likely to try to use data in similarly innovative ways to assess risk.\par \par \uc2 The result, say insurtech enthusiasts, will be a system that accurately prices risk without burdening the buyer with cumbersome, time-consuming questionnaires. In the Willis \uc2 Towers Watson\uc2  survey, 94 per cent of respondents said that distribution would be the area where technology would make the biggest difference over the next five years.\par \par \uc2 What we buy\par \par \uc2 What we choose to cover, and how we choose to cover it, is also likely to change radically. Today, we buy car insurance, home insurance and travel insurance that is much the same as it was a couple of decades ago, except that we can now buy online as well as via a broker.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Walchek believes the policies of the future will bear little resemblance to those of today.\par \par \uc2 "We still own things that we want to protect and we take risks with them," he says. "What has changed is that life and its risk is being ever more precisely measured. In the past, for example, you might use a postcode to give you an indication of risk. Now it is being measured in feet and inches."\par \par \uc2 Imagine that mobile phone signals or other sensors detect that a person is about to walk down a road where several people have recently fallen on ice, he says. The insurer will react by either sending a message warning the person to walk more carefully or else automatically increase the premium and cover while the policyholder is walking down that road.\par \par \uc2 In the shorter term, more precision is likely to mean that insurance will be broken down into easier to digest chunks. The days of the annual policy may be numbered.\par \par \uc2 Trov is already offering coverage for specific items for limited periods of time. Customers can buy insurance covering a camera for a day, for example.\par \par \uc2 The same principle is being applied to car insurance, where a common complaint is that, thanks to annual policies, people are paying to insure cars that spend most of their lives sitting in car parks or driveways. Being able to switch policies on and off, the argument goes, will make them much more attractive to occasional users. Cuvva in the UK and Metromile in the US are among those offering pared-down policies.\par \par \uc2 But not everyone thinks this model will have universal appeal. "The consumer has to make the decision," says Murray Raisbeck, an insurance technology specialist at KPMG. "But consumers don't really want to think about their insurance."\par \par \uc2 Andrew Rear, chief executive of \uc2 Munich Re\uc2  Digital Partners, agrees. "I can't see people wanting to turn their insurance on and off. But one of the things that's interesting about atomisation is that the customer doesn't have to turn the insurance on and off. You can make a decision that you want insurance when you are doing X, and the machine decides when you are doing X [and so switches the cover on]."\par \par \uc2 Another possibility is that we will be insuring things that, currently, we do not insure at all.\par \par \uc2 "Over the long term what we'll see is a shift in insurance premiums," says Mr Rear. "You see risks going down in areas where sensor technology can make a difference and help to reduce risk and reduce premiums, but you also get new risks and new sectors that need insuring."\par \par \uc2 Digital data are one example. "There are virtual assets such as images, or collections of items in games," says Mr Brem. "The digital world is creating a lot of new types of assets."\par \par \uc2 At the moment, cyber insurance tends to be a corporate policy, covering companies for the consequences of a data breach, for example. But, given the amount of personal data that is now held digitally, some insurers are starting to look at the question of whether there would be a market for personal cyber cover.\par \par \uc2 On the road\par \par \uc2 It is not all a question of buying more insurance. In some areas we may find that we need less. Car insurance is one of them.\par \par \uc2 The question of how to insure driverless cars is the subject of much debate in the industry. If a car has an accident in driverless mode, who is responsible? The latest government proposals suggest that car owners will buy a single policy much as they do now, and the insurer will be able to claim from the manufacturer if it turns out that the car was at fault.\par \par \uc2 Over the long term, however, the nature of driving could change dramatically. At a recent conference on insuring autonomous vehicles, Lukas Neckermann, a consultant, predicted that: "Over the next five to 10 years, we will move to a point where we don't need to own or drive a car and we'll have mobility on demand. The classes and types of vehicles are going to change significantly to classes that the insurers are not familiar with yet."\par \par \uc2 That, in turn, will change the nature of car insurance. "Personal motor insurance will decline but fleet insurance will increase," says Mr Raisbeck. "The manufacturers of vehicles may be the providers of insurance."\par \par \uc2 Prevention not cure\par \par \uc2 One of the big benefits of autonomous cars is expected to be a reduction in accidents. David Williams, technical director at Axa, says that 90 per cent of accidents are caused by driver error. Fewer accidents should mean fewer insurance claims and hence cheaper insurance. Companies using in-car telematics, such as Insure the Box and Carrot, already try to encourage their policyholders to drive more safely.\par \par \uc2 Many in the industry hope that a similar principle will start to apply elsewhere. They hope that by using technology, insurers can advise policyholders how to avoid incidents and hence cut the number of claims. The insurer, they hope, will change from being purely a source of claims payments to a trusted adviser.\par \par \uc2 Alerting the person about to walk down an icy road would be one example of this. But others are already available.\par \par \uc2 "This has been talked about for a while, but we're at a tipping point, for example with connected homes," says Mr Brem. "I have something called a leakbot at home which tells me if it thinks there may be a leak."\par \par \uc2 Giving insurers access to vast swaths of personal data is not for everyone, and some companies may offer policies that require less information. But that could carry a financial cost - the less insurers know about the risks they have to cover, the more they will charge for providing that cover.\par \par \uc2 The progress of telematics policies in car insurance offers an example. Many younger drivers, who can save by allowing insurers to see their driving data, are happy to sign up to telematics policies. However, for older drivers the savings may be less significant because the insurance companies already know a lot about how likely they are to make a claim, and the market for telematics among older drivers has not really taken off.\par \par \uc2 Health is one area where the potential for monitoring technology is moving ahead fast. South African insurer Discovery, creator of the Vitality programme , uses devices such as Fitbits or other activity trackers to encourage its health insurance customers to exercise more. The more they exercise, the fitter they are and so the cheaper the insurance.\par \par \uc2 "There's an imbalance - healthcare is over-consumed, and wellness is under-consumed," says \uc2 Adrian Gore\uc2 , chief executive of Discovery. "We pioneered the idea of incentivised wellness a decade ago. Now it is part of health policy. There's been a massive change. It's about trying to understand risk factors better, trying to incentivise behavioural change and making the healthcare system more personalised."\par \par \uc2 In the future, he says, insurers may be able to use genetic data to help tailor health plans for each person, although he warns that the same data should not be used as a way of pricing policies.\par \par \uc2 The far future\par \par \uc2 In the dim and distant future, Mr Brem believes we may not even have to think about insurance for individual items. "Our industry has created a false separation between different types of insurance. That is not how I think about my life. I'd like to have a single relationship that I can tailor. I'd like the insurance company to say 'I'm going to evaluate you and here is our recommendation across the piece with a single premium you pay every month'."\par \par \uc2 Mr Walchek agrees: "There will be a rich brew of data that identifies risk in real time. That changes the way insurance works. Maybe there's a single insurance policy that goes with you at all times - call it a halo - and covers all kinds of risks. The distinction between risks diminishes."\par \par \uc2 How very Jetsons.\par \par \uc2 Another way\par \par \uc2 Peer-to-peer insurance harks back to the past\par \par \uc2 There is an alternative view of the future of insurance. Rather than using \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  to price everybody's risk individually, there is a school of thought that insurance will return to its roots where small groups of people get together to pool their risks.\par \par \uc2 The modern name for this old concept is peer-to-peer insurance . One major benefit is expected to be a reduction of fraud - people are less likely to put in bogus claims if they think they are hurting their friends, or causes they care about.\par \par \uc2 US newcomer Lemonade is one of the highest-profile promoters of the idea. It provides home insurance for the rental market, but customers are grouped together by selecting a charity. The premiums of each group go into a pot at the start of the year. Whatever is left at the end goes to the charity. Lemonade launched last September and says that it now has more than 2,200 policies.\par \par \uc2 Lots of others are working on similar models, including Guevara, So-sure, Friendsurance, Inspeer and Tongjubao. Their models vary. For example, some companies use the money left at the end to reduce premiums for the following year.\par \par \uc2 Murray Raisbeck, an insurance technology specialist at KPMG, says that there are limits to the model. "If someone can create a platform that allows lots of peer-to-peer niches to emerge then it can work. But individual peer-to-peer pools break down when they get over a couple of hundred people. You need a deep trust between the people in the pool."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170225ed2p0002f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The Jetsons made all sorts of predictions about life in the distant future. But the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, made in the 1960s and 1980s, skipped over the question of insurance.\par \par \uc2 That is hardly surprising. Risk management is rarely a popular topic in science fiction. And in any case, the insurance industry has not always been quick to pick up on new technology. \u8220\'20\'1CThe entire industry is focused on how life was lived five or 10 years ago,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Andrew Brem\uc2 , chief digital officer at Aviva.\par \par \uc2 He is not the only one who feels that way. In a recent survey of insurers by broker Willis \uc2 Towers Watson\uc2 , 74 per cent of respondents felt the industry had failed to show leadership in digital innovation.\par \par \uc2 But change is coming as the industry wakes up to the idea that the cover we might buy 20 years from now will look very different from the cover we need today.\par \par \uc2 Big insurance companies are pouring millions into innovation and research. Mr Brem\u8217\'20\'19s company has set up what it calls a \u8220\'20\'1Cdigital garage\u8221\'20\'1D in Hoxton Square in east London to work on new ideas. \uc2 Axa\uc2  is putting more than \u8364\'20\'AC3bn into IT and digital developments. And others, from \uc2 Allianz\uc2  and \uc2 Munich Re\uc2  in Europe to Manulife in Canada and XL Catlin in Bermuda, are also investing heavily.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, billions more are going into so-called \u8220\'20\'1Cinsurtech\u8221\'20\'1D start-ups which are aiming to challenge the big players. The likes of So-sure, Friendsurance, Lemonade, Guevara, Brolly and a host of others are aiming to disrupt insurance in the same way that Uber, \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 , \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and Spotify have caused upheaval in other industries. According to CB Insights, $1.7bn went into insurance start-ups last year, across 173 deals.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CInsurance will be enormously different in the future,\u8221\'20\'1D says Scott Walchek who runs Trov, an insurtech start-up that operates in Australia and the UK. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re at the beginning of technology being applied to risk management.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 How we buy\par \par \uc2 The first thing that could change over the next two decades is the way we buy insurance. Even with the development of price comparison sites and mobile apps, many people still find the experience time consuming and frustrating.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBuying insurance is ridiculously retrograde, with endless questions resulting in a quote,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Brem. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ll be moving to a world where those questions are basically unnecessary. With the use of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , we are discovering interesting and accurate predictors of risk that do not involve asking people questions.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 One example already in use is the way that Aviva prices its car insurance. Traditionally, this involved a lot of questions about the type of car, the location and the driving history. But the company has found a statistical link between the purchase of life insurance policies and safer driving. So life insurance policyholders get lower quotes.\par \par \uc2 This idea is likely to grow over the next couple of decades. \u8220\'20\'1CNot far into the future, the power of the data will mean that people who look the same [to an insurer] now will no longer look the same,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Brem.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are already experimenting with this. Last year, Admiral wanted to use the language used in \uc2 Facebook\uc2  posts to gauge how dangerously a person would drive. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  got cold feet over the experiment, but industry experts say that other insurers are likely to try to use data in similarly innovative ways to assess risk.\par \par \uc2 The result, say insurtech enthusiasts, will be a system that accurately prices risk without burdening the buyer with cumbersome, time-consuming questionnaires. In the Willis \uc2 Towers Watson\uc2  survey, 94 per cent of respondents said that distribution would be the area where technology would make the biggest difference over the next five years.\par \par \uc2 What we buy\par \par \uc2 What we choose to cover, and how we choose to cover it, is also likely to change radically. Today, we buy car insurance, home insurance and travel insurance that is much the same as it was a couple of decades ago, except that we can now buy online as well as via a broker.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Walchek believes the policies of the future will bear little resemblance to those of today.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe still own things that we want to protect and we take risks with them,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat has changed is that life and its risk is being ever more precisely measured. In the past, for example, you might use a postcode to give you an indication of risk. Now it is being measured in feet and inches.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Imagine that mobile phone signals or other sensors detect that a person is about to walk down a road where several people have recently fallen on ice, he says. The insurer will react by either sending a message warning the person to walk more carefully or else automatically increase the premium and cover while the policyholder is walking down that road.\par \par \uc2 In the shorter term, more precision is likely to mean that insurance will be broken down into easier to digest chunks. The days of the annual policy may be numbered.\par \par \uc2 Trov is already offering coverage for specific items for limited periods of time. Customers can buy insurance covering a camera for a day, for example.\par \par \uc2 The same principle is being applied to car insurance, where a common complaint is that, thanks to annual policies, people are paying to insure cars that spend most of their lives sitting in car parks or driveways. Being able to switch policies on and off, the argument goes, will make them much more attractive to occasional users. Cuvva in the UK and Metromile in the US are among those offering pared-down policies.\par \par \uc2 But not everyone thinks this model will have universal appeal. \u8220\'20\'1CThe consumer has to make the decision,\u8221\'20\'1D says Murray Raisbeck, an insurance technology specialist at KPMG. \u8220\'20\'1CBut consumers don\u8217\'20\'19t really want to think about their insurance.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Andrew Rear, chief executive of \uc2 Munich Re\uc2  Digital Partners, agrees. \u8220\'20\'1CI can\u8217\'20\'19t see people wanting to turn their insurance on and off. But one of the things that\u8217\'20\'19s interesting about atomisation is that the customer doesn\u8217\'20\'19t have to turn the insurance on and off. You can make a decision that you want insurance when you are doing X, and the machine decides when you are doing X [and so switches the cover on].\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Another possibility is that we will be insuring things that, currently, we do not insure at all.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COver the long term what we\u8217\'20\'19ll see is a shift in insurance premiums,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Rear. \u8220\'20\'1CYou see risks going down in areas where sensor technology can make a difference and help to reduce risk and reduce premiums, but you also get new risks and new sectors that need insuring.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Digital data are one example. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are virtual assets such as images, or collections of items in games,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Brem. \u8220\'20\'1CThe digital world is creating a lot of new types of assets.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 At the moment, cyber insurance tends to be a corporate policy, covering companies for the consequences of a data breach, for example. But, given the amount of personal data that is now held digitally, some insurers are starting to look at the question of whether there would be a market for personal cyber cover.\par \par \uc2 On the road\par \par \uc2 It is not all a question of buying more insurance. In some areas we may find that we need less. Car insurance is one of them. The question of how to insure driverless cars is the subject of much debate in the industry. If a car has an accident in driverless mode, who is responsible? The latest government proposals suggest that car owners will buy a single policy much as they do now, and the insurer will be able to claim from the manufacturer if it turns out that the car was at fault.\par \par \uc2 Over the long term, however, the nature of driving could change dramatically. At a recent conference on insuring autonomous vehicles, Lukas Neckermann, a consultant, predicted that: \u8220\'20\'1COver the next five to 10 years, we will move to a point where we don\u8217\'20\'19t need to own or drive a car and we\u8217\'20\'19ll have mobility on demand. The classes and types of vehicles are going to change significantly to classes that the insurers are not familiar with yet.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 That, in turn, will change the nature of car insurance. \u8220\'20\'1CPersonal motor insurance will decline but fleet insurance will increase,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Raisbeck. \u8220\'20\'1CThe manufacturers of vehicles may be the providers of insurance.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Prevention not cure\par \par \uc2 One of the big benefits of autonomous cars is expected to be a reduction in accidents. David Williams, technical director at Axa, says that 90 per cent of accidents are caused by driver error. Fewer accidents should mean fewer insurance claims and hence cheaper insurance. Companies using in-car telematics, such as Insure the Box and Carrot, already try to encourage their policyholders to drive more safely.\par \par \uc2 Many in the industry hope that a similar principle will start to apply elsewhere. They hope that by using technology, insurers can advise policyholders how to avoid incidents and hence cut the number of claims. The insurer, they hope, will change from being purely a source of claims payments to a trusted adviser.\par \par \uc2 Alerting the person about to walk down an icy road would be one example of this. But others are already available.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis has been talked about for a while, but we\u8217\'20\'19re at a tipping point, for example with connected homes,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Brem. \u8220\'20\'1CI have something called a leakbot at home which tells me if it thinks there may be a leak.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Giving insurers access to vast swaths of personal data is not for everyone, and some companies may offer policies that require less information. But that could carry a financial cost \u8212\'20\'14 the less insurers know about the risks they have to cover, the more they will charge for providing that cover.\par \par \uc2 The progress of telematics policies in car insurance offers an example. Many younger drivers, who can save by allowing insurers to see their driving data, are happy to sign up to telematics policies. However, for older drivers the savings may be less significant because the insurance companies already know a lot about how likely they are to make a claim, and the market for telematics among older drivers has not really taken off.\par \par \uc2 Health is one area where the potential for monitoring technology is moving ahead fast. South African insurer Discovery, creator of the Vitality programme, uses devices such as Fitbits or other activity trackers to encourage its health insurance customers to exercise more. The more they exercise, the fitter they are and so the cheaper the insurance.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s an imbalance \u8212\'20\'14 healthcare is over-consumed, and wellness is under-consumed,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Adrian Gore\uc2 , chief executive of Discovery. \u8220\'20\'1CWe pioneered the idea of incentivised wellness a decade ago. Now it is part of health policy. There\u8217\'20\'19s been a massive change. It\u8217\'20\'19s about trying to understand risk factors better, trying to incentivise behavioural change and making the healthcare system more personalised.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In the future, he says, insurers may be able to use genetic data to help tailor health plans for each person, although he warns that the same data should not be used as a way of pricing policies.\par \par \uc2 The far future\par \par \uc2 In the dim and distant future, Mr Brem believes we may not even have to think about insurance for individual items. \u8220\'20\'1COur industry has created a false separation between different types of insurance. That is not how I think about my life. I\u8217\'20\'19d like to have a single relationship that I can tailor. I\u8217\'20\'19d like the insurance company to say \u8216\'20\'18I\u8217\'20\'19m going to evaluate you and here is our recommendation across the piece with a single premium you pay every month\u8217\'20\'19.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Walchek agrees: \u8220\'20\'1CThere will be a rich brew of data that identifies risk in real time. That changes the way insurance works. Maybe there\u8217\'20\'19s a single insurance policy that goes with you at all times \u8212\'20\'14 call it a halo \u8212\'20\'14 and covers all kinds of risks. The distinction between risks diminishes.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 How very Jetsons.\par \par \uc2 Phone a friend\par \par \uc2 There is an alternative view of the future of insurance. Rather than using \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  to price everybody\u8217\'20\'19s risk individually, there is a school of thought that says insurance will return to its roots where small groups of people get together to pool their risks.\par \par \uc2 The modern name for this old concept is peer-to-peer insurance. One of the main benefits is expected to be a reduction of fraud \u8212\'20\'14 people are less likely to put in bogus claims if they think they are hurting their friends, or causes they care about.\par \par \uc2 US newcomer Lemonade is one of the highest profile promoters of the idea. It provides home insurance for the rental market, but customers are grouped together by selecting a charity. The premiums of each group go into a pot at the start of the year. Whatever is left at the end goes to the charity. Lemonade launched last September and says that it already has more than 2,200 policies.\par \par \uc2 Lots of others are working on similar models, including Guevara, So-sure, Friendsurance, Inspeer and Tongjubao. The models they are using vary. For example, the money left at the end does not always go to a charity. Some companies use it to reduce premiums for the following year.\par \par \uc2 One thing that unites most, however, is using the peer-to-peer concept to reduce the mistrust that has often existed between insurers and policyholders.\par \par \uc2 Mr Raisbeck says that there are limits to the model. \u8220\'20\'1CIf someone can create a platform that allows lots of peer to peer niches to emerge then it can work. But individual peer to peer pools break down when they get over a couple of hundred people. You need a deep trust between the people in the pool.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170224ed2o001bp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

As relations between the new administration and China take hold, however, there are several areas that Mr. Trump has yet to recognize publicly as sore points for the U.S. One of them: Wall Street firms' limited access to China's financial sector.\par \par \uc2 China joined the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  in 2001. After a five-year grace period, the country was supposed to open its doors wider to foreign banks. While that happened on paper, in reality rules have made it difficult for foreign banks to penetrate the market. The share of foreign banking operations amounted to just 1.4% of China's total banking assets in 2015, according the \uc2 China Banking Regulatory Commission\uc2 . It was 2.4% in 2007.\par \par \uc2 In practice, foreign banks must create separate companies to operate in China and face difficulties opening branches.\par \par \uc2 "As a result, foreign banks have almost no retail banking business, and they can't utilize their more efficient banking services to compete head to head against China's own banks," said \uc2 Scott Kennedy\uc2  of the \uc2 Center for Strategic and International Studies\uc2 , a Washington think tank. "There are similar constraints still in place for the securities business, credit ratings, insurance and credit cards."\par \par \uc2 Discussions about a bilateral investment treaty started in 2008 and have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-vows-to-cut-red-tape-to-boost-foreign-investment-1475993079"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dragged on}}}\uc2  without a deal. It isn't clear whether such talks will continue under Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, repeated assurances by Chinese regulators to allow the world greater access to the country's finance industry are getting stale.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 National Development and Reform Commission{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-ease-curbs-on-foreign-investment-in-finance-1483094113"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 made such a promise}}}\uc2  in December. Then, the State Council said it would ease investment curbs, including in banking, securities, futures, fund management and insurance. Its statement was published Jan. 17, the same day President \uc2 Xi Jinping{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinping-in-davos-making-the-most-of-a-waning-era-1484560806"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 took to the stage}}}\uc2  at the \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  in Davos, Switzerland. Critics quickly pointed out the irony of an economic nationalist declaring China's openness to the world.\par \par \uc2 Beijing has kept its finance sector well protected because banks are its major conduit for implementing economic policy. By and large, funds flow to China's corporate sector through state-owned banks, not the securities market.\par \par \uc2 A foreign commercial bank can own up to 25% of a domestic commercial bank, while a foreign investment bank can own up to 49% of a securities joint venture. For example, \uc2 HSBC Holdings PLC\uc2  has a 19.9% stake in Bank of Communications Co., while \uc2 UBS Group AG\uc2  and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  have been {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-and-ubs-to-increase-stakes-in-mainland-china-joint-ventures-1483883686"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 looking to increase stakes}}}\uc2  in their securities joint ventures to 49%, from about 25% and about 33%, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Other areas of finance are up for review. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-underwhelms-with-market-opening-plan-1481196590"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A December draft}}}\uc2  of revised rules for opening up markets loosened restrictions on the credit-rating industry.\par \par \uc2 Currently, foreign firms can rate domestic securities only through joint ventures\u8212\'20\'14something the likes of \uc2 Moody's Investors Service\uc2 , \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  and S&P Global Ratings have been reluctant to do.\par \par \uc2 Most China observers aren't hopeful about meaningful change to the finance sector, given that Mr. Trump has focused his complaints toward China on its trade and currency practices.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see China taking a pre-emptive action to further open up its banking market to foreign banks at this stage, given already heightened trade tensions, particularly with the U.S." said Matthew Phillips, a Hong Kong-based financial-services partner at PwC. "Trade is going to drive the dynamic between the two countries and until China sees the lay of the land, it might not want to show its hand and further open access to a critical area."\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Trump Team Broadens Search for Fed Regulatory Post\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy and Andrew Ackerman\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The Trump administration has broadened its search for a key regulatory job at the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , according to people familiar with the matter, meeting in recent weeks with at least two people about the post of Fed vice chair in charge of bank oversight.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  hasn't announced who he will nominate to the currently vacant post, and his decision won't be final until that happens. He also has at least two other seats on the Fed's seven-member board to fill. One of those is currently vacant, and the other will be open once Fed governor \uc2 Daniel Tarullo\uc2 , currently the de facto chief of bank oversight, resigns in early April.\par \par \uc2 The administration is still said to be considering \uc2 David Nason\uc2 , a former Treasury Department official in the administration of President George W. Bush and currently an executive in the financing arm of \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 . Mr. Nason had emerged as the front-runner for the job weeks ago, people familiar with the matter said at the time.\par \par \uc2 President Trump's team also recently met with \uc2 Richard Davis\uc2 , the chief executive of U.S. Bancorp, and \uc2 Hal Scott\uc2 , a professor at Harvard Law School, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mr. Davis, responding to an inquiry on Thursday, said "Richard is not a candidate for the Fed position. He is focused on a successful CEO transition in April." \uc2 U.S. Bank\uc2  said in January Mr. Davis will be stepping down from the CEO role in April, while remaining on as executive chairman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scott declined to comment. The White House had no immediate comment. A GE spokeswoman had no comment.\par \par \uc2 The meetings provide more evidence the administration is looking at candidates who will take a less aggressive regulatory posture than the Fed did under the Obama administration, in line with the desire of Mr. Trump and his advisers to pare back regulations spurred by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scott has publicly criticized some of the Fed's regulatory moves, for instance by suggesting capital requirements are too strict and calling on the central bank to disclose more about its annual "stress tests" of banks' resilience and "living wills" that outline how they would fail without taxpayer support. He is director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a group of financial industry representatives and academics that comments on regulatory policy, often in ways critical of the Fed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Davis has been chief executive of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank since 2006. His bank, one of the country's largest, has dealt with many of the new rules and stricter enforcement under the Obama administration, though he hasn't railed against them in public as strongly as some other bankers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Nason, for his part, appears to be getting a push from people with access to the highest levels of the administration.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Mr. Trump was meeting with manufacturing CEOs at the White House. As the group was waiting for the president within earshot of reporters, \uc2 Jeffrey Immelt\uc2 , chief executive of GE, greeted Treasury Secretary \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2  and said, "Secretary, just wanted to tell you \uc2 Dave Nason\uc2  is a great guy."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Nick Timiraos and Ted Mann contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Treasury's Mnuchin Raises Concerns Over Bank Lending, Liquidity\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Treasury Secretary \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2  raised concerns about banks' ability to meet lending demands on Thursday, suggesting rules affecting bank holdings of cash and securities could be in the Trump administration's crosshairs.\par \par \uc2 "There's an extraordinary amount of liquidity trapped in the system at banks," Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on \uc2 Fox Business Network\uc2 , echoing a comment he made on CNBC earlier in the day. "We're all for banks being highly regulated but we want to make sure that banks are lending. That is the No. 1 priority for us."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin didn't specify which rules he was blaming for the problem he perceived. Regulators have adopted several new rules targeting banks' balance sheets in recent years, an effort to prevent them from taking the outsize risks that had destabilized large firms during the financial crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin doesn't have final say over regulatory policy, but he is helping to pick the officials who will.\par \par \uc2 One set of rules, including the so-called liquidity coverage ratio, forces large banks to hold a minimum amount of cash or securities that could be quickly sold, so they would be able to pay their bills in the event of a sudden credit crunch. The restriction means banks can't dedicate that cash to loans or other investments, a downside regulators have so far been willing to accept in the name of a safer financial system.\par \par \uc2 The Volcker rule, which bans banks from trading for their own account, has also been blamed for affecting market liquidity, or the ability of investors to buy and sell securities quickly at a desired price. Critics say the rule is a big reason why banks have reduced their trading activity, while defenders of the rule point to other factors, such as the rise of electronic trading by non-bank firms.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin has criticized the Volcker rule in the past and did so again in the Fox interview, saying it has "hurt liquidity" and that policy makers need to clarify the definition of banned trading.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, an official at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York\uc2  signaled in a speech Thursday an openness to discussing whether post-crisis rules have struck the right balance between safety and economic growth.\par \par \uc2 "In my view, it is entirely appropriate to continuously evaluate and rigorously assess the impact to ensure that the observed outcomes are consistent with stated objectives, such as greater resilience, efficient financial intermediation over time, and financial stability," said Kevin Stiroh, the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2 's head of supervision.\par \par \uc2 He pointed specifically to liquidity and capital rules, which he said can increase banks' safety while reducing their ability to provide financial services. "A firm holding a large buffer of low-return, highly liquid assets might be stronger from a liquidity perspective, but might have less lending capacity," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stiroh also defended post-crisis rules, saying the financial system is much more resilient than it used to be.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  doesn't have final say over rules for banks, but it enforces regulations adopted in Washington and participates in the development of new rules.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Regulators Issue Guidance Aimed at Robo Investment Advisers\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 U.S. market regulators on Thursday issued their first set of guidelines aimed at robo advisers, a burgeoning class of money managers that have sometimes come under fire for whether they're sufficiently clear about how their platforms work.\par \par \uc2 Robo advisers such as \uc2 Betterment LLC\uc2  and Wealthfront Inc. use algorithms to analyze a client's demographic profile and investment goals in order to build a portfolio for them. Humans aren't involved in picking assets and, as a result, the firms can undercut other brokers and money managers by selling their services at a lower cost.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , in guidance issued Thursday, said lack of human interaction means robo advisers should take special care to disclose how they operate, including whether they can cut off clients' ability to trade during bouts of market turmoil. Betterment faced criticism last year for suspending all trading for institutional customers during the mayhem that followed the U.K.'s decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "As technology continues to improve and make profound changes to the financial services industry, it's important for regulators to assess its impact on U.S. markets and give thoughtful guidance to market participants," said \uc2 SEC\uc2  Acting Chairman Michael Piwowar.\par \par \uc2 Betterment, which manages $7.8 billion in assets, has said it halted trading to protect investors from paying higher transaction costs associated with buying and selling securities when volatility spikes. Some Betterment clients said they weren't informed about the halt. The firm has updated a required regulatory disclosure to provide greater detail around its trading discretion.\par \par \uc2 "We appreciate the \uc2 SEC\uc2 's thoughtful and rigorous analysis of the space," said Betterment spokesman \uc2 Joe Ziemer\uc2 . "We think there is valuable guidance for the companies providing these types of services and for investors considering them."\par \par \uc2 Investors who use robo advisers typically answer brief questionnaires that provide the firm with factors on which to base a diversified portfolio. But sometimes clients provide inconsistent answers, and not all firms try to resolve that, the \uc2 SEC\uc2  said. The \uc2 SEC\uc2  said robo advisers might want to use "alerts" to inform investors when their answers conflict.\par \par \uc2 Robo advisers may also need to implement policies that help detect and protect against cybersecurity threats, the \uc2 SEC\uc2  said..\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Business Roundtable Urges White House to Roll Back Financial Rules\par \par \uc2 By Gabriel T. Rubin\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A trade group representing large U.S. companies urged the White House to repeal or modify a slew of regulations, including several that affect financial services firms.\par \par \uc2 The letter from the Business Roundtable, which was sent a day in advance of a meeting between President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and manufacturing executives on Thursday, identifies four financial regulations the executives and their members would like to see rolled back. The letter was addressed to \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. president who now heads Mr. Trump's National Economic Council.\par \par \uc2 The Business Roundtable called on the Trump administration to overhaul the shareholder proposal process to pare down the ability of "activist investors with insignificant stakes in public companies" to "pursue social or political agendas" and to reconsider a Dodd-Frank Act requirement for firms to disclose CEO pay as a ratio of average employee pay.\par \par \uc2 Both of those rules are under the jurisdiction of the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , as is a rule to require public companies to disclose whether their products contain "conflict minerals" originating in certain central African countries. The Business Roundtable asks that that rule be reconsidered as well.\par \par \uc2 They also requested a "transitional period" in order to comply with new margin requirements for over-the-counter derivatives.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration has made deregulation a key part of its governing agenda, releasing an executive order shortly after Mr. Trump took office that called on federal agencies to eliminate two regulations for every new one created.\par \par \uc2 The Business Roundtable's requests followed the unveiling of Trump administration principles earlier in February on how to overhaul the financial regulatory system. Mr. Trump has directed the Treasury Department, under Secretary \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2 , to undertake a broad review of financial rules as part of the administration's efforts to spur economic growth.\par \par \uc2 U.K. Banks Unlikely to Keep Full EU Access, Bundesbank Official Says\par \par \uc2 By Paul Hannon\par \par \uc2 U.K.-based bank operations are unlikely to retain access to the \uc2 European Union\uc2 's single market after Brexit and a transition period to allow for a measured relocation process would be desirable, a senior Bundesbank official said Friday.\par \par \uc2 The U.K. voted in June 2016 to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2  and the government is expected to trigger a two-year period of exit talks next month. In January, U.K. Prime Minister \uc2 Theresa May\uc2  said the U.K. intended to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2 's single market and would instead seek a new free-trade agreement to allow the country to continue selling goods and services easily to \uc2 EU\uc2  member states.\par \par \uc2 However, \uc2 Andreas Dombret\uc2 , a member of the \uc2 German central bank\uc2 's executive board who is responsible for financial regulation, said that would make it unlikely that U.K.-based banks would retain a "passport" that would allow them to sell services in the \uc2 EU\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It seems that the prospects for \uc2 EU\uc2  market access through the U.K. look rather dim," said Mr. Dombret, speaking at the opening of a London office by Zeb, a German consultancy focused on financial services.\par \par \uc2 The U.K. could seek a status known as equivalence, under which the \uc2 EU\uc2  would recognize that its regulatory regime was the same as its own and its regulated institutions would therefore gain access to the bloc. However, Mr. Dombret said this status was likely to be too uncertain for banks making long-term location decisions. He added that there was no precedent for financial services being "fully integrated" in a free-trade agreement between the \uc2 EU\uc2  and another country.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombret warned that a transition period to allow banks a longer period in which to move some operations out of London might prove politically difficult, even if it made economic sense.\par \par \uc2 He said it was even possible that the two years of negotiations could end without an agreement, leaving the U.K. to exit from the bloc without any special deal\u8212\'20\'14an outcome that would be economically damaging to both the U.K. and the \uc2 EU\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "While economic policy will of course be an important topic during negotiations, we should not count on economic sanity being the main guiding principle," he said.\par \par \uc2 Bankers worry that such an outcome would interrupt access to complex financial instruments for businesses and investors around Europe, since the provision of those products is concentrated in London.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrets acknowledged that a sudden halt in the availability of products that allow businesses and investors to manage currency and other risks could threaten financial stability across the continent. But he said he was confident financial institutions would prepare for every possible outcome.\par \par \uc2 "We are working under the assumption that the financial sector will adapt to whatever outcome the negotiations will yield," he said. "It is not a pressing financial stability risk."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombret also warned against the U.K. easing regulation to retain banks, or other parts of Europe doing so to attract institutions that are on the move.\par \par \uc2 "We must avoid a regulatory race to the bottom at all costs," he said.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Renews Real-Estate Data Targeting Order\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Treasury Department\uc2  extended for another six months a data-collection program to aid a crackdown on money laundering in real estate.\par \par \uc2 The program, which began in March 2016 and was expanded in August, requires title insurance companies to identify the true owners of limited liability companies that buy luxury real estate in all-cash transactions in some large cities, including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami. It was set to end Thursday; the renewal expires Aug. 22.\par \par \uc2 Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which issued the directives, known as geographic targeting orders, said in a statement that the data collected thus far corroborate the agency's concerns about the use of shell companies to buy high-end property.\par \par \uc2 Acting FinCEN director Jamal El-Hindi said in the statement that the geographic-targeting orders are "producing valuable data" that's assisting law enforcement and are "serving to inform our future efforts to address money laundering in the real-estate sector."\par \par \uc2 Stephen Hudak, a FinCEN spokesman, declined to comment on any future plans to address the issue. Risk & Compliance Journal reported last year on the orders representing the first step toward broader anti-money laundering compliance requirements for the real-estate industry, which had previously fended off such efforts from the federal government after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 The goal, Treasury says, is to make it more difficult for buyers, particularly foreigners, to launder money through U.S. property purchases. About one-third of the transactions covered by the orders involve a person who is already the subject of a suspicious-activity report, FinCEN said.\par \par \uc2 Treasury says the orders impose the requirements on title-insurance companies because such insurance is a common feature in the vast majority of real-estate transactions, including those that don't involve banks, which would perform checks for money-laundering risks when considering whether to fund a mortgage. As such, Treasury says, the title insurance companies "can provide FinCEN with valuable information" about transactions of concern.\par \par \uc2 Michelle Korsmo, chief executive of the \uc2 American Land Title Association\uc2 , a trade group representing the companies covered by the orders, said the efforts of their member for the past year "appear to be beneficial" to the federal government's work identifying money-laundering schemes in real-estate purchases.\par \par \uc2 "We continue to work closely with our members and FinCEN to collect the needed information as efficiently as possible," said Ms. Korsmo.\par \par \uc2 FinCEN collects and analyzes suspicious-activity reports filed by financial institutions, and Mr. Hudak said banks have also been filing more reports related to potential money laundering involving real estate as a result of the attention generated by the geographic targeting orders.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hudak said the orders flagged, among others, beneficial owners suspected of being involved in public corruption in Asia and South America, and a beneficial owner who engaged in $160 million of suspicious financial activity and sought to disguise ownership of related financial accounts. He declined to provide further detail.\par \par \uc2 At some point, said Andrew Ittleman, a partner at Fuerst Ittleman David & Joseph PL, FinCEN will have to start the process of writing regulations to permanently formalize the process.\par \par \uc2 "Kicking the can down the road isn't the way this is supposed to be addressed. It's not the way federal agencies are supposed to create rules," he said.\par \par \uc2 Capital One\uc2  Discloses Probe Into Anti-Money Laundering Program\par \par \uc2 By AnnaMaria Andriotis\par \par \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp\uc2 . is under investigation for its anti-money-laundering program, according to the company's annual securities filing.\par \par \uc2 The bank disclosed Thursday that it is under investigation by the New York District Attorney's Office, the Justice Department and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department over "certain former check casher clients" of its commercial banking business and over its anti-money-laundering program.\par \par \uc2 The bank's November filing with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  said it had received subpoenas and requests for testimony, but not that it was being investigated.\par \par \uc2 A Capital One spokeswoman said the bank used different words in the filing to describe the same situation.\par \par \uc2 As previously disclosed, \uc2 Capital One\uc2  has also been the subject of an open consent order with the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  since July 2015 over regulatory deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering program.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 OCC\uc2  action has posed a hurdle for \uc2 Capital One\uc2 's planned acquisition of the \uc2 Cabela's Inc\uc2 . credit-card portfolio, raising the possibility another bank will snatch that deal away. That deal was announced last year when \uc2 Bass Pro Shops\uc2  agreed to purchase \uc2 Cabela's\uc2 . \uc2 Capital One\uc2  agreed to buy the credit-card business as part of the deal.\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Capital One\uc2 's earnings call last month, Chief Executive \uc2 Richard Fairbank\uc2  said the bank didn't expect to receive regulatory approval for the purchase before Oct. 3. That is when \uc2 Cabela's\uc2  and Bass Pros Shops can walk away from the transaction. He added that the bank wouldn't be able to refile its application for the deal until after "we have completed our work under the AML consent order."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Brazil's Credit Market Likely to Recover in 2H\par \par \uc2 The amount of credit in Brazil's financial system, which started this year declining, is expected to recover some ground in 2H, says the economist team at Banco de Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Brasil. "Banks will continue adopting a cautious approach on lending (mainly in the first half) due to the risk of higher delinquency rates by individuals and by companies. But, there is scope for some acceleration of credit supply from the second half of this year on, following higher economic growth rate," it says. Credit totaled BRL3.07T ($1T) in January, down 3.9% from the same month in 2016. (rogerio.jelmayer@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Regulators Grant Reprieve on New Margin Requirements\par \par \uc2 US and European regulators grant a six month grace period to smaller financial firms that don't yet have paperwork ready to meet new margin requirements set to kick-in on March 1 for certain swaps transactions. Banks have complained that some of their smaller clients -- including pension funds and insurance firms -- aren't yet ready to begin posting so-called variation margin. US bank regulators and European policy makers agreed to the grace period a week after the CFTC adopted a similar move. "The final rule incorporated a phase-in period for swap entities to begin exchanging variation margin with their swap counterparties," the US banking regulators said in a statement. "The phase-in period gave markets and firms time to adjust to the new requirements, which were adopted in October 2015." (andrew.ackerman@wsj.com; @amacker)\par \par \uc2 Bank Execs Await Loan-Loss Rule\par \par \uc2 Executives at US banks say they're getting ready for a new accounting rule that will revamp how they treat loan losses, but they expect it to cause increases in their loan impairments that will cut into their regulatory capital, a Deloitte & Touche survey says. The rule, which banks will start adopting as soon as 2019, will require them to book losses on soured loans much faster, and is expected to require some banks to set aside more in reserves for loan losses. Seventy percent of the 31 banks responding to the Deloitte survey say they've started preparations for the new approach, and majorities say they expect their impairments of mortgages, consumer loans and commercial loans to rise by at least 10%. As a result, majorities of those surveyed anticipate declines in their regulatory-capital ratios, and more than 80% expect their earnings to become more volatile under the new model.

Banks have been hiding such products off their balance sheets, leaving room on their books to make more loans. NSBO Research notes wealth-management products generally banned by banking regulators from investing in commercial property. The products, though, have been able to do so "by investing in asset-management products sold by brokers or fund companies' subsidiaries--which are not prohibited from these kind of investments" by securities regulators. But the new framework, led by \uc2 China's central bank\uc2  and yet to be approved by top leaders, would ban asset-management products from investing in other ones. How effective implementation would be is key. (chao.deng@wsj.com; @chao_deng)\par \par \uc2 China's Coordinated Move on Asset Managers\par \par \uc2 Chinese financial regulators have come up with a draft framework on overseeing the country's near-$9 trillion asset-management industry. Among the new requirements, firms would have put aside reserves equal to 10% of product-management fees and be barred from promising guaranteed returns. Gavekal Research describes the work a "rare coordinated move by the \uc2 People's Bank of China\uc2 --together with the banking, securities and insurance regulators"--which "signals a more-joined-up approach to financial supervision" in China's efforts "to curb the rapid expansion of" shadow finance there. At the end of 2016, banks' exposure to off-balance-sheet wealth-management products totaled CNY26 trillion, 30% higher than a year earlier. "Under the draft rules, financial institutions--which have previously found ways to arbitrage China's fragmented regulatory environment--will be subject to coordinated supervision and tighter restrictions," says Gavekal.

As relations between the new administration and China take hold, however, there are several areas that Mr. Trump has yet to recognize publicly as sore points for the U.S. One of them: Wall Street firms' limited access to China's financial sector.\par \par \uc2 China joined the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  in 2001. After a five-year grace period, the country was supposed to open its doors wider to foreign banks. While that happened on paper, in reality rules have made it difficult for foreign banks to penetrate the market. The share of foreign banking operations amounted to just 1.4% of China's total banking assets in 2015, according the \uc2 China Banking Regulatory Commission\uc2 . It was 2.4% in 2007.\par \par \uc2 In practice, foreign banks must create separate companies to operate in China and face difficulties opening branches.\par \par \uc2 "As a result, foreign banks have almost no retail banking business, and they can't utilize their more efficient banking services to compete head to head against China's own banks," said \uc2 Scott Kennedy\uc2  of the \uc2 Center for Strategic and International Studies\uc2 , a Washington think tank. "There are similar constraints still in place for the securities business, credit ratings, insurance and credit cards."\par \par \uc2 Discussions about a bilateral investment treaty started in 2008 and have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-vows-to-cut-red-tape-to-boost-foreign-investment-1475993079"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dragged on}}}\uc2  without a deal. It isn't clear whether such talks will continue under Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, repeated assurances by Chinese regulators to allow the world greater access to the country's finance industry are getting stale.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 National Development and Reform Commission{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-ease-curbs-on-foreign-investment-in-finance-1483094113"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 made such a promise}}}\uc2  in December. Then, the State Council said it would ease investment curbs, including in banking, securities, futures, fund management and insurance. Its statement was published Jan. 17, the same day President \uc2 Xi Jinping{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinping-in-davos-making-the-most-of-a-waning-era-1484560806"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 took to the stage}}}\uc2  at the \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  in Davos, Switzerland. Critics quickly pointed out the irony of an economic nationalist declaring China's openness to the world.\par \par \uc2 Beijing has kept its finance sector well protected because banks are its major conduit for implementing economic policy. By and large, funds flow to China's corporate sector through state-owned banks, not the securities market.\par \par \uc2 A foreign commercial bank can own up to 25% of a domestic commercial bank, while a foreign investment bank can own up to 49% of a securities joint venture. For example, \uc2 HSBC Holdings PLC\uc2  has a 19.9% stake in Bank of Communications Co., while \uc2 UBS Group AG\uc2  and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  have been {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-and-ubs-to-increase-stakes-in-mainland-china-joint-ventures-1483883686"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 looking to increase stakes}}}\uc2  in their securities joint ventures to 49%, from about 25% and about 33%, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Other areas of finance are up for review. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-underwhelms-with-market-opening-plan-1481196590"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A December draft}}}\uc2  of revised rules for opening up markets loosened restrictions on the credit-rating industry.\par \par \uc2 Currently, foreign firms can rate domestic securities only through joint ventures\u8212\'20\'14something the likes of \uc2 Moody's Investors Service\uc2 , \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  and S&P Global Ratings have been reluctant to do.\par \par \uc2 Most China observers aren't hopeful about meaningful change to the finance sector, given that Mr. Trump has focused his complaints toward China on its trade and currency practices.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see China taking a pre-emptive action to further open up its banking market to foreign banks at this stage, given already heightened trade tensions, particularly with the U.S." said Matthew Phillips, a Hong Kong-based financial-services partner at PwC. "Trade is going to drive the dynamic between the two countries and until China sees the lay of the land, it might not want to show its hand and further open access to a critical area."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/Opening-Chinas-Financial-Markets/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro Interactive: Opening China's Financial Markets}}}\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Trump Team Broadens Search for Fed Regulatory Post\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-team-broadens-search-for-fed-regulatory-post-1487887637?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Trump administration has broadened}}}\uc2  its search for a key regulatory job at the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , according to people familiar with the matter, meeting in recent weeks with at least two people about the post of Fed vice chair in charge of bank oversight.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  hasn't announced who he will nominate to the currently vacant post, and his decision won't be final until that happens. He also has at least two other seats on the Fed's seven-member board to fill. One of those is currently vacant, and the other will be open once Fed governor \uc2 Daniel Tarullo\uc2 , currently the de facto chief of bank oversight, resigns in early April.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-warn-fed-against-adopting-new-rules-before-senate-confirms-trump-nominee-1487908416"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Republicans Warn Fed Against Adopting New Rules Before Senate Confirms Trump Nominee}}}\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Interactive: Opening China's Financial Markets\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/Opening-Chinas-Financial-Markets/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 As China struggles to liberalize}}}\uc2  its economy while averting a destabilizing slowdown, the financial sector poses significant challenges.

"We're all for banks being highly regulated but we want to make sure that banks are lending. That is the No. 1 priority for us."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Regulators Issue Guidance Aimed at Robo Investment Advisers\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-issue-guidance-aimed-at-robo-investment-advisers-1487887759"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. market regulators on Thursday}}}\uc2  issued their first set of guidelines aimed at robo advisers, a burgeoning class of money managers that have sometimes come under fire for whether they're sufficiently clear about how their platforms work.\par \par \uc2 Robo advisers such as \uc2 Betterment LLC\uc2  and Wealthfront Inc. use algorithms to analyze a client's demographic profile and investment goals in order to build a portfolio for them. Humans aren't involved in picking assets and, as a result, the firms can undercut other brokers and money managers by selling their services at a lower cost.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Business Roundtable Urges White House to Roll Back Financial Rules\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/business-roundtable-urges-white-house-to-roll-back-financial-rules-1487884529?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A trade group representing large}}}\uc2  U.S. companies urged the White House to repeal or modify a slew of regulations, including several that affect financial services firms.\par \par \uc2 The letter from the Business Roundtable, which was sent a day in advance of a meeting between President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  and manufacturing executives on Thursday, identifies four financial regulations the executives and their members would like to see rolled back.

In January, U.K. Prime Minister \uc2 Theresa May\uc2  said the U.K. intended to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2 's single market and would instead seek a new free-trade agreement to allow the country to continue selling goods and services easily to \uc2 EU\uc2  member states.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Renews Real-Estate Data Targeting Order\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2017/02/23/u-s-renews-real-estate-data-targeting-order/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The U.S. Treasury Department}}}\uc2  extended for another six months a data-collection program to aid a crackdown on money laundering in real estate.\par \par \uc2 The program, which began in March 2016 and was expanded in August, requires title insurance companies to identify the true owners of limited liability companies that buy luxury real estate in all-cash transactions in some large cities, including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami.

In keeping with the eurozone's love of acronyms, the new framework will be known as STAMP\u8364\'20\'AC, short for Stress Test \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  for Macroprudential Purposes in the euro area. The framework sets out five requirements for successful stress tests. "The tools go well beyond the requirements of the traditional solvency stress tests applied to banks, and include a broader set of institutions than just banks, an analysis of the financial cycle, as well as an assessment of systemic risk levels associated with the economic and financial shocks considered in adverse scenarios," Mr. Const\u226\'00\'E2ncio writes.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170223ed2n008et\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

He added that there was not "one model which is right or wrong" and that people had "unrealistic expectations of what we're going to get from economics in the next five years".\par \par \uc2 Mr Vlieghe said that not all of the difference between forecasts and what happens were "mistakes". If people were expecting the economy to always conform to the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 's central predictions, they were setting themselves up for "persistent disappointment", he said.\par \par \uc2 Economic forecasting was under the microscope at the committee meeting after the bank revised up its forecast for economic growth over the next three years. At the start of the year, chief economist \uc2 Andy Haldane\uc2  called the bank's failure to forecast the 2008 financial crisis a "Michael Fish moment" after the weather forecaster's infamous 1987 dismissal of a hurricane in England that duly arrived.\par \par \uc2 Mark Carney\uc2 , BoE governor, and other members of the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee were giving evidence to the committee on the bank's February inflation report , which revised up forecast growth in 2017 from 1.4 to 2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The bank has not changed its long-term view on Brexit, Mr Haldane said yesterday but had "learnt" new information about the world including that consumer spending was resilient and global growth was stronger than thought.\par \par \uc2 Roughly half of the revision was due to government spending announced at the Autumn Statement in November, Mr Haldane said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Carney told the committee that there were a range of paths for the economy over the next few years. He said that they had a forecast but there were also " scenarios around the forecast" including one "where the economy proceeds smoothly to a broad and ambitious [post-Brexit] trade deal". In that scenario, there would be faster growth but also higher interest rates.\par \par \uc2 Another scenario would be "less optimistic" and involve a worse trade deal, lower economic growth and low rates for longer, he said.\par \par \uc2 Several MPs on the committee questioned whether the bank was "trapped in a pre-2008 mindset" and whether it took into account structural changes to the economy over the past decade including more immigration, lower rates of home ownership and big changes in the labour market.\par \par \uc2 Mr Carney said the bank was not "in any way, shape or form caught in a pre-2008 [mindset]". But he agreed that the economy had changed with new types of employment affecting wages, alongside technological changes such as \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "There has been a big structural shift in terms of the proportion of home ownership," he said, as well as a change in what he called "millennial attitudes towards home ownership and rent ". But he said the bank had incorporated this in its modelling through large-scale surveys, as well as face-to-face interviews.\par \par \uc2 "Do we think we have a perfect model of the British household? No," he said.\par \par \uc2 On migration, the governor said, it was "something about which we will have to pay particular attention in the coming years" as Britain's exit from the \uc2 EU\uc2  changed migration flows.\par \par \uc2 He also noted that migrants increased both economic demand and the labour supply.\par \par \uc2 Shout or talk page 11\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170222ed2m0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 This guest post on intelligent automation is from \uc2 Axel Lehmann\uc2 , group chief operating officer at UBS.\par \par \uc2 ______________\par \par \uc2 Banking is technology. Technology is humans \u8230\'20\'26 a well-known industry mantra. So, will banking clients soon be served by androids in pinstripes? Or will whole banking operations succumb to thinking machines as our new masters? We think not.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , intelligent automation and robotics are nonetheless key elements of the technological revolution being driven by the financial industry. Banking has never been afraid of adapting and using new technologies. After all, we pioneered the automatic cash dispenser (ATM) over 40 years ago. In the 70\u8217\'20\'19s, electronic stock trading began on exchange trading floors. Banks are yet again among the leading advocates and consumers of new emerging technologies. This is also reflected in numbers. Financial services have the second largest technology spend behind the technology sector itself.\par \par \uc2 Looking into the near future we predict cognitively intelligent machines will make banking services even more accessible and nimble. A bank like ours is particularly interested in exploiting rapid advances in audio and visual recognition technology as well as a secure and convenient method of customer authentication. For example, an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  enabled personal financial manager (PFM) can alert customers to potential cash-flow problems, and identify where you can save money. \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  can also be used to make banking more interactive. One start-up has already designed a voice-recognition add-on for mobile banking apps.\par \par \uc2 Just as importantly, these new technologies offer banks the ability to reduce complexity and manage rising costs in the face of regulatory and market pressure. Intelligent machines and applications bring even greater effectiveness and efficiency in automating routine processes. We already use automated systems to check and validate client documentation when we on-board new customers, or to ensure existing customers comply with new regulations. As machines become more \u8220\'20\'1Cintelligent\u8221\'20\'1D, they will be able to undertake more complex tasks, like credit scoring or automated report writing. For example, we are already using a leading cognitive computing solution to handle IT incidents more efficiently.\par \par \uc2 Automation and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will not only have a great impact on the operating environment and how we interact with clients, but also on how bank employees will do their jobs. \u8220\'20\'1CThinking\u8221\'20\'1D machines have the potential to become our trusted and dependable assistants, enhancing human capabilities and allow us to free people from routine work, empowering them to concentrate on more creative, value-added services. This is an important point especially in view of the fears about intelligent machines substituting humans and taking our jobs. As with any new technology, we will all need to adapt to an increasingly automated workplace. We must be willing to learn in order to understand and make the best use of the computing and self-learning power of intelligent machines.\par \par \uc2 The path for intelligent automation will not be straightforward. To succeed in an inherently data-driven world, automation and robotics will have to be robust, compliant and well governed. Financial services organizations, policymakers and regulators will need to work together on prudent rules and issues of liability without stifling innovation.\par \par \uc2 Banks should also not underestimate issues around the acceptance of \u8220\'20\'1Cintelligent\u8221\'20\'1D machines by their workforce and clients. In future, managers will need to have the skills to lead a workforce enhanced by \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . There is no doubt that streamlining and reconfiguration of the operating environment and digitalization, driven by \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , intelligent automation and robotics, needs to be pursued in tandem in this evolving landscape.\par \par \uc2 If we get it right, intelligent automation will help us provide clients with more compelling and insightful services. It will relieve people of mundane and repetitive tasks and free them to do more creative and fulfilling work. It will also make banking operations more efficient and responsive. We all stand to gain.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 UBS\uc2  white paper, Intelligent Automation, is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/longroom/content/71038"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 available in the usual place.  }}}\uc2  white paper, Intelligent Automation, is \par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170221ed2l006bt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc30}{\*\bkmkend toc30}\b \uc2 Snap Focuses on Its Spectacles --- As IPO approaches, firm tries to bolster video-making glasses by selling them online\b0\par\par\uc2 By Georgia Wells   \par \uc2 912 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 February 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)\par \uc2 WSJE\par B1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Sarah Peretz is seemingly the ideal customer for Snapchat's video-recording sunglasses called Spectacles.\par \par \uc2 The 20-year-old is a "Snapchat influencer," meaning she earns money from promoting brands in her short videos about cooking and beauty. She raced to Venice Beach, Calif., in November to become one of the first people to buy Spectacles, from a vending machine on the boardwalk.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Peretz says she hasn't used the sunglasses for weeks. "Spectacles have become stale," the Los Angeles resident said. "At first it was the statement piece of your outfit. Now it's not."\par \par \uc2 As the company behind the messaging app Snapchat begins marketing its initial public offering of stock this week, it will need to ensure its other product doesn't become an afterthought.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 . expanded sales of Spectacles by making the sunglasses available to anyone in the U.S. through an online store at Spectacles.com.\par \par \uc2 The launch coincides with the closure of Snap's New York City pop-up store, where as of early February there were often more employees than shoppers.\par \par \uc2 Behind the scenes, Snap's founders were expected to begin marketing the IPO to mutual funds and hedge funds, starting Monday in London.\par \par \uc2 Snap released Spectacles in November days before it filed for an IPO, signaling the company's ambition beyond social networking. The $130 one-size-fits-all glasses are outfitted with a camera that, with a tap of a button near the hinge, can record as much as 30 seconds of video and then upload it to Snapchat.\par \par \uc2 The company created buzz by selling Spectacles exclusively through vending machines in hard-to-reach locales such as the Grand Canyon, and in major cities such as Seattle earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 Some Spectacles owners praise the glasses. Mark Mansour, a recruitment manager at a telecom company in Sydney, says he wore his Spectacles to record walking from a train station to his office, and plans to share the video with job applicants who might have trouble finding the building where he works. "I love the novelty of Spectacles," Mr. Mansour said.\par \par \uc2 But three months after the launch, some early adopters say the novelty has worn off. The average price for the gadget on \uc2 eBay\uc2  has dropped to about $180, from more than $900 in early November, according to e-commerce \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 Terapeak Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Justin Wu, a marketing consultant who posts about entrepreneurship on Snapchat, no longer records content on the Spectacles he bought the first day Snap started selling them. He says he grew tired of what he described as the "cumbersome" process waiting for the video to publish on Snapchat.\par \par \uc2 Now he uses his Spectacles as sunglasses.\par \par \uc2 Kyle Hanner, a competitive eater and social-media manager for a restaurant delivery company in St. Louis, says that Spectacles drains his phone battery when he uploads content. So he only posts video about once a week now, compared with four times a week when he got the glasses in November.\par \par \uc2 He plans to wear his Spectacles when he competes in a hot-wings eating contest on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Others say the recorded video from Spectacles shakes too much. Ms. Peretz says she used the glasses to film cooking a steak, but viewers complained the video gave them headaches. She and her boyfriend, Taylor Nikolai, also a Snapchat influencer, haven't used their Spectacles since Christmas as a result.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Snap says the company continues to make incremental improvements to Spectacles. She says Snap recently made the videos that people share from Spectacles crisper.\par \par \uc2 Snap has tempered expectations of its first hardware product. Co-founder and Chief Executive Evan Spiegel called Spectacles a "toy" in a September interview with WSJ. Magazine, saying the company would roll them out slowly. Snap in December hired Ralph Diaz, the global director of retail operations at sunglasses company \uc2 Oakley Inc\uc2 ., and installed him in a similar role.\par \par \uc2 A move into hardware is a gamble for any internet company, let alone one that has only been around for five years. Managing inventory is a challenge, as is appealing to fickle consumer tastes.\par \par \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  pulled the plug on smartphone manufacturing in 2014 just 22 months after a costly acquisition of \uc2 Motorola Inc\uc2 ., and it stopped selling \uc2 Google\uc2  Glass video-recording glasses after they drew ridicule. \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . has had success with Kindle tablets and Echo speakers, but it failed with a smartphone. \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . struggled with last year's launch of its Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset.\par \par \uc2 In Snap's nearly 200-page public-offering document, the company mentions Spectacles 45 times and 18 of those references are in the section describing the company's risks. Snap warned that Spectacles could malfunction, and it could experience problems with the manufacturing or components inside Spectacles.\par \par \uc2 Snap released videos Friday to market its public offering to investors. The presentation includes a 35-minute general overview of Snap and an eight-minute product overview of Snapchat, but not one for Spectacles.\par \par \uc2 Snap's chief strategist, \uc2 Imran Khan\uc2 , says in the overview video that it takes a long time to create great products and meaningful innovation doesn't come on a schedule. "The reaction from our community is also very difficult to predict," Mr. Khan said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20170221000051"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170221ed2l0001c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The arrest of the man leading South Korea's largest conglomerate pushes the company to the precipice. Management will need to be restructured immediately because \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's role in the South Korean economy is colossal.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Son Young-ho, 44, vividly remembers when he first joined \uc2 Samsung Card\uc2  two decades ago. "I was so proud to be starting my career at \uc2 Samsung\uc2 , with its office in the centre of downtown Seoul. I felt like my future was guaranteed."\par \par \uc2 Like Son, hundreds of thousands of college students every year dream of donning the official pin bearing \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's iconic blue logo, but only a few are able to join the top company in South Korea. Those who do make the cut are viewed as prime catches by matchmaking agencies, on the same level as doctors and lawyers.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2  is so large that its total assets account for one-fifth of South Korea's gross domestic product and the group accounts for more than 30 per cent of total market capitalisation in the country. People often speak of "the Republic of \uc2 Samsung\uc2 ", a reference to the influence the company wields in Asia's fourth-largest economy.\par \par \uc2 All this does not mean, however, that \uc2 Samsung\uc2  always has the respect of the people. Repeated tax-dodging scandals and suspicions of bribery have made the company a regular target of anti-corporate sentiment. For more than a year, former employees and their family members have been staging sit-in rallies in front of \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's office in Gangnam demanding an apology and compensation for workers at its semiconductor factory who have been diagnosed with leukemia.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the final straw came on Friday morning when the Seoul Central District Court approved the arrest warrant for Lee, which special prosecutors had sought. The 48-year-old heir is suspected of paying 43bn won ($37.3m) to two foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil, a longtime friend of President Park Geun-hye, in return for political favours.\par \par \uc2 In January, the court denied prosecutors' initial request for an arrest warrant due to lack of evidence. But investigation into Lee and his connections with President Park continued, and on February 3, prosecutors raided the country's financial regulator and anti-trust agency, seizing documents related to Lee.\par \par \uc2 Investigators have reportedly collected testimonies that Ms Park, in return for \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's bribes, pressured the \uc2 National Pension Service\uc2  to vote in favour of a merger of\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://asia.nikkei.com/Company/0FS1T0-E"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Samsung C&T }}}\uc2  and Cheil Industries in 2015, a controversial move that strengthened Lee's control of the group immensely.\par \par \uc2 The merger raised Lee's stake in C&T to 16.5 per cent, thanks to his 23.2 per cent stake in Cheil. C&T is a key company in the group's ownership structure, as it holds 4.2 per cent in \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 , the crown jewel of the conglomerate.\par \par \uc2 Kim Sang-bong, a philosophy professor at Chonnam National University in Gwangju, compared \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's Lee family to North Korea's ruling Kim family.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Samsung\uc2  is above the law and the country. It is similar to North Korea, where the 'great leader' is above the Workers' Party," said Mr Kim, who urged a boycott of \uc2 Samsung\uc2  products in 2010. "\uc2 Samsung\uc2 's Lee family has uncontrolled power, which does not make sense in a democratic society. The political power is serving the interests of Lee Jae-yong's family."\par \par \uc2 Since his release from detention on January 19, Mr Lee has been taking actions to fulfil the promises he made during a parliamentary hearing in which he was questioned over the scandal. One of the most symbolic moves came on February 6, when \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2  withdrew its membership from the \uc2 Federation of Korean Industries\uc2 , the lobby group for major companies. FKI played a key role in funnelling funds from large corporations to two foundations controlled by Mr Choi, the president's confidante.\par \par \uc2 Another change is internal. \uc2 Samsung\uc2  plans to close its Future Strategy Office, an organisation said to be directly involved in the corruption scandal. Local media have reported that Lee may soon donate his private wealth to society, with the amount reported to be at least $1bn, though \uc2 Samsung\uc2  denies this.\par \par \uc2 These moves, however, did not guarantee Mr Lee's escape from further investigation, and another arrest warrant eventually came on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Shareholders are also pressuring \uc2 Samsung\uc2  to get to the bottom of the scandal. In December, Netherlands-based APG Asset Management sent a letter to \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2  seeking an explanation of allegations that the company had made contributions to foundations linked to Mr Choi. APG is believed to hold a 0.8 per cent stake in the electronics titan.\par \par \uc2 US activist hedge fund \uc2 Elliott Management\uc2 , which holds a roughly 0.62 per cent stake in the company, has been asking it to pay more dividends and to diversify its boardroom. Elliott opposed the merger of C&T and Cheil, arguing that it was designed to benefit Cheil shareholders at the expense of those of C&T.\par \par \uc2 Politicians are also urging the company to embrace more transparent corporate governance, accusing the Lee family - which controls the whole conglomerate despite holding a proportionately tiny stake in its companies - of not taking responsibility for any of \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's setbacks and failures.\par \par \uc2 Moon Jae-in, of the opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, is seen as the likely frontrunner in the country's upcoming presidential election. He has vowed to bring \uc2 Samsung\uc2  to heel if he wins, saying the company should apologize for its misdeeds.\par \par \uc2 The lawyer-turned-politician has also raised the problem of corporate governance at \uc2 Samsung\uc2 , criticizing the circular shareholding scheme that gives the Lee family such disproportionate control. The family holds a 39.1 per cent stake in \uc2 Samsung C&T\uc2 , which in turn owns a 19.3 per cent stake in\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://asia.nikkei.com/Company/05QVSJ-E"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Samsung Life Insurance }}}\uc2  and a 4.2 per cent stake in \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 . \uc2 Samsung Life\uc2  controls the group's financial affiliates, while other subsidiaries are under the umbrella of \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For market watchers, a big question is who will replace Mr Lee, \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's heir apparent, as he is no longer in the picture.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 ' three key executives - Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun, President Yoon Boo-keun and President Shin Jong-kyun - are strong candidates for the job. All of them are on the company's board of directors.\par \par \uc2 "Even if Lee Jae-yong is arrested, the company could be operated by the three executives who have led the company with no problems," said Park Ju-gun, president of CEO Score, a corporate information provider, before Friday's arrest.\par \par \uc2 Mr Kwon, 64, has headed the company's device solutions business, which includes semiconductors, since 2011, while Mr Yoon, also 64, has been in charge of the consumer electronics division for the last five years. Mr Shin, 61, took the helm of the IT and mobile communications division in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Mr Kwon has worked for the company more than three decades, having obtained a PhD in electrical engineering from \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 . Mr Yoon based his career on improving TVs and other consumer electronics over the nearly 40 years he has been with the company. He studied telecommunications engineering at Hanyang University in Seoul.\par \par \uc2 Mr Shin, an expert in mobile telecommunications, was a driving force behind the company's success in the smartphone business for the last few years, though his reputation was tainted by last year's Galaxy Note 7 debacle.\par \par \uc2 "But because they are professional executives, they may not push for investing large amount of money in mergers and acquisitions, like the company did with Harman," said Mr Park of CEO Score.\par \par \uc2 In November, \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2  agreed to acquire Harman International Industries of the US for $8bn. The largest M&A deal in South Korean history made clear \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's ambition to become the world's top player in the market for connected car solutions.\par \par \uc2 There is another key person whose absence could affect the company: Chairman Lee Kun-hee, who transformed \uc2 Samsung\uc2  into a global player in electronics. The 75-year-old has been hospitalized for almost three years since suffering a heart attack in May 2014.\par \par \uc2 Even though his son took over most roles, analysts say his death would likely raise inheritance tax issues for Lee Jae-yong and his siblings. The chairman's stocks, including his 3.58 per cent stake in \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 , are worth more than 15tn won. The country levies a 50 per cent tax on inheritance exceeding 3bn won, a potentially serious hurdle for the younger Lee and his plans of succession.\par \par \uc2 Some also suggest that the elder Lee's death would lead to a power struggle between the executives he had appointed and his son. "Lee Jae-yong may dismiss executives appointed by Lee Kun-hee to consolidate his power within the group," said Kim Sang-jo, an economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul who has led minority shareholders' activities against South Korean\u160\'00\'A0chaebol conglomerates for 20 years.\par \par \uc2 The death of Lee Kun-hee will also mark the end of \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's second generation of leadership. Under his watch, the company grew sharply, but many workers' rights were sacrificed.\par \par \uc2 Many feel the time is ripe for \uc2 Samsung\uc2  and other chaebol to reform their corporate governance practices. Mr Kim of Hansung University said parliament should revise the Commercial Act and introduce measures to strengthen shareholder rights, such as allowing them to vote online during shareholders meetings. He also said the \uc2 National Pension Service\uc2  should exercise its voting rights more aggressively to prevent chaebol from putting profits before the interests of shareholders.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2  is already making some moves to better protect shareholders. Responding to criticism that all nine of its board members are Korean, the company announced in November that it will add at least one independent board director with international corporate experience. \uc2 Samsung\uc2  also said it is reviewing the pros and cons of a holding company structure, a process that could take at least six months.\par \par \uc2 Despite the scandal, \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 ' earnings have remained upbeat thanks to its flourishing semiconductor business. \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's operating profit surged 50.2 per cent on the year to 9.22tn won in the fourth quarter of 2016. This marked a rapid recovery from poor third-quarter results stemming from the discontinuation of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in October. Fourth-quarter sales, however, at 53.3tn won, were virtually flat compared with the previous year.\par \par \uc2 Full-year sales for 2016 reached 201.9tn won, up 1 per cent from a year before, while net profit attributable to shareholders jumped 19.9 per cent to 22.4tn won. The company announced dividend payments of 27,500 won per share in 2016, with total payments coming to 3.85tn won, up 24.2 per cent from a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say \uc2 Samsung\uc2  may continue to enjoy remarkable earnings this year thanks to strong demand for memory chips. "From the second quarter, the company is expected to post 10tn won of quarterly operating profit, driven by strong price trend of memory chips," said Choi Do-yeon, an analyst at Kyobo Securities.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 ' stock price has been losing steam since January 26, when it hit a record high of 2m won. It has dropped over 5 per cent since then and closed the week on Friday at 1,893,000 won, while the larger KOSPI index remained virtually flat during the same period.\par \par \uc2 Another challenge for the company is the smartphone market. \uc2 Samsung\uc2  dropped to second place worldwide behind Apple in the fourth quarter of last year, with shipments declining 5.2 per cent to 77.5m units from a year ago, according to IDC. Apple shipped a record 78.3m units during the same period thanks to the success of its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.\par \par \uc2 With the bribery investigation still hanging over the \uc2 Samsung\uc2  empire, analysts say the issuance of an arrest warrant for Mr Lee was a critical moment for the group.\par \par \uc2 "The arrest has no immediate impact on the credit rating of \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 ," said Shelley Jang, director of Asia-Pacific Corporates at \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  on Friday. She points to the company's solid fundamentals and the strength of its businesses, along with its "market dominance and technology leadership."\par \par \uc2 However, she adds that the arrest "could negatively impact investors' sentiment in the short term." Even though a team of professional managers could run its daily operations, "its long-term strategic investment decisions like major M&A or overseas expansion plans could be delayed."\par \par \uc2 As the acquisition of Harman shows, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  is keen to secure new growth engines. In addition to smart cars, it is also looking into such areas as biopharmaceuticals and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology. Such moves require strong leadership and bold decision-making, making Lee Jae-yong's arrest all the more devastating for the company.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://asia.nikkei.com/Features/Samsung-on-the-spot/Samsung-leader-s-arrest-imperils-company-and-country"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A version of this article }}}\uc2  was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on February 17.\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://asia.nikkei.com/?n_cid=NARAN212&utm_source=FTwebsite&utm_medium=bottom&utm_content=textlink&utm_campaign=FTwebpromo"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Website\u160\'00\'A0 }}}\uc2  |\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://regist.asia.nikkei.com/member/register/?n_cid=NARAN213&utm_source=FTwebsite&utm_medium=bottom&utm_content=textlink&utm_campaign=FTwebpromo_subs"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Subscribe }}}\uc2 . \u169\'00\'A92016 \uc2 Nikkei Inc\uc2 .

Lane; \uc2 ECB\uc2 's Governing Council member defends the central bank's forward guidance\b0\par\par\uc2 By Todd Buell and Hans Bentzien \par \uc2 2,637 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 February 2017\par 13:34\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Ireland's central bank Gov. Philip R. Lane sat down with Todd Buell and Hans Bentzien of The Wall Street Journal for an interview on Feb. 16th at the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 's headquarters in Frankfurt. Mr. Lane defended the \uc2 ECB\uc2 's forward guidance and said that the quantitative easing program was "open ended" and a taper decision should be based on data, not a date on the calendar. He also discussed financial regulatory topics and the impact of Brexit on Ireland.\par \par \uc2 Below are edited excerpts of Mr. Lane's interview with the Journal.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: The eurozone economy is doing well currently. Why do we need such accommodative monetary policy?\par \par \uc2 So all of that is built on the accommodative monetary policy. Now of course, the euro area is behind the U.S. in the timing of the recovery. So it isn't too surprising we're growing more quickly because the amount of slack in Europe is bigger.\par \par \uc2 I mean, monetary policy is\u8212\'20\'14you know, it'd be hard to say it's always kind of the dominant factor, but it's a supporting factor in this recovery.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: OK, but still we must be reaching a point, right, where QE is probably near the limits, right? What's the right time to start talking about tapering?\par \par \uc2 When the sovereign bond purchase program was decided in early 2015, the total volume of purchases of all programs was set at 60 billion [euros] a month. Then last March, the assessment was there were quite a few negative indicators in the world economy. And in that context, the decision was made to go from 60 to 80. Now we've decided to go back from 80 to 60.\par \par \uc2 So it's a normalization of this quantity of purchases. It's quite distinct from the debate that, obviously, at some point will occur, which is that move to tapering.\par \par \uc2 But the important point is all of the indicators you see are based on, I think, market expectations of this program, you know, being in place. So you can't think too hard about the counterfactuals where we abandon the program. So it's important that the program is, you know, maintained. Currently it's an open-ended program. It's 60 billion a month. There's no declaration of what happens after that.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Would you agree that monetary policy becomes more and more accommodative because inflation is rising?\par \par \uc2 I think the consensus is headline inflation is currently rising because of base effects but that there's not much movement in the core. We know it's predictable that headline inflation is going to come down. So as the base effect washes out, you know, the inflation rate\u8212\'20\'14headline inflation rate is going to fall again.\par \par \uc2 So what we have to assess is, you know, when you look past those base effects, what's the direction for medium-term inflation prospects? And the assessment is we don't see a signal yet that that's going back to the target. So there's not a reason at the moment to turn off the accommodation.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: But the March [inflation] forecasts are coming out, and the previous one for 2017, I recall, was 1.3 [percent]. Do you think that the forecast now for this year is going to be higher?\par \par \uc2 For headline? I don't have a strong view about what might happen to headline inflation, which isn't directly relevant for how we set policy. But I am confident that the monetary mechanism remains effective, that the \uc2 ECB\uc2  monetary policy will succeed in returning inflation to target.\par \par \uc2 What we're seeing is a steady recovery in euro area GDP, a steady recovery in employment; and essentially, as the level of activity goes up, that, you know, standard Phillips curve type mechanisms are kicking in and will kick in. But this is gradual.\par \par \uc2 It's good to see positive reports. It's satisfying to see that the euro area economy is growing at a steady pace, but it isn't going at a speed where you think there's suddenly going to be a surge of inflation.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: OK. But just to press the point once more, some have said that summer would be the appropriate time to start talking about tapering, you know, the third quarter. Is that on your calendar?\par \par \uc2 I think there's a classic split between time-dependence versus data-dependence. I think the time to think about it is when you do have new forecasts that indicate we are materially closer to achieving sustainable-inflation at target. And you know, at the last press conference, \uc2 Mario Draghi\uc2 , you know, gave the various criteria by which he would think about that.\par \par \uc2 So it's\u8212\'20\'14when that time arrives\u8212\'20\'14is the time to talk about it rather than saying the particular calendar point at which you would start to talk about it.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: OK. Now, on the question of interest rates, there are some people who have suggested that the \uc2 ECB\uc2  maybe should get rid of this commitment to have rates at current or lower levels. What's your position on that?\par \par \uc2 So I think there's a trade-off there. On the one hand, you know, signaling to everyone that the \uc2 ECB\uc2  stands ready to act both through lowering rates and indicating we are ready to increase the volume of purchases is a signal that the \uc2 ECB\uc2  is flexible and reactive to possible negative market developments. So that is, I think, an important signal to send.\par \par \uc2 On the other side, you know, I can appreciate the idea that even though the central expectation is we're not going to have to go to lower deposit\u8212\'20\'14negative deposit rates, I am not so sure it's massively important, I mean, if we recognize it isn't very likely that we\u8212\'20\'14given all the good data\u8212\'20\'14have to go more negative, retaining that option just gives a signal that we stand ready to act. I don't see why we would necessarily give that up.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: The antiestablishment, some would call populist, parties are doing quite well, as you\u8212\'20\'14as we know, in Europe and the world. Do you see any way in which this could potentially influence the setting of monetary policy either through an impact on the economy or through a feeling among council members that if we take a certain course of action, it could inflame or encourage populism?\par \par \uc2 It's really important to emphasize the independence of central banks, that you know, we would be, I think, in violation of our independence if we tried to become political actors and kind of moderated our actions on the basis of some political hypothesis.\par \par \uc2 So no, I don't think there would be any scenario in which a consideration of how it might affect some electoral outcomes or some attitudes could be a part of the monetary policy decisions.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Is there a risk that when central bankers come out and even give economic analysis, that it may just be inflaming the populace a little bit?\par \par \uc2 The alternative narrative is if central bankers held their tongue. So if you're asked the question, if you have a kind of \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  if France had its own currency, the historical average interest rate above Germany was such and such. That's essentially a factual statement. Equally, if the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  of Britain\u8212\'20\'14if trade barriers go up, if there are trade frictions and so on, analytically, here's where we think the steady state level income of the U.K. will arrive. Again, I think that's being politically independent. So it's important because it isn't just opinion and offering an arbitrary opinion, it's transparent. If you're making statements which may have a political impact, it's very important to be able to show the quality of your underlying analysis.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: OK. Let's talk about another country that arguably is more of a risk of leaving the eurozone\u8212\'20\'14or at least was at one time\u8212\'20\'14Greece. There still seems to be a standoff of some sort there over how to go forward: With the \uc2 IMF\uc2 , without the \uc2 IMF\uc2 ? What do you think is the ideal solution there?\par \par \uc2 So I think ultimately this is\u8212\'20\'14has to be led by the politicians. And I think from the point of view of central banking, the uncertainty doesn't help. But after that, the choices to be made are political choices.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: What impact would a worst-case scenario Brexit have on Ireland?\par \par \uc2 The U.K. is a very important trading partner for us. So, for us, you know, we in the Central Bank would fully recognize that anything that reduces the growth rate in the U.K. is going to be a negative for us\u8212\'20\'14you know, not one-for-one, because, you know, we have other drivers of growth, domestic drivers, other trading partners\u8212\'20\'14but it definitely would be a material negative for the Irish economy, no doubt about that.\par \par \uc2 That's reinforced in episodes where you have significant depreciation of sterling against the euro. That devaluation effect clearly is a big challenge for Irish producers, even if there are some benefits for Irish consumers because the strong euro against the sterling means lower consumer prices. So there is a balance there, depending on which part of the Irish economy you're talking about.\par \par \uc2 So, yeah, it's\u8212\'20\'14from a negotiation point of view, from the simple economic effect on Ireland, a deal that limits the scale of trade barriers would be desirable. That's for sure. And then, of course, more broadly, there's a very wide discussion in terms of the political implications of reimposing a border.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: And Ireland is in a difficult spot now, right? Because not only do you have Brexit to contend with, but President Trump's concern about globalization or wanting to roll it back and encourage U.S. firms to invest at home could potentially hurt Ireland's business model of attracting foreign companies. What's the answer there?\par \par \uc2 You have to distinguish within the Irish multinational sector between firms which are in Ireland to sell to Europe, Middle East, other non-U. S. destinations where\u8212\'20\'14versus other firms which are in Ireland but where a lot of their customer base is back in the U.S. And that second category of course would be sensitive to any change in the different tax regimes in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: And getting to this point about firms being in Ireland to go to Europe, with Brexit of course there's the whole passporting question and banks shifting around, so\u8212\'20\'14yeah.\par \par \uc2 Yeah, so that's a special category. So the financial services is definitely\u8212\'20\'14it's a unique category there. But now, I mean, when we think about American firms with service exports out of Ireland, you think more about \uc2 Google\uc2 , Amazon, \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 , the social network-type companies. But financial services, yes, that's a big open question where there's definitely a reasonable amount of inquiries at the moment of firms\u8212\'20\'14London-based firms who are looking to see where should they go in the \uc2 EU\uc2 . There has to be a high level of coordination across \uc2 EU\uc2  regulators. The ideal is that firms recognize that there's a level playing field within the \uc2 EU\uc2 , and so the locational choices are about availability of skilled workers, availably of office blocks, technology, language issues, and tax issues.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Who do you think is going to gain more new jobs? Is it going to be Dublin or Frankfurt?\par \par \uc2 Well, I mean, if you think about the scale of the size of Ireland versus the scale of Germany, I don't think that's the way to think about it. My bet is there's going to be a lot of fragmentation. So if there were some central planner, a central planner might choose to concentrate a lot of this relocation in a small number of locations. But the reality is firms are competitive, they have different strategies, and it may well be the case that some firms make the decision to put people into Frankfurt. The same firm may put a different unit into Dublin, meaning because essentially it is\u8212\'20\'14you know, London is unique. There's no other London in the \uc2 EU\uc2 , whereas other locations in Europe tend to be more specialist in individual niches. So the most likely outcome is\u8212\'20\'14and this is an important, I think, conceptual point is maybe that's OK. If you have an integrated financial system, a common regulatory framework across the \uc2 EU\uc2  and through banking and capital marketing and they integrate well, then the fact that there's a physical decentralization doesn't necessarily imply a major efficiency problem. We'll wait and see.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: And when do you expect to start hearing more public announcements from banks about what they're doing?\par \par \uc2 There may be announcements of plans, but there's usually going to be a process. You know, so if it's a firm that wants to acquire a banking license, it takes a while to work that one out. It's different for a firm that already exists. So, you know, there might be an international bank which already has a banking unit in some \uc2 EU\uc2  country and is essentially announcing a scaling up or a kind of broadening of that activity. That can be announced more quickly than something where there's going to be an evaluation period and so on.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: What about Northern Ireland and Ireland? Is it thinkable that they merge again? This idea has come up in Germany\par \par \uc2 That's far outside my mandate or my responsibility as a central banker, but I think it's probably fair to say there might be more speculation elsewhere than there is inside the island of Ireland.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: OK. So it isn't there yet?\par \par \uc2 No. But I think the important point there is, again, since 1998 there has been a clear framework. The Good Friday Agreement has kind of outlined the nature of cross-border cooperation. It has outlined the scenarios under which integration could be contemplated, but an important precondition for that is that the population in Northern Ireland would want to do this. And that, you know, I don't think there's any sign of that.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: On BRRD [Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive] and bail-in, have these increased financial stability and broken this state-bank link? Italy's set up now a \u8364\'20\'AC20-billion bailout fund. This arguably wasn't really supposed to happen anymore, right?\par \par \uc2 Europe is holding to the requirements with the BRRD. There are precautionary recapitalizations. So, no, I think definitely it is consequential. The big payoff will be over time. Clearly there are still banks now which are dealing with the fallout from the crisis, and dealing with NPLs and so on. But we're setting up structures where, you know, if banks get into trouble that there are layers of protection. There are bail-in layers before any question of implications for taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 The combination of BRRD, single supervisory mechanism and so on is really transformative.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Valerie Abend, managing director at Accenture Security-Financial Services, North America, discusses the changes financial institutions are making in using risk management as part of their cybersecurity programs, and what else besides technology firms can use to fight hackers.\par \par \uc2 How have cybersecurity defenses evolved in the past five years?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abend: There is clearly a shift toward innovation, harnessing the capabilities of the cloud as a meaningful way to lower expenses while improving the ability to do things like \b \highlight22\uc2 big data analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . When you can harness a secure cloud with data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and with anomalous tools it sets a baseline behavior to be able to detect through a \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  set when things look not quite right. Then, on top of that, layering additional tools around \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to be able to cut out a lot of the noise of what used to be a very manual and expensive exercise. So our most mature capabilities are looking at ways not only to apply capabilities in a commercial sense but in a security sense. Enhancing cybersecurity is what we think is the future and what we are talking about a lot to our clients.\par \par \uc2 What's driving the changes?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abend: Ten years ago the focus was on protecting the perimeter, as we had seen an increase of devices and an increase in the interconnectedness of third parties for the purpose of efficiencies. That led to an inability to define where the perimeter starts; the ecosystem has been pushed out and the number of endpoints is enormous. There is a need to work together collectively and how to go after managing the threats and the vulnerabilities these threats are taking advantage of. The sector is coming together to talk collaboratively about what we can do through partnerships to manage risk from a critical infrastructure perspective.\par \par \uc2 Have the changes in approach and who is in charge made financial institutions safer?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abend: One of the things we hear routinely are questions by the board about whether the investments they are making are going to the right places, going to the things that not just make them more secure but more resilient. It has to do with the idea the bad guys are going to find their way in so it's how you manage that through the whole process and how you remediate that before it becomes a problem. That is something we are spending a lot of time working with our clients on. What see are a lot of different ways to measure this and there needs to be some flexibility to measure in a way that is meaningful to the business because each business has to own its risk profile tolerances.\par \par \uc2 How does a company achieve that?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abend: There is a lot of need for talent in this space and finding the right talent that fits with the culture of the institution, someone who understands and communicates with the board and senior business leaders and also understands how to communicate with regulators. That is a unique talent. There are a lot of very technically capable people fighting in the trenches but you need a really strong leader to set out the strategy for how to do it--and to have the communication skills to explain why the strategy is the right strategy and that this is the way to measure risk appropriately.\par \par \uc2 What technological and strategic tools are available?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abend: Bad guys are using people, process and technology to attack us and we have to use people, process and technology to defend ourselves. There are a lot of tools and one of the things we are hearing from our clients and from financial institutions is there are so many tools, how do you know which ones are right? It's getting hard for somebody who wants to appear innovative to also manage this other aspect that it's going to work and going to be able to ensure the program will be around for a long period of time. The last thing you want to do is spend money and it doesn't survive.\par \par \uc2 What else besides technology is needed?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abend: When we talk about setting risk culture across an enterprise, every single person that has a role within the organization at some level is managing cyberrisk, which is why we have such a push toward training. That people angle, managing the people to say you have a role and responsibility that your network-connected devices are secure, all of us have a responsibility with that.\par \par \uc2 On the process angle, some of these attacks are not using very sophisticated tools, what they are using are very sophisticated business processes and that is where the organization component for the bad guy really is coming into play. The institution has this need to have an organizational process that is well-documented about how they are going to detect and respond when they see sophisticated attacks. If you are a bad guy inside, not only are you learning about the intellectual property but you are learning who has access to it from the standpoint of employees or third parties, how they access it, at what times of day they access it. Learning that process informs you about when you will try to access it and how the company will respond, so you know how to thwart them to get the information out.\par \par \uc2 How should critical infrastructure defenses be prepared?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abend: At the top of the house, at the board level, this is the number one, two or three topic of discussion. The attention and focus were not always there but it's definitely there now. With that comes the ability to have more robust dialogue, not only within the institution but with partners in the public-private space and with government. The big thing is there is no time to waste, the time to prepare is now, in advance of a crisis.\par \par \uc2 (Ben DiPietro is an editor and reporter for Risk & Compliance Journal.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 HONG KONG\u8212\'20\'14The arms race between \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . and its rivals in Asia is heating up.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 After selling its China operations}}}\uc2  to a local rival, Uber faces another expensive fight in the heavily populated market of Indonesia. Local rival Go-Jek is in the process of raising between $500 million and $1 billion in its latest funding round that could hang a roughly $2 billion "pre-money" valuation on the startup, according to people familiar with the situation.\par \par \uc2 A pre-money valuation refers to the value of the startup before fresh funds are included.\par \par \uc2 The fundraising comes after Grab, a ride-hailing competitor based in Singapore, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-rival-grabtaxi-rolls-out-indonesia-investment-plan-1486012764"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pledged to invest $700 million}}}\uc2  in the Indonesian market.\par \par \uc2 The Southeast Asian ride-hailing market has become the latest hotly contested sector for venture-capital-backed startups. The region is a potentially lucrative battleground with its ride-hailing market forecast to grow 18% annually to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion in 2015, according to a report by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and Singapore state investment firm \uc2 Temasek Holdings Pvt. Ltd\uc2 . By contrast, growth in the U.S. market is already slowing. Research firm \uc2 eMarketer\uc2  predicts that the number of people who use a ride-hailing service in the U.S. will rise 7.2% in 2018, compared with an estimated 13% gain this year.\par \par \uc2 In terms of downloads in Southeast Asia, Grab and Go-Jek are ahead of Uber, according to data from San Francisco-based mobile-apps \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Sensor Tower. In the fourth quarter, Grab's app was downloaded 6.7 million times in the region's six largest markets where it competes with Uber, compared with the U.S. company's 5.3 million downloads. In Indonesia, Go-Jek had 147,000 more downloads than Uber in the same period.\par \par \uc2 Uber has already set up a foreign investment company in Indonesia and has a presence in Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Yogyakarta and Bali. Uber has also added a two-wheeler hailing service called UberMoto and chauffeur-driven rental cars in Bali.\par \par \uc2 Indonesia is Grab's largest market by completed rides across all platforms, the company has said, without disclosing daily ridership. Its car and motorcycle-taxi hailing businesses each grew more than fivefold in the country last year from 2015, generating more than $260 million in income for drivers in the country, the company said.\par \par \uc2 Go-Jek has recently been seeking to raise funds in China, including from internet major \uc2 Tencent Holdings Ltd\uc2 ., after a roadshow to pitch the startup to prospective investors there, according to the people familiar with the matter. The Information earlier reported that Tencent was in talks for an investment.\par \par \uc2 Go-Jek didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Tencent declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The new round of fundraising comes after Go-Jek raised $550 million from a clutch of investors including private-equity firms \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Warburg Pincus LLC\uc2  in August.\par \par \uc2 Investors world-wide are pouring money into ride-hailing apps that are burning cash as they fund subsidies to attract drivers. Go-Jek offers inexpensive, on-demand motorcycle taxis that can be booked through smartphones. The company offers fixed prices and pickups, meaning passengers don't need to haggle over fares with drivers at motorbike stands.

Toss has become a top-five payments app in Asia by transaction volume in the two years since its launch, having processed about Won2tn ($1.7bn) in transactions and gained more than 5m customers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe see great opportunities in the country\u8217\'20\'19s financial services sector, where 90 per cent of banking transactions are done mobile or online,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Lee. \u8220\'20\'1CBut there are not many innovative fintech services as regulations discourage new attempts.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Lee\u8217\'20\'19s company, Viva Republica, is one of the few successful ventures in South Korea\u8217\'20\'19s nascent financial technology service sector.\par \par \uc2 South Korea has one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s highest broadband penetrations, fast mobile internet speeds and very high smartphone usage, but industry watchers say the advanced telecoms network has not led to high-value innovation. Fintech is not the only concern \u8212\'20\'14 there is growing fear that the country is falling behind in high-tech software and service development including the internet of things, online-to-offline services (promoting physical stores), \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis because of red tape and a risk-averse culture.\par \par \uc2 A survey commissioned by \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 , the US telecoms group, found many South Koreans feel the country is poor at fostering and protecting technology innovation, surprising some outsiders who see it as a tech powerhouse. The Bloomberg Innovation Index last year ranked South Korea as the world\u8217\'20\'19s most innovative economy, ahead of Germany and Japan, based on indicators such as research and development capability, tech density and patent activity.\par \par \uc2 Led by large technology companies such as \uc2 Samsung\uc2  and \uc2 LG Electronics\uc2 , South Korea spends more on R&D than most other advanced economies. This year it was only narrowly beaten by Israel as the top R&D spender, shelling out 4.23 per cent of GDP compared with Israel\u8217\'20\'19s 4.25 per cent.\par \par \uc2 However, many South Koreans worry that the country is losing its innovative edge as conglomerates such as Samsung focus on hardware, despite growth in the IT industry shifting to software and services. The government has made support for start-up companies central to its policy agenda \u8212\'20\'14 but so far there are few cutting-edge technology start-ups with international reach.\par \par \uc2 South Korea had a popular social networking site called Cyworld, launched in 1999 \u8212\'20\'14 before \uc2 Facebook\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 but its failure to expand abroad due to language and cultural barriers undermined it at home. The country\u8217\'20\'19s dominant messenger app, KakaoTalk, has tried to go global but made little headway.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are few start-ups with really innovative services, with many of them trying to introduce copycat versions of proven overseas models to Korea,\u8221\'20\'1D says Lee Taek-kyung, head of angel investor network Mashup Angels.\par \par \uc2 Although the funding for start-ups has improved under the current administration, which is investing billions of dollars in small companies, they still struggle to grow in the shadow of the big conglomerates \u8212\'20\'14 or chaebol \u8212\'20\'14 which are dominant in most industries.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CChaebol dominance in manufacturing and distribution raises entry barriers for start-ups,\u8221\'20\'1D says Kang Jeong-soo, director of the Institute for the Digital Society. \u8220\'20\'1CThe government should focus on offering a level playing field for smaller companies.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Experts say outdated regulation often blocks innovative ideas. Uber has suspended its ride-sharing service, UberX, in South Korea, bowing to regulatory pressure and protests from taxi drivers. \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 , the peer-to-peer holiday rentals service, is grappling with tough regulations restricting its business. \uc2 Google\uc2  offers a limited mapping service in South Korea due to the country\u8217\'20\'19s national security laws. South Korea\u8217\'20\'19s internet-only banks have yet to start operations due to regulations limiting non-financial companies\u8217\'20\'19 investment in the sector. Strict regulations around testing autonomous driving technologies and flying drones have also come under fire for hindering technology development.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn Korea, it\u8217\'20\'19s only legal if the law says it\u8217\'20\'19s legal. In the US, it\u8217\'20\'19s only illegal if the law says it\u8217\'20\'19s illegal,\u8221\'20\'1D says Tim Chae, partner at 500 Startups, a venture capital based in Silicon Valley. \u8220\'20\'1CThe latter optimises for innovation, the former optimises for the status quo. That\u8217\'20\'19s probably the single biggest thing that needs to change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The country\u8217\'20\'19s rigid corporate culture and education system are also seen as drags on innovation. Software remains a weakness of Korean tech companies such as \uc2 Samsung\uc2  as their top-down culture hinders creativity. \u8220\'20\'1COur conformist, military-style corporate culture does not allow out-of-the-box thinking,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Lee at Mashup Angels.\par \par \uc2 South Korea boasts one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most highly educated workforces but experts say the school system\u8217\'20\'19s focus on rote learning is not suitable for nurturing innovative talents.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur schools are still run like a brick factory designed to churn out as many bricks as possible,\u8221\'20\'1D says Lee Kark-bum, head of Future Thinknet, a research institute. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is hard to cultivate risk-taking, innovative talents under the current education system,\u8221\'20\'1D he adds.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170216ed2g001bk\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2  agreed to buy asset manager Fortress Investment Group LLC for $3.3 billion, a surprising move that is part of an effort by the Japanese technology firm to transform itself into one of the world's largest investment firms.\par \par \uc2 Fortress Class A stockholders are to get $8.08 a share, the companies announced late Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal reported on the deal. That is 39% above the closing price Monday, excluding dividends. The shares surged about 6% Tuesday before word of the acquisition surfaced.\par \par \uc2 The move surprised some SoftBank watchers. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 , run by \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , one of the best-known and most-colorful Japanese businessmen, is known for bold acquisition moves in the technology and communications arena. In September, for example, SoftBank purchased \uc2 ARM Holdings PLC\uc2 , a U.K. designer of microprocessors, for about $32 billion; in 2013, it acquired control of U.S. mobile-phone carrier \uc2 Sprint Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Fortress acquisition fits Mr. Son's ambitious long-term plans to become one of the world's biggest asset managers, focusing on technology but with a broader platform to raise money and shepherd companies across different sectors. In a statement, Mr. Son said the acquisition, along with a gigantic investment fund he is creating, will speed up a transformation aimed at long-term growth.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son is spearheading the $100 billion fund to help put his company and investors at the forefront of emerging technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the Internet of Things, in which everyday objects such as thermostats, watches and cars are connected online.\par \par \uc2 Fortress, which is listed on the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2 , manages about $70 billion in assets and invests in real estate, credit and private equity. The firm was founded in 1998 and is led by Chief Executive Randy Nardone, who, along with \uc2 Pete Briger\uc2  and Wes Edens, will continue to lead Fortress.\par \par \uc2 The firm will continue to operate independently within SoftBank and be based in New York.\par \par \uc2 Alternative-asset managers like Fortress have emerged as appealing targets to some, in part because they are able to charge higher fees and typically require long-term investments from backers. Revenue at traditional money-management firms has been squeezed in recent years by the growing popularity of low-cost index-tracking funds and a difficult environment for stock pickers.\par \par \uc2 Fortress was the first U.S. hedge-fund manager to sell shares to the public, in early 2007. Its public offering raised more than $600 million at a frothy time in the markets and when hedge-fund assets were swelling. It valued the company at more than $7 billion, with the shares debuting at $35 each -- almost double their offering price and well above what it is selling for now.\par \par \uc2 The IPO was billed as a move toward "democratizing" hedge- and private-equity funds, which have long been reserved for the wealthy and big institutional investors such as pension funds.\par \par \uc2 But Fortress's shares soon slid as the financial crisis broadly hit the returns of private investment funds.\par \par \uc2 Today it is one of many publicly traded U.S. asset-management firms, including several focused on alternative asset classes. Fortress shares have had a boost in recent months as some financial stocks gained ground. They were up 28% so far this year and rose 25% after hours to $7.75.\par \par \uc2 Despite recent success in credit investing, Fortress hasn't been immune from a yearslong slump in hedge-fund performance. The firm in recent years shut down a fund that bet on global macroeconomic shifts, though it still has a credit business. In addition to its alternative strategies, Fortress also owns Logan Circle Partners, a fixed-income investing unit.\par \par \uc2 Foreign investors, particularly from Asia, have been shopping for financial-services assets in the U.S. in recent years. Singapore-based Shanda Group, which bought a stake in \uc2 Legg Mason Inc\uc2 . last year, has said it plans to increase that position to 15% from 10%, for example.\par \par \uc2 London-based bankers Nizar Al-Bassam and Dalinc Ariburnu, of investment firm \uc2 F.A.B. Partners\uc2 , helped arrange Tuesday's deal and are advisers to SoftBank's new investment vehicle, known as the Vision Fund. Messrs. Al-Bassam and Ariburnu previously worked with the head of the fund, \uc2 Rajeev Misra\uc2 , at \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2 . Mr. Misra worked at Fortress for less than a year before he joined SoftBank in 2014.\par \par \uc2 The F.A.B. bankers since December have been working on the Fortress deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  executives and their advisers have internally discussed a target for doubling Fortress's assets in the next three years.\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170215ed2g0001j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Equity trading volume was also unusually high on Tuesday, spiking initially in the minutes before the first options trade and then continuing through the afternoon as speculators noticed and then aped the activity.\par \par \uc2 The developments were noted with dismay inside Fortress, where the share price appreciation was eroding the premium that its founders would be able to boast SoftBank was paying over the prevailing market price. The $8.08-per-share takeover price, announced after the market closed, compared to $5.83 at the start of the day but only to $6.21 at the close of trading.\par \par \uc2 Much of the options trading volume that went through on Tuesday appears to have been taken off on Wednesday, suggesting that whoever made the bet has been taking profits on the position, said \uc2 Jim Strugger\uc2 , head of derivatives products at \uc2 MKM Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Strugger said the pre-deal trading was \u8220\'20\'1Cpeculiar\u8221\'20\'1D, although with Fortress due to report results on February 23, it could be that it was a coincidence and an investor was betting instead on improved earnings.\par \par \uc2 The total volume of Fortress call options traded on Tuesday was 9,601, according to Trade Alert, an options \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  data provider, a jump from the average daily volume of 1,124 contracts.\par \par \uc2 Purchases of short dated call options for Fortress expiring in March followed a spike in trading activity in Fortress shares, several hours before news of the takeover became public.\par \par \uc2 Traders in New York said they spotted unusual purchases of Fortress options at around 12.22pm.\par \par \uc2 Henry Schwartz, chief executive of Trade Alert, said that it was unclear whether the options market had responded to the rise in Fortress shares.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s hard to determine if the option trader may have taken a cue from the stock, or if perhaps the same buyer was active in both options and stock,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe buyer used a smart router for most of the volume, which is a way to maximise liquidity without exposing the identity of the buyer,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Schwartz and Mr Gottlieb both estimated that the profit on the trade was in the region of 400 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The large amount of trading nearly doubled the quantity of calls outstanding, with the trading volume ahead of the deal being the largest in one day since April 2016.\par \par \uc2 Large options trades ahead of takeover announcements are closely scrutinised by financial regulators as they have in the past been linked to insider trading cases.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, a former executive of \uc2 Banco Santander\uc2  was fined by the \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  for buying up speculative derivatives in \uc2 PotashCorp\uc2  ahead of \uc2 BHP Billiton\uc2  making an offer for the company.\par \par \uc2 The SEC declined to comment on the Fortress trades. Fortress and SoftBank declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Call options give the owner the right to buy shares in a company for a fixed price by a certain date. If the price does not exceed the strike price by that date they expire worthless.\par \par \uc2 By buying options expiring in only a month \u8212\'20\'14 instruments that are treated as highly speculative by traders due to their short duration and sensitivity to movements in the price of the underlying shares they are linked to \u8212\'20\'14 the purchasers managed to guarantee the largest possible gain on any instrument linked to the value of Fortress\u8217\'20\'19s shares.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170215ed2f00asx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Attention Wall Street: \uc2 Instagram\uc2  is looking to hire.\par \par \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 .'s photo-sharing app plans to double its engineering staff in New York this year to 150 people. In particular, it is looking for \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  experts, many of whom work for hedge funds or investment banks. These "recovering quants"\u8212\'20\'14as Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger calls them\u8212\'20\'14will allow \uc2 Instagram\uc2  to more personally tailor its feed and other features to its 600 million users.\par \par \uc2 The move signals a new stage of growth for \uc2 Instagram\uc2 . The expansion of its New York office\u8212\'20\'14which it expects will have half of the company's engineers by the end of next year\u8212\'20\'14means \uc2 Instagram\uc2  can "tackle a broader portfolio of things within the product," Mr. Krieger said. \uc2 Instagram\uc2  is adding more employees more rapidly than ever; it has already outgrown its brand-new offices in Menlo Park, Calif., which opened just last fall.\par \par \uc2 The amped-up presence in New York is unusual for \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , which likes to keep the bulk of its engineers close to the group's headquarters. But other factors, including tighter competition for engineers in Silicon Valley, prompted \uc2 Instagram\uc2  to look elsewhere. The company also has a big base in Seattle, \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .'s hometown.\par \par \uc2 Most of \uc2 Instagram\uc2 's New York-based engineers will be experts in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a branch of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  that enables computers to learn from enormous data sets with minimal human input.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and personalization are at the heart of some of \uc2 Instagram\uc2 's top projects, such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/03/15/instagram-testing-new-algorithm-driven-feed/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a change to its feed a year ago}}}\uc2  that replaced its reverse-chronological feed with a ranked feed, reordered with posts \uc2 Instagram\uc2  predicted users would find interesting at the top. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has had a ranked feed since 2006.\par \par \uc2 Instagram\uc2  also uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to assemble its "Top Live" feature, found on the Explore tab, which shows a montage of the best live-videos on \uc2 Instagram\uc2  world-wide. \uc2 Instagram\uc2 's safety team uses the technology to detect abusive comments.\par \par \uc2 These tools came in handy {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-unveils-instagram-stories-1470146403"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 during last year's launch of Stories}}}\uc2 , a feature that lets users post photos and videos that vanish after 24 hours. The order of the stories at the top of users' feeds is ranked based on \uc2 Instagram\uc2 's predictions of what a user will find most interesting.\par \par \uc2 Instagram\uc2  is also exploring a way to create thematic Stories, centered around a current event such as last month's Women's March or a topic like cooking, using \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said Blake Barnes, \uc2 Instagram\uc2 's product management director overseeing the New York expansion. That effort, which would allow it to personalize thematic stories for each user, would be powered by \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Snapchat, the disappearing-chat app owned by \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 ., has a similar feature through its own Stories tab, but it is hand-curated.\par \par \uc2 "The arc for us is to try to figure out how people can see what else is going on in the world that's relevant to them," Mr. Barnes said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Deepa Seetharaman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170215ed2f0043b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 SoftBank purchased ARM Holdings for $32 billion in September. An earlier version of this article misstated the price.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2  agreed to buy asset manager Fortress Investment Group LLC for $3.3 billion, in a surprising move that is part of an effort by the Japanese technology giant to transform itself into one of the world's largest investment firms.\par \par \uc2 Fortress Class A stockholders are to get $8.08 a share, the companies announced late Tuesday after The Wall Street Journal reported on the deal. That is 39% above the closing price Monday, excluding dividends. The shares surged by about 6% Tuesday before word of the acquisition surfaced.\par \par \uc2 The move took some SoftBank watchers by surprise. The company, run by \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , one of the best-known and most-colorful Japanese businessmen, is known for bold acquisition moves in the technology and communications arena. In September, for example, SoftBank purchased \uc2 ARM Holdings PLC\uc2 , a U.K. designer of microprocessors, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-buy-arm-holdings-for-more-than-32-billion-1468808434"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 for about $32 billion}}}\uc2 ; in 2013, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323683504578566982888488180"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 it acquired control}}}\uc2  of U.S. mobile-phone carrier \uc2 Sprint Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Fortress acquisition nonetheless fits Mr. Son's ambitious long-term plans to become one of the world's biggest asset managers, focusing on technology but with a broader platform to raise money and shepherd companies across different sectors. In a statement, Mr. Son said the acquisition, along with a gigantic investment fund he's creating, will speed up a transformation aimed at long-term growth.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son is spearheading the $100 billion fund to help put his company and investors at the forefront of emerging technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the Internet of Things, in which everyday objects such as thermostats, watches and cars are connected online.\par \par \uc2 The deal will make SoftBank one of the biggest alternative asset managers in the world. Fortress, which is listed on the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2 , manages about $70 billion in assets and invests in real estate, credit and private equity. The firm was founded in 1998 and is led by Chief Executive Randy Nardone, who, along with \uc2 Pete Briger\uc2  and Wes Edens, will continue to lead Fortress.\par \par \uc2 The firm will continue to operate independently within SoftBank and be based in New York.\par \par \uc2 So-called alternative-asset managers like Fortress have emerged as appealing targets to some in part because they are able to charge higher fees and typically require long-term investments from backers. Revenue at traditional money management firms has been squeezed in recent years by the growing popularity of low-cost index-tracking funds and a difficult environment for stock pickers.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  gains a global network of investors that could help it find and structure deals. It also picks up an asset-management back office\u8212\'20\'14compliance, legal and other functions\u8212\'20\'14that could help as it builds out its own investing business.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  believes it can double Fortress's assets in the next few years, partly by shopping its funds to Mr. Son's network of sovereign funds and global billionaires, according to people familiar with the matter. It plans to sell a slice of Fortress's operating unit, known as the general partner, to some in that network, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Fortress was the first U.S. hedge-fund manager to sell shares to the public, in early 2007. Its public offering raised more than $600 million at a frothy time in the markets and when hedge-fund assets were swelling. It valued the company at more than $7 billion, with the shares debuting at $35 each\u8212\'20\'14almost double their offering price and well above what it is selling for now.\par \par \uc2 The IPO was billed as a move toward \u8216\'20\'18democratizing' hedge- and private-equity funds, which have long been reserved for the wealthy and big institutional investors such as pension funds.\par \par \uc2 But Fortress's shares soon slid as the financial crisis broadly hit the returns of private investment funds.\par \par \uc2 Today it is one of many publicly traded U.S. asset management firms, including several focused on so-called alternative asset classes. Fortress shares have had a boost in recent months as some financial stocks gained ground. They were up 28% so far this year and rose 25% after hours to $7.75.\par \par \uc2 Despite recent success in credit investing, Fortress hasn't been immune from a yearslong slump in hedge-fund performance. The firm in recent years shut down a fund that bet on global macroeconomic shifts, though it still has a credit business. In addition to its alternative strategies, Fortress also owns Logan Circle Partners, a fixed-income investing unit.\par \par \uc2 Foreign investors, particularly from Asia, have been shopping for financial-services assets in the U.S. in recent years. Singapore-based Shanda Group, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/legg-mason-deepens-ties-with-largest-shareholder-shanda-group-1482154017"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 which bought a stake}}}\uc2  in \uc2 Legg Mason Inc\uc2 . last year, has said it plans to increase that position to 15% from 10%, for example.\par \par \uc2 London-based bankers Nizar Al-Bassam and Dalinc Ariburnu, of investment firm \uc2 F.A.B.

The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122693827604333637"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SEC alleged }}}\uc2  that Mr. Cuban traded on confidential information by selling his stake in an Internet-search company, \uc2 Mamma.com\uc2  , in 2004 after being told about the firm's planned offering of new shares, which was likely to trigger a decline in the stock's price.\par \par \uc2 The Cuban case partly turned on whether the billionaire investor had agreed not to sell his stock when he learned about the new offering. A Dallas jury ultimately decided the answer was no.\par \par \uc2 In September, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-charges-leon-cooperman-with-insider-trading-1474470504"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the SEC accused Mr. Cooperman }}}\uc2 , the founder of \uc2 Omega Advisors Inc\uc2  ., of similarly agreeing to refrain from trading on confidential information that he received. As in the Cuban case, the SEC alleges that by violating that agreement, Mr. Cooperman broke securities laws. He has denied wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 At a federal court hearing last week, Mr. Cooperman's lawyers argued the SEC's case doesn't hold up if the agency can't show the agreement preceded the passing of information. (The SEC disputes this.) If the information was freely given by the company, and then Mr. Cooperman agreed not to trade but did, well then that's just a broken promise, his lawyers argue. But it's not insider trading.\par \par \uc2 Like Mr. Cuban's case, the Cooperman claims appear headed to trial. The outcome could turn on the credibility of the SEC's witnesses and Mr. Cooperman's explanation for his trades in \uc2 Atlas Pipeline Partners LP\uc2  . In the Cuban case, the SEC suffered because its key witness\u8212\'20\'14the executive who told Mr. Cuban about the offering\u8212\'20\'14declined to testify in person.\par \par \uc2 An SEC victory could erase some of the shame of losing to Mr. Cuban, who after winning went on the warpath against the agency. Mr. Cuban crashed an SEC legal conference in Washington and trolled the agency's chairman with a tweetstorm, saying she showed a "lack of self awareness."\par \par \uc2 A win also could buttress a theory of insider trading that wasn't resolved in the Cuban battle: namely, that traders commit fraud if they vow to not trade on material nonpublic information and then break that promise. The SEC says one of its rules plainly labels this as fraud, but the agency's view hasn't been addressed by a court decision, said Jill Fisch, a securities law expert at the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2  Law School. A court decision affirming the SEC's view would further expand what constitutes insider trading, which isn't defined in the law and has evolved over time through judicial decisions.\par \par \uc2 At {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-questions-coopermans-bid-to-get-insider-trading-suit-dismissed-1486498437"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 last week's hearing in Philadelphia }}}\uc2 , the two sides faced off over how that rule should apply. The hedge-fund manager's lawyers said it doesn't fit Mr. Cooperman's case, while the SEC said the defense was trying to create a "loophole" in the rule where none exists.\par \par \uc2 "I think the SEC would like to win on a case like this because they would like to establish the legal issues, and would like a judge to hold that it's valid," Ms. Fisch said. "Part of the reason the SEC fought so hard in Cuban is because it wanted to establish...that this was a legitimate theory of insider trading."\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro First: The Dodd-Frank Rule Banks Want to Keep\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 Republican promises to dismantle the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul may prove good news for many financial firms. The bad news for Wall Street: A top target is a provision big banks would rather retain.\par \par \uc2 "Orderly liquidation authority," or OLA, was an answer to the 2008 bailouts of Wall Street firms during the financial crisis. It empowers the federal government to take over and wind down a failing financial firm. Conservatives have sought for years to repeal OLA. Now Trump administration officials are talking about doing so, providing new momentum.\par \par \uc2 OLA is a particularly ripe target with partisan tensions boiling on Capitol Hill. That is the result of quirks in congressional budget rules, which say that because OLA repeal has an impact on the federal budget, it could be passed with a simple majority vote and clear the Senate with only GOP votes.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, other Republican-favored changes to Dodd-Frank, such as stripping the government of powers to extend more stringent oversight to big nonbank firms, would require some Democratic support to clear a higher vote hurdle.\par \par \uc2 Killing OLA has also been scored as creating $15.2 billion in budget savings over 10 years, according to the \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14about the price tag of other priorities, such as President Donald Trump's planned border wall with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "We are going to probably at some point talk about whether OLA works and whether OLA should ever be triggered, because no one thinks that we really solved \u8216\'20\'18too big to fail,'" White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said in a Wall Street Journal interview, referring to the crisis-era conclusions banks had to be bailed out. He said the administration was contemplating an unspecified executive action related to the policy.\par \par \uc2 Steven Mnuchin, who was confirmed as Treasury secretary Monday, told lawmakers at a Jan. 19 hearing that "I think if we have proper regulation, a lot of the need for Title II also goes away," a reference to the portion of the law that lays out OLA.\par \par \uc2 Many in the financial industry disagree, especially big banks who fear an OLA replacement would be more draconian regulation, both in the U.S. and in other countries where officials view OLA as an important backstop.\par \par \uc2 The Clearing House Association of large banks says OLA is a low-cost "Plan B" now that banks are better prepared for bankruptcy than before the financial crisis, citing "living will" bankruptcy plans that banks such as \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2  . and \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2  . have been working on for years.\par \par \uc2 Tim Pawlenty, chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, said the trade group thinks "some reasonable adjustments would improve" Dodd-Frank, but added: "We don't think Title II is in need of change."\par \par \uc2 The debate over OLA boils down to a fight over how to handle financial crises. Should huge firms fail no matter the cost or should the government have authority to step in if it believes the economy is at risk?\par \par \uc2 Many financiers and policy makers regard OLA as an essential defense against economic catastrophe, a better option for taxpayers than the 2008 bailouts. Back then officials tried letting one firm, \uc2 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc\uc2  ., go through bankruptcy court. When that sparked panic, they turned to another bad option: providing Wall Street firms billions of dollars in taxpayer money in exchange for shares.\par \par \uc2 Under Dodd-Frank, bankruptcy remains the first option. Huge banks now write detailed bankruptcy contingency plans. But if the collapse of a systemically important firm might create Lehman-like chaos, the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2  . has the authority to take over the firm and wait for market calm before selling it off.\par \par \uc2 The FDIC may borrow money from the Treasury to keep the firms' lights on\u8212\'20\'14a backup plan to prevent panic that would ensue if a huge financial firm suddenly didn't open for business. These loans can be recouped by taxing the financial industry later.\par \par \uc2 This "orderly liquidation fund" has become the most controversial part of OLA. Supporters say the temporary loans aren't a bailout. The failing firm's shareholders would be wiped out, management would be fired, and lenders to the failing company would lose money, they say.\par \par \uc2 "It's the one tool to avoid a bailout," Jacob Lew, former Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, said in a recent interview. "In a financial crisis, it would be extremely dangerous to be in a world where there was no mechanism that you had access to, to respond."\par \par \uc2 Conservatives say the temporary loans are a bailout. In their view, the taxpayer funds would go to some of the firm's creditors, creating the perception of a "safety net" that will encourage financiers to take excessive risks.\par \par \uc2 "It's just amazing eight years after the crash that taxpayers are still on the hook for bailing out big banks, but they are under Dodd-Frank," said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Tex.) in a recent radio interview.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hensarling and others including Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Penn.) favor changes to the bankruptcy code that they say would avoid a Lehman-like scenario.\par \par \uc2 "I think we need to look at the bankruptcy code and what we can do as an alternative," Mr. Mnuchin said at the Jan. 19 hearing.\par \par \uc2 This article was available on Pro Financial Regulation first, before being published to wsj.com.

Many companies don't want him to stop there\u8212\'20\'14they are targeting a long-contested provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed in the wake of the dot.com bust.\par \par \uc2 Business groups want to soften a Sarbanes-Oxley rule that requires companies to have auditors weigh in on their "internal controls"\u8212\'20\'14the policies and procedures intended to prevent errors or fraud on their financial statements.\par \par \uc2 Sarbanes-Oxley requires companies to evaluate whether these controls are effective and to have their auditor pass judgment on that assessment. Shareholder advocates say the rule, known as Section 404(b), helps ensure companies are giving accurate numbers to investors. Groups like the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  say the rule is too costly and burdensome for small companies.\par \par \uc2 The fight over the rule has been simmering for years, but both sides say President Trump's antiregulatory push has given it renewed intensity. This "changed the mind-set," said John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who is among those pushing to revamp the rule. "I think with the general sort of regulatory skepticism that goes along with the new administration, you're seeing more of a direct focus on 404."\par \par \uc2 The rule's supporters are girding to defend it. For companies, "it creates a greater sense of accountability that shouldn't go away," said Sandra Peters, head of financial reporting policy for the \uc2 CFA Institute\uc2  , which represents chartered financial analysts who work with individual investors.\par \par \uc2 And change may be coming fast: A coming version of the Financial Choice Act, Republicans' proposed replacement for Dodd-Frank, would apparently relax the Sarbanes-Oxley provision by exempting even more companies from it than had been planned under previous versions of this legislation.\par \par \uc2 The most recent version of the legislation called for raising the threshold under which companies are exempt from the rule to a market capitalization of $250 million. A coming version of the legislation will raise that to $500 million, according to a memo from House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. As things now stand, the current threshold, imposed by Dodd-Frank, is a public float under $75 million.\par \par \uc2 "We feel that dialing back some of those provisions would help spur economic activity and create jobs," said Adam Ingles, head of regulatory risk solutions at MBAF, a Miami-based accounting and consulting firm.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the rule say it is worth the trouble and should apply to companies of all sizes. A 2013 \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  report found companies exempt from it restate their financial statements more often than those that must comply with it.\par \par \uc2 When larger companies began reviewing internal controls more than a decade ago, restatements initially soared, as companies found and fixed flaws in their controls, but subsequently, restatements declined. In 2015, 663 companies restated their financial statements, the fewest since 2002, according to consulting firm Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We don't need people investing in small companies that take off and then die," said Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant.\par \par \uc2 But opponents of the internal-control rule argue that audits cost small companies money they just can't spare. They also maintain the compliance requirement deters companies from going public. "Our investors have told us time and again we would much rather you be spending money on research," said Charles Crain, director of tax and financial-services policy for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, an industry group lobbying for changes in the rule.\par \par \uc2 Regulators and legislators have tried to address small companies' concerns in the past. Besides Dodd-Frank's exemption of the tiniest companies, regulators made their rules for conducting auditor reviews "scalable" for small companies in 2007. The 2012 JOBS Act further exempted new "emerging growth companies" from following the rule.\par \par \uc2 BIO supports an approach, also part of the proposed Choice Act, that would extend the exemption from auditor review for emerging-growth companies for an additional five years, to a total of 10 years, if they have annual revenue below $50 million. That would help small biotech companies with no revenue as they go through the long development period for new drugs, Mr. Crain said.\par \par \uc2 "Our companies need to go public, it is vital to their survival, and once they get there we want to make sure everything goes easily for them," he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Rachel Witkowski contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 (This article is available to Pro Financial Regulation subscribers first, before being published to wsj.com.)\par \par \uc2 Steven Mnuchin Confirmed as Treasury Secretary\par \par \uc2 By Nick Timiraos\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The Senate confirmed financier Steven Mnuchin as the next Treasury secretary in a 53-47 vote Monday evening, placing him in a leading position to advance President Donald Trump's plans to revamp financial regulation and the U.S. tax code.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the only Democrat to join with all of the Senate's Republicans to approve the nomination of Mr. Mnuchin, who was sworn in on Monday night.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin, who served as Mr. Trump's campaign-finance chairman last year, spent 17 years at \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2  . before leaving in 2002 to work in the hedge-fund industry. He co-founded \uc2 Dune Capital Management LP\uc2  and expanded into the entertainment business, financing Hollywood movies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin's role buying and rehabilitating the failed \uc2 IndyMac Bank\uc2  , later rebranded \uc2 OneWest Bank\uc2  , became a key focus of his confirmation battle. He and Republican backers said the financial-crisis era acquisition from the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  demonstrated his business savvy.\par \par \uc2 Democrats opposed Mr. Mnuchin, 54 years old, citing the bank's involvement moving thousands of defaulted mortgages through foreclosure. They also questioned whether the bank had done enough new lending to under-served markets after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 "A president's cabinet provides insight into how they'll govern and what their priorities will be. The president has shown his hand by selecting the most anti-working-class cabinet that we have ever seen," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on the Senate floor Monday.\par \par \uc2 The delay between presidential administrations in filling the Treasury post was the longest in the nation's history, said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah). "None of the allegations my colleagues have raised can stand even a modest amount of scrutiny," he said.\par \par \uc2 The lack of bipartisan support for a Treasury secretary is unusual. Previously, the closest vote for the job came in 2009 for President Barack Obama's first Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, who won confirmation on a 60-34 vote with 10 votes from Republicans. His nomination became controversial after disclosures that Mr. Geithner failed to pay some employment taxes in a timely manner.\par \par \uc2 One question now centers on how Mr. Mnuchin will be able to work with both parties to advance an overhaul of the tax code, an infrastructure-spending package and a rewrite of financial regulations passed by Congress in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have already pressed Mr. Mnuchin to explain how he will uphold a pledge delivered after his nomination was announced last fall to revamp the tax code in a way that provides "no absolute tax cut" for the upper class, a position that would appear very difficult to reconcile with the tax plan Mr. Trump unveiled last year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin faces several immediate tasks. The government's borrowing limit is suspended through March 15, after which it must be raised or suspended again. Independent analysts believe the department can use emergency measures for a few months to prevent the country from being unable to pay certain bills.\par \par \uc2 On the international front, the Treasury Department will be at the locus of decision-making on any changes to sanctions, including against North Korea following a ballistic-missile test last weekend. And officials will prepare this spring the semiannual report to Congress that would identify whether U.S. trading partners, such as China, are manipulating their currencies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin will also need to ramp up hiring at the agencies for dozens of appointed positions, many of which require Senate confirmation that could keep those slots vacant for weeks or months.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin is expected to tap David Malpass, the former chief economist at Bear Stearns, for the Treasury's top international affairs post. Jim Donovan, a senior executive at Goldman Sachs, is being considered for a senior position overseeing domestic finance. Drew Maloney, a Washington lobbyist who is the top government affairs executive at energy supplier \uc2 Hess Corp\uc2  ., is being considered for the top legislative affairs post at the department, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin will bring on another campaign official, Eli Miller, as his chief of staff. He also has recruited several senior advisers, including former BlackRock executive Craig Phillips and Reed Rubinstein, a Washington lawyer who previously held a top post at the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  . Shannon McGahn, a top aide to the Republican leadership of the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  , will also join the department.\par \par \uc2 Yellen Testimony to Be Watched for Hints on Deregulation Concerns\par \par \uc2 By Harriet Torry\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen heads to Capitol Hill this week for two days of so-called Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, named for the 1978 law that required it. She will start at 10 a.m. EST Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, by delivering her monetary policy report and prepared remarks. She will present the same report and remarks to the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  at 10 a.m. Wednesday. On both days, she will take lawmakers' questions, which are likely to focus on the economy, the path of interest rates, the labor market, financial regulation and the potential impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. Here is what to watch for.\par \par \uc2 A March Rate Increase?\par \par \uc2 All ears will be alert for signals about whether the Fed might raise its benchmark federal-funds rate at its next policy meeting March 14-15. Central bank officials lifted it in December to a range between 0.50% and 0.75%, and a March move isn't widely expected. Most economists surveyed recently by The Wall Street Journal expect the next rate increase in June. Investors on Monday saw a roughly 18% chance of a rate rise at the March gathering, according to \uc2 CME Group\uc2  . If Ms. Yellen wants to adjust expectations, her Capitol Hill appearances will be an opportunity to do so. Or she could wait until her next scheduled public speaking engagement on March 3.\par \par \uc2 Some senior Fed officials have raised the prospect of a move next month. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said last week that a March rate increase is "on the table," and San Francisco Fed President John Williams also said recently it might make sense for the central bank to raise interest rates as early as March.\par \par \uc2 Economic Uncertainty\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen likely will be asked to weigh in on the potential economic effects of President Donald Trump's fiscal plans, including talk of boosting infrastructure spending and slashing taxes. She was pressed on this during her congressional testimony in November, and said fiscal policies should be aimed at improving long-run economic growth and productivity. Other Fed officials have been dubious about the need for fiscal stimulus with the jobless rate so low, at 4.8% in January. A surge in government spending could push inflation too high and prompt Fed officials to raise interest rates faster than they currently expect. On monetary policy, Ms. Yellen likely will repeat the message of her remarks in Stanford, Calif., in late January: The Fed favors a gradual approach to raising short-term rates, and the fiscal outlook under Mr. Trump remains unclear.\par \par \uc2 Audit the Fed\par \par \uc2 The Fed faces political pressure from lawmakers\u8212\'20\'14mostly Republicans, but also some Democrats\u8212\'20\'14who hope a Trump White House will embrace their efforts to revamp the central bank. Legislative proposals include measures to subject the Fed to more congressional scrutiny, force it to adopt rules-based policy-making, and limit its discretionary powers. Expect Ms. Yellen to again make the case against these efforts, which she has said would erode the Fed's independence and subject it to political interference that could ultimately harm the economy.\par \par \uc2 Financial Regulation\par \par \uc2 Another area of political tension between the Fed and lawmakers is over financial regulation. Mr. Trump recently signed a memorandum ordering a review of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law that has guided regulators such as the Fed. Lawmakers likely will question Ms. Yellen on her thoughts. In her November testimony, she warned against rolling back some measures, such as capital and liquidity rules, saying they have been critical in making the financial system safer.\par \par \uc2 Will She Stay or Will She Go?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen hasn't said whether she would leave the Fed board of governors when her four-year term as chairwoman ends early next year, if Mr. Trump doesn't nominate her to a second term as Fed leader. He said during the campaign he probably wouldn't. But her 14-year term as a governor expires Jan. 31, 2024, which means she could stay on the board even if she isn't chairwoman. When asked in December whether she might stay, which would be an unusual but not unprecedented move, she said "that's a decision for another day."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: GOP Lawmakers Urge Trump to Scrap More of Dodd-Frank\par \par \uc2 By Rachel Witkowski\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A group of Republicans on the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  wrote President Donald Trump on Monday urging a further revamp of the financial regulatory laws enacted during the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 The letter, signed by Rep. Dave Trott of Michigan and nine other members of the panel, thanked Mr. Trump for making a "critical first step" by issuing orders Feb. 3 that halted part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and required the Treasury Department to review the law's impact. The Republican lawmakers asked for more of Dodd-Frank to be rolled back.\par \par \uc2 "We look forward to working with you to continue to shepherd through regulatory reform and promote policies that level the playing field for fair access to capital," said the letter, also signed by Rep. French Hill of Arkansas, reportedly a potential nominee to be deputy Treasury secretary; Andy Barr of Kentucky; Randy Hultgren of Illinois and Steve Stivers of Ohio.\par \par \uc2 Republicans on the Financial Services Committee have been gearing up to reintroduce a proposal from the panel's chairman, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), to revamp Dodd-Frank, the Financial Choice Act. The proposal, expected as soon as this week, is meant to relieve certain banks of heightened regulatory standards and take away most of the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  's powers.\par \par \uc2 While Dodd-Frank's changes "were sold as making the American financial system safer, they instead transferred power from Main Street to Wall Street," the letter said.\par \par \uc2 Other Republicans who signed the letter were Warren Davidson of Ohio, Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, Roger Williams of Texas and Robert Pittenger of North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Regional Bank CEOs Seek Review of Postcrisis Rules\par \par \uc2 By Donna Borak\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14CEOs of the nation's top regional banks on Monday asked for a sweeping review of postcrisis regulations, saying they have limited financial firms' ability to lend to businesses and consumers.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to congressional leaders, the chiefs of 18 banks\u8212\'20\'14including \uc2 Fifth Third Bancorp\uc2  , U.S. Bank, \uc2 Zions Bancorporation\uc2  , \uc2 BB&T Corp\uc2  . and \uc2 Huntington Bancshares Inc\uc2  .\u8212\'20\'14said now was the "appropriate time" for the new Congress to conduct a thorough review of rules put into place by U.S. bank regulators such as the Federal Reserve and to identify regulations that have "unintended consequences or burdens."\par \par \uc2 The chief executive officers said the review should assess the effect regulations have had on the flow of credit.\par \par \uc2 "We support appropriately tailored regulations to ensure the safety and soundness of all banks, the stability of the financial system and strong consumer protections," they wrote in the letter.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump has vowed to eliminate regulations on U.S. businesses, particularly those that he says have suppressed lending. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump promised to undo a bevy of restrictions on financial firms put into place after the 2008 crisis.\par \par \uc2 "I have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses," Mr. Trump said this month. "They can't borrow money. They just can't get any money because the banks just won't let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank."\par \par \uc2 Bank lending has grown, even though some bankers believe they would be lending more without the new rules. Many data suggest it has been a lack of demand, not supply, that is tamping down borrowing by U.S. companies.\par \par \uc2 The CEOs also cited recent remarks by Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin, who endorsed the view of a regulatory framework based on "complexity and activity, not simply size."\par \par \uc2 Specifically, the CEOs asked Congress to undertake a review of existing regulations based on their risk profile and systemic footprint, eliminate the government's ability to set interchange fees on debit-card transactions, and require regulators to conduct an analysis of the costs of each new regulation.\par \par \uc2 The Fed has already taken steps to loosen the regulatory burden on midsize and regional banks. In January, it freed 20 U.S. banks with less than $250 billion in assets from the subjective portion of its annual stress tests to make the exams less onerous.\par \par \uc2 EU Online-Security Plan Is Criticized\par \par \uc2 By Todd Buell\par \par \uc2 FRANKFURT\u8212\'20\'14Business groups are slamming a \uc2 European Union\uc2  proposal that would require customers to enter extra security information for online purchases above \u8364\'20\'AC10 ($10.64), saying the extra hassle could cut online sales by more than \u8364\'20\'AC11 billion ($11.7 billion) a year.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Banking Authority\uc2  , an EU rule-making body based in London, said it aims to combat fraud by requiring customers to enter extra information, such as a personal identification number, but "will seriously consider" making changes. It plans to announce revisions by the end of this month.\par \par \uc2 Credit-card companies and e-commerce associations worry that if online purchases become too cumbersome customers will abandon them.\par \par \uc2 Consumer advocates, on the other hand, say there is no trade-off between antifraud protections and promoting e-commerce.\par \par \uc2 "We disagree that stringent security measures will put people off," consumer-rights group BEUC said in a written statement. It said instances of online fraud in recent years warrant tougher rules.\par \par \uc2 "The situation needs to be improved quite quickly," said a spokesman for BEUC, Sebastien Pant.\par \par \uc2 Still, even BEUC said it doesn't "see the logic of the \u8364\'20\'AC10 limit," arguing instead that when a buyer is known to a merchant the stricter standards aren't needed.\par \par \uc2 The conflict centers on technical standards to the Payment Services Directive, an EU law designed to ease cross-border payments, which will go into full effect next year. The EBA said it received a record number of responses to its draft standards after publication in August.\par \par \uc2 There was "extremely heated" debate at the EBA's public hearing in September, said Arun Srivastava, a partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie in London who attended the crowded meeting. "I was quite taken aback by the number of people," he said.\par \par \uc2 The retail sector objects to proposed exceptions from so-called Strong Customer Authentication, an industry standard designed to prevent online fraud. Under SCA a buyer would need to use a combination of two elements such as a PIN, authentication code or fingerprint. The EBA proposes exempting online purchases below \u8364\'20\'AC10 from such rules.\par \par \uc2 Retailers and credit-card providers worry that if customers must take extra steps, then they will buy less. Purveyors prefer to set their own rules on how best to combat fraud.\par \par \uc2 Visa Europe\uc2  , the European subsidiary of global payments-technology company \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2  ., estimates that the new EBA rules would put \u8364\'20\'AC11.2 billion of online sales a year in Europe at risk. This equals about 2% of Europe's e-commerce market, which is expected to have exceeded \u8364\'20\'AC510 billion last year. A survey of more than 5,000 adults across Europe, conducted on behalf of Visa, indicated that 61% of consumers would abandon purchases if more steps were added to the online payment process.\par \par \uc2 The industry would prefer to use a system known as Risk Based Authentication, which takes into consideration factors such as whether the retailer's website recognizes the buyer's internet address.\par \par \uc2 "There are existing methods of [customer] authentication, which are more efficient than this two-factor authentication," said David Stephenson, general secretary of the European Card Payment Association, a trade group.\par \par \uc2 The \u8364\'20\'AC10 figure is "completely random and arbitrary," said David Birch, an industry consultant. If there is a black-and-white limit on when the stricter authentication is required, criminals also will know when it will be harder and easier to commit fraud, he said. The airline \uc2 Deutsche Lufthansa AG\uc2  and retailer \uc2 Toys "R" Us Inc\uc2  . could have different limits, for example, he said.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers also question the \u8364\'20\'AC10 limit. Markus Ferber, a German member of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  , said that if the EBA's proposals became law, "many fast payment possibilities, which are valued by customers, would no longer be possible."\par \par \uc2 He said customer-authentication policy should recognize the difference between a customer making a payment from a regular device or location versus the customer "suddenly making transactions from Nigeria."\par \par \uc2 Co-Op Bank Woes Mean Pain for Investors, But How Much?\par \par \uc2 By Margot Patrick\par \par \uc2 LONDON\u8212\'20\'14Britain's \uc2 Co-operative Bank PLC\uc2  could pose a fresh test to the regime for bank bailouts in Europe.\par \par \uc2 Co-op Bank on Monday put itself up for sale, saying it needs more capital and may buy back bonds at a discount. If a buyer doesn't emerge, the lender could be taken over by the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  . Either way, investors in its shares and bonds face potential losses. The question is: how much?\par \par \uc2 Taxpayer bailouts in the financial crisis prompted European policy makers to come up with stricter rules to make shareholders and bondholders bear losses ahead of taxpayers. But the new regime hasn't led to standardized treatment of bondholders at banks nearing failure, and some big U.S. funds have endured losses from authorities' unexpected moves. Co-op Bank on Monday said it continues to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements. It didn't give a deadline for finding a buyer.\par \par \uc2 Under the current EU guidelines, bank shares and bonds must absorb losses\u8212\'20\'14a "bail in"\u8212\'20\'14before a government mounts a bailout. Yet authorities can still protect systemically important banks or investors, and some restructurings have taken longer than anticipated as initial rescue attempts proved insufficient.\par \par \uc2 A state-backed rescue at Italy's \uc2 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA\uc2  is currently challenging the expectations of investors in troubled banks. There, retail investors may get a sweeter offer than international funds in the proposed government plan, which is awaiting \uc2 European Commission\uc2  approval. Or maybe not. Mom-and-pop bondholders were wiped out when a set of smaller Italian banks failed 14 months ago. The Italian government later said some of those investors can be compensated.\par \par \uc2 Before the financial crisis, government-backed bank bailouts had to comply with EU state aid rules, but bondholders were usually repaid as bank after bank neared collapse\u8212\'20\'14a situation that looked unfair to many taxpayers, who collectively had paid billions.\par \par \uc2 "The outcome in every case is very specific and the outcome for investors can vary dramatically, from 10 cents to par, depending on the political situation," said Philippe Bodereau, portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Pimco and other U.S. fund managers sued \uc2 Portugal's central bank\uc2  for removing EUR2 billion ($2.13 billion) in bonds for repayment at \uc2 Novo Banco SA\uc2  , a still-troubled lender carved out of the former \uc2 Banco Esp\u237\'00\'EDrito Santo\uc2  . The central bank left retail bonds intact. It said the decision protected Novo Banco's depositors and was in the public interest.\par \par \uc2 In December, as a private recapitalization at Italy's \uc2 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA\uc2  was failing, teams of lawyers and regulatory experts mapped out scenarios for U.S.-based hedge funds and other clients sensing an opportunity to buy the bank's junior bonds at low prices and make a profit if the government engineered a favorable deal. They parsed statements from Italian officials, studied Germany's body language over the brewing problem and brushed up on Italian law, according to people doing the work.\par \par \uc2 "There's a type of investor that is intrigued to find a smart way around these situations and make money from them, and others that don't have the appetite for the detail," said Barney Reynolds, a partner at \uc2 Shearman & Sterling\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Italy's solution\u8212\'20\'14a "precautionary recapitalization" allowed under the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive\u8212\'20\'14was seen as an acceptable result to many institutional investors despite the preferential treatment of retail bondholders. The proposal needs state-aid clearance from the EU executive arm but is expected to be approved.\par \par \uc2 In Britain, Co-op Bank narrowly avoided a taxpayer bailout in 2013 when hedge funds including \uc2 Silver Point Capital\uc2  and Perry Capital converted some bonds to equity and injected new capital. But plans to turn the bank around were stymied by low interest rates and rising capital charges. Now its investors must calculate how they might fare in a private sale or recapitalization, or in a seizure of the lender by the central bank.\par \par \uc2 Some of the mystery around bail-ins may lift once European banks have new bonds in place. Part of the new rules mandate that banks have a certain percentage of loss-absorbing bonds in their funding, and that their rank is clear in relation to other debt and deposits.\par \par \uc2 Despite the precarious state of some European economies, few banks have actually failed or come close in the last few years. A new EU body to handle failing banks, the \uc2 Single Resolution Board\uc2  , is untested.\par \par \uc2 The new bonds present their own issues. There are three ways for banks to give the bonds lower priority in a bailout to other debt and deposits\u8212\'20\'14through structure, contract or national law. The scope of future bail-ins could hinge on the nuances.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot more factors involved then there were a few years ago. It makes the job of the investor to understand the bond they are buying and how it will operate more challenging." said Tom Grant, a partner at \uc2 Allen & Overy\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 NY State Law to Increase Cyberinsurance Demand\par \par \uc2 New York cybersecurity regulations going into effect March 1 could increase demand for cyberinsurance and directors-and-officers insurance, Fitch says. The regulations will require 3,000 financial institutions to establish cybersecurity policies and data encryption. Because of the lack of widespread data on cyber risks, "Fitch views substantial growth in stand-alone cyber coverage or higher portfolio concentration in cyber as a credit negative for insurers." (nicole.friedman@wsj.com; @NicoleFriedman)\par \par \uc2 Two Sides of Greenberg's Settlement Size\par \par \uc2 Hank Greenberg's lawyer, David Boies, on Monday called former AIG CEO Hank Greenberg's $9M agreement to resolve 12-year-old civil-fraud allegations a "nuisance settlement." The pact was reached by Greenberg and NY's AG Office last week. The state emphasizes the $9M payment by Greenberg is a meaningful amount of money, especially when combined with a $15M settlement by Greenberg with the SEC in 2009. The SEC pact resolved a securities-violation allegation arising out of AIG's accounting. NY's AG highlights that the combined payments represent a lot of past bonus money for Greenberg.

(Ryan.Tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)\par \par \uc2 Democrats Push Trump On Icahn, Ethanol\par \par \uc2 A group of Democrat senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, are sending a letter Monday to President Donald Trump's White House lawyers raising concerns that billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who Trump has tapped as a regulatory adviser, has a conflict of interest because he has been critical of a federal mandate that requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol into gasoline. Icahn owns a small refinery facing high costs to comply with that mandate; he wants the point of compliance changed. Scott Pruitt will have jurisdiction over this mandate, and he largely skirted taking a firm position on this issue in his confirmation hearing a few weeks ago. The senators want answers to a slew of questions before Pruitt is confirmed to lead the EPA, which is expected later this week.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Although 2017 has started off slowly for private companies seeking initial public offerings, \uc2 SailPoint Technologies Inc\uc2 . is betting its continuing revenue growth and a growing need for cybersecurity products will pave the way for a successful public market debut.\par \par \uc2 SailPoint\uc2 , which is backed by private-equity firm Thoma Bravo, is laying the groundwork for a possible IPO filing later this year, according to people familiar with the situation.\par \par \uc2 The Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity company offers identity management software that helps companies monitor security breaches, including those from inside companies themselves, along with other security-related tasks such as password management, compliance control and data access, according to its website. Its customers include \uc2 Weight Watchers International Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Molina Healthcare Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Sallie Mae\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SailPoint\uc2  has made two new hires to help groom it for an IPO filing later this year, if markets are favorable, these people said. In November, the company announced it had appointed Kevin Hansel as chief information officer to support its continued business expansion. More recently, it hired a general counsel, who will join \uc2 SailPoint\uc2  in about two weeks, one of the people said, although this person declined to name the general counsel.\par \par \uc2 "There have been a lot of opportunities that were snatched out of the hands of the public market investors," this person said, noting \uc2 Cisco Systems Inc\uc2 .'s $3.7 billion recent announced acquisition of \uc2 AppDynamics Inc\uc2 . in January, the week of the startup's slated IPO. "[\uc2 SailPoint\uc2 ] is profitable and has the flexibility [to wait] until the market is attractive."\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 SailPoint\uc2  moves forward with its IPO ambitions, it would be one of only a few technology companies braving the public markets so far this year. The highly anticipated IPO of disappearing-message app Snapchat's parent company, \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 ., has attracted attention from investors because of its high private-market valuation and visibility in the social media market.\par \par \uc2 Other companies, such as \b \highlight22\uc2 big data analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company Zeta Global Inc. and enterprise communication software provider \uc2 Asana Inc\uc2 ., are considering possible public offerings in 2017, or have made strategic hires that may indicate a future public listing, according to previous reports in The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2005, \uc2 SailPoint\uc2  received an investment from Thoma Bravo {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0120140813ea8dqxnz3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in 2014}}}\uc2 . Since then, the company's revenue has grown steadily. According to a February 2016 news release, the company's 2015 revenue surpassed $100 million. The firm announced this month that 2016 revenue had grown to more than $130 million, according to a release recapping last year's financial results.\par \par \uc2 In 2016, the company added more than 220 customers, bringing its client base to more than 750, according to the release. Most recently, \uc2 SailPoint\uc2  announced last week it would collaborate with \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . to add identity governance capabilities to \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 's Azure Active Directory, an identity and access management product.\par \par \uc2 It's possible that despite its intent, \uc2 SailPoint\uc2  could get snapped up by a a corporate buyer or a private-equity firm before it enters the public market, given the large amount of capital such firms have available to invest. In December, cybersecurity company \uc2 Optiv Security Inc\uc2 . was purchased by \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . a little less than month after the company, which had been backed by \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2 , disclosed plans for an IPO.\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170214ed2e004ee\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

They face intense pressure to find more effective ways to combat the inexorable rise of low-cost index-tracking funds.\par \par \uc2 This challenge is most acute in the US, where the share of institutional assets allocated to active investment strategies fell from 79 per cent in 2012 to 67 per cent by 2015, according to \uc2 Greenwich Associates\uc2 , the consultancy.\par \par \uc2 But large active fund houses protest these challenges are not insurmountable. Many are preparing a range of tactics to fight back against the rise of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Passive_Investing"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 passive investing }}}\uc2 , which looks set to continue to take market share in the coming years.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Greenwich says around one in five large US investors plan to reduce their allocations to active US equity strategies significantly over the next three years, a trend that is being repeated in other regions where index-tracking funds are proving popular.\par \par \uc2 Recently \uc2 Moody\u8217\'20\'19s\uc2 , the credit rating agency, predicted that the rapidly expanding passive investment market will become larger than the active fund industry in the US by 2024 at the latest, intensifying competitive pressures for stockpicking managers.\par \par \uc2 Andrew McCollum\uc2 , managing director at Greenwich, says success will be \u8220\'20\'1Cdifficult if not impossible\u8221\'20\'1D for active managers that stick to a traditional stockpicking approach, even if they enjoy temporary periods of prosperity with fashionable products or when markets rise.\par \par \uc2 A far bleaker assessment comes from Neil Constable, head of the global equity team at GMO, the $88bn Boston-based investment company that focuses purely on active management. He predicts a \u8220\'20\'1CDarwinian cull\u8221\'20\'1D as \u8220\'20\'1Cthere are too many mediocre active managers out there and they charge a lot\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf an active manager is not generating returns that are reliably better than the market, then they have no business charging a fee for their services,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 GMO, \uc2 Franklin Templeton\uc2 , \uc2 Wells Fargo Asset Management\uc2  and \uc2 Legg Mason\uc2  were among the large US managers that have been hit hardest by investor withdrawals in 2016.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Joe Sullivan\uc2 , chief executive of Legg Mason, the $710bn New York-listed investment manager, insists active managers can overcome the threat from passive without having to go down the route of launching their own index-tracking businesses.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1C[It is an] easy but shallow argument to say that active is dead,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Mr Sullivan believes that future returns from equities and bonds are likely to remain muted. This means investors will require access to less-liquid asset classes such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/stream/topicsId/MTY1MmRjNGYtZWI3Ny00NTE1LTk4MTUtNjk2MTM4Mzg3Y2Nj-VG9waWNz"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 infrastructure }}}\uc2 , property, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Private_equity"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 private equity }}}\uc2  and direct lending. These areas provide more opportunities for active managers, according to the chief executive.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese asset classes have the ability to deliver higher returns than a balanced 60/40 equity-bond portfolio,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, adding that it would be \u8220\'20\'1Cfoolish for anyone to suggest that an investor has all of their money in passive strategies\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Allianz Global Investors\uc2 , BlueBay, M&G and Hermes are among the large fund houses to have increased their focus on niche asset classes such as direct lending and private debt over the past two years. These investment strategies are widely considered difficult to replicate in a passive format.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , the UK\u8217\'20\'19s largest listed asset manager, similarly acquired an investment team focused on asset-backed securities, a niche area of the fixed income market, from Brookfield, the US asset manager, last May. It also entered into a strategic partnership with Neos, the Dutch direct lending firm, in April.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Peter Harrison\uc2 , chief executive of the FTSE 100 fund house, told FTfm last year the logic behind the Brookfield deal was that the investment expertise \uc2 Schroders\uc2  was acquiring was \u8220\'20\'1Cvery hard to disrupt through passive\u8221\'20\'1D.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Euan Munro\uc2 , chief executive of \uc2 Aviva Investors\uc2 , the \u163\'00\'A3319bn asset management arm of Aviva, the UK insurer, agrees active managers can fight back by providing sophisticated investment strategies, such as multi-asset funds, that are not easily replicated by passive indices.\par \par \uc2 He adds that fund managers are turning away from measuring their performance relative to traditional equity benchmarks to focus on providing absolute returns for investors in any market condition. This could help active managers retain business, he believes.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBeating the FTSE 100 or S&P 500 might be evidence of stockpicking skill, but that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t solve a client\u8217\'20\'19s fundamental problems, whether that is saving for a pension or drawing an income for retirement,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Other stockpickers have turned to a second defence strategy: taking more aggressive bets by increasing the active share of their portfolios, which means their funds are less likely to reflect the index they are benchmarked against. \u8220\'20\'1CMany of our managers are running high active-share strategies to deliver alpha,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Sullivan.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Several large active fund companies, including Neptune, Columbia Threadneedle and Baillie Gifford, started to publish measures of the active share of their funds in 2015 to distinguish their strategies from those of their competitors.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A third defence tactic that is being adopted widely is to invest in quantitative strategies, whereby active managers run highly diversified, computer-driven portfolios that invest across a large number of stocks.\par \par \uc2 Quantitative funds fell out of favour after performing badly as a group in the 2007/08 financial crisis. But Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, a strategist at Bernstein Research, the brokerage, says these strategies are no longer stigmatised due to investors\u8217\'20\'19 growing appreciation of the possibilities of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Big_data"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \\b big data\\b0 }}}\uc2  and the wealth of information on the internet. \u8220\'20\'1CActive quantitative managers have an advantage in the use of new data sets that do not use standard accounting data but which require significant computational ability,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 T Rowe Price, the $811bn Baltimore-based manager, launched three quantitatively driven US funds last April, while GAM, the Swiss-listed asset manager, paid $217m to buy Cantab Capital, a quantitative UK hedge fund company, to diversify its active management capabilities in June.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The final prong of the defence strategy employed by many large fund houses has been to hone their expertise and bring in specialists such as actuaries, political strategists and economists to advise on the challenges facing investors in a low-return environment.\par \par \uc2 This has led to an uptick in demand for high-profile political and economic experts at fund houses with large active investment businesses.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Last month \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest fund house, announced it had appointed \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 , the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, as a senior adviser. And in October, RWC, the purely active investment house, announced it had entered a strategic partnership with the consultancy launched by Condoleezza Rice, the former US secretary of state.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Pimco, the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest bond fund house, has similarly enlisted the help of \uc2 Jean-Claude Trichet\uc2  and \uc2 Ben Bernanke\uc2 , the former European and US central bank chiefs respectively, and \uc2 Gordon Brown\uc2 , the former British prime minister, to advise on economic and political events.\par \par \uc2 Mr Fraser-Jenkins says rising investor demand for passive strategies has \u8220\'20\'1Craised the bar\u8221\'20\'1D for success for active managers, who must demonstrate they possess stockpicking skills that can translate into market-beating returns.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COrganisations that fail to embrace these changes risk going the way of the video-rental store,\u8221\'20\'1D says Greenwich\u8217\'20\'19s Mr McCollum.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170213ed2d001bb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

How Durable are His Policies?\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo finally ended speculation about his future Friday with a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/daniel-tarullo-federal-reserve-regulatory-point-man-resigning-1486751401"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 resignation letter to President Donald Trump }}}\uc2 , effective early April. Now comes the final test of his policies: How long will they endure?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo has become a force of nature on financial regulatory policy in large part through consensus building, and the durability of his legacy will depend on whether that consensus holds.\par \par \uc2 Given the opaqueness of decision-making by the Fed's top brass, it's always been hard to discern the precise extent to which Mr. Tarullo influenced outcomes. When the Fed failed \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2  . in its 2014 stress tests, apparently {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303887804579504230938475574"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reversing the expectations }}}\uc2  of Citi's New York supervisors, was that Mr. Tarullo's doing? Would the Fed's capital rules or annual stress tests have been as tough without Mr. Tarullo in the room? On these choices and many others, the Fed doesn't engage in much public debate. But Mr. Tarullo wasn't the only voice, and the final decisions were almost always unanimous.\par \par \uc2 Within the Fed, Chairwoman Janet Yellen and other Fed board members had influence. Their terms will extend beyond April; Ms. Yellen's into early 2018.\par \par \uc2 Fed senior staff also mattered, and many of them will remain on the job long after Mr. Tarullo and Ms. Yellen are gone. (One notable exception is Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez, who said last week he is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-fed-lawyer-scott-alvarez-to-retire-this-year-fed-says-1486571410"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 retiring this year }}}\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 Under Mr. Tarullo, the Fed didn't just rewrite the rulebook, it also restructured to empower staff in the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation. These public servants ultimately answer to political appointees, but their opinions and recommendations count because they, not Fed governors, see what is actually going on inside firms the Fed regulates. Future Fed decisions will be influenced at least in part by these staffers.\par \par \uc2 Outside the Fed, the question is whether Mr. Tarullo has succeeded in convincing other policy makers. He thinks so, telling The Wall Street Journal on Friday that for what he called "core" overhauls, "there will be durability." Those include capital rules, liquidity rules, better risk management, and viable resolution strategies.\par \par \uc2 In one early indicator that support for such policies may outlive Mr. Tarullo, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-fischer-issues-warning-on-bank-capital-requirements-1486818344"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 said Saturday }}}\uc2  that "significantly reducing capital requirements would reduce the safety of the system and we certainly hope it's not going to happen."\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Tarullo's successor isn't convinced and wants to change these rules, he or she will have to bring along other regulators. That includes Mr. Trump's choice for comptroller of the currency and chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., along with other members of the Fed's governing board and, perhaps, regulators in other countries (if internationally agreed regulatory accords are the target).\par \par \uc2 "There is way more of a grounding for this than me," Mr. Tarullo said in the interview, referring to those "core" overhauls. The coming months will bear out whether that is correct, starting with the people Mr. Trump puts in charge.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Mnuchin to Secure Confirmation as Soon as Monday\par \par \uc2 By Nick Timiraos\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The Senate is expected to confirm Steven Mnuchin as the 77th Treasury secretary as soon as Monday night, which would end one of the most protracted confirmation battles for the position and place the 54-year-old financier in a leading position to advance President Donald Trump's promises to refashion the U.S. tax code and financial regulation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin has faced opposition from Democrats for several reasons, including his role rehabilitating the failed \uc2 IndyMac Bank\uc2  , later rebranded \uc2 OneWest Bank\uc2  , by moving thousands of defaulted mortgages through foreclosure.\par \par \uc2 Senators also have raised concerns about answers he provided the committee during the confirmation process pertaining to his complex financial disclosures and his record at OneWest.\par \par \uc2 Already, his confirmation has faced the longest delay of any recent Treasury secretary, and he appears likely to win confirmation for the position with a historically weak margin of support, a pattern reflected with other high-profile Trump nominees.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump was set to meet with Mr. Mnuchin on Sunday afternoon at his private club in Palm Beach, Fla. With Mr. Mnuchin not in office during the first three weeks of the administration, Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs banker named as the director of the White House National Economic Council, has played an increasingly influential role shaping policy on tax, regulation and infrastructure. Mr. Mnuchin spent 17 years at the New York investment bank, leaving in 2002.\par \par \uc2 The vote will take place as senators work to approve remaining Trump administration cabinet appointees. The Senate on Monday also is expected to confirm Dr. David Shulkin as Mr. Trump's secretary of Veterans Affairs. Dr. Shulkin currently serves as the head of the VA's health-care system.\par \par \uc2 That would leave six more Trump cabinet picks whose confirmations are pending, including Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary-designate Rick Perry and Interior Secretary-designate Ryan Zinke. One of the pending nominees, Labor Secretary-designate Andy Puzder, is set to have a confirmation hearing on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 In the Republican-controlled Congress, lawmakers also plan to work this week to undo as many last-minute Obama administration regulations as possible on a simple-majority vote. Among expected targets in the House is a rule that blocks states from denying organizations that provide abortion services access to federal funds available for pregnancy testing and other family-planning services. Federal law prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in the cast of rape, incest, or the endangerment of the mother's life.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin cleared the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month after Democrats boycotted the vote.\par \par \uc2 Democrats said they wanted more information from the nominee, though some had already announced their opposition, and Republicans subsequently suspended the rules to advance his nomination without any Democrats in attendance.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin has rejected Democrats' critiques of his record, and a spokesman has said he has provided truthful answers to their questions. "Since I was first nominated to serve as Treasury secretary, I have been maligned as taking advantage of others' hardships in order to earn a buck. Nothing could be further from the truth," Mr. Mnuchin said at his Jan. 19 confirmation hearing.\par \par \uc2 The partisan row illustrates the challenge facing Mr. Mnuchin in fashioning a tax-code overhaul, infrastructure package, financial-regulation revamp and housing-finance legislation that can attract bipartisan support.\par \par \uc2 For example, Democrats have pressed Mr. Mnuchin to explain how he will uphold a pledge delivered hours after Mr. Trump announced his nomination to revamp the tax code in a way that provides "no absolute tax cut" for the upper class.\par \par \uc2 "He has failed to commit to following his own rule or to provide any specific answers on how we would reduce the tax burden on middle-class and working families," said Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) on the Senate floor last Friday.\par \par \uc2 The responsibilities of the Treasury secretary, who is fifth in the presidential line of succession, include everything from tax collection and fiscal policy to public-debt management, bank regulation and the implementation of international sanctions.\par \par \uc2 One pressing need for the new Treasury secretary will be to raise the government's borrowing limit, currently suspended through March 15, after which the department must use emergency measures to prevent the country from being unable to pay certain bills. Independent analysts believe those measures can last through the summer.\par \par \uc2 At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Mnuchin said he hoped lawmakers would move soon to increase the borrowing limit.\par \par \uc2 He said he believed existing sanctions on Russia should be maintained and he called for a boost in staffing at the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  , where ranks have thinned partly due to spending cuts driven by congressional Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Delays in Mr. Mnuchin's confirmation also have pushed back the process of approvals for top Treasury deputies, meaning it could be weeks or months before those positions are filled. Mr. Mnuchin, who served as the Trump campaign's finance chairman, is expected to bring on another campaign official, Eli Miller, as his chief of staff.\par \par \uc2 He also has recruited two senior advisers, former BlackRock executive Craig Phillips and Reed Rubinstein, a Washington lawyer who previously held a top post at the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Tarullo, Federal Reserve Regulatory Point Man, to Resign\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The Federal Reserve's lead architect of postcrisis financial regulations plans to resign this spring, giving President Donald Trump more freedom to remake the central bank and to accelerate a deregulatory agenda by putting his own appointees in charge of overseeing Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Tarullo, a 64-year-old Fed governor and the government's most influential overseer of the American banking system, wrote to Mr. Trump on Friday saying he would resign "on or about" April 5. The move had been expected, and will remove from the policy-making debate one of the strongest voices for imposing safeguards on big banks and nonbanks to protect against another meltdown. Mr. Trump and many of his advisers have criticized those rules as hampering economic growth, and have suggested they will fill vacancies with officials who will handle banking policy with a lighter touch.\par \par \uc2 Stock prices for megabanks jumped on the news of Mr. Tarullo's imminent departure, with shares in \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2  . and \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2  . rising almost 1% in the half-hour following the announcement.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo's resignation will also give the Trump administration broad discretion to put its own stamp on the central bank at a time when critics\u8212\'20\'14including top Republicans in Congress\u8212\'20\'14have accused the institution of lacking transparency and accountability. The departure could leave vacant three of the seven slots on the Fed's board of governors. In addition, Janet Yellen's term as chairwoman expires early next year.\par \par \uc2 Filling those vacancies would also give the new president the chance to redirect the course of monetary policy, though it is unclear whether he would seek officials who would alter Ms. Yellen's current course of cautious rate increases.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo's announcement came exactly a week after Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing regulators to review the rules implemented since the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, and as Republican lawmakers intensify their plans to rewrite that landmark law. But partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill makes it unlikely Congress can make big changes, leaving it to the regulators Mr. Trump nominates to change the way rules are written, implemented and enforced.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo's term doesn't expire until 2022, but many expected him to step down sooner because Mr. Trump's team wants to appoint someone else to the currently vacant post of Federal Reserve vice chairman in charge of bank oversight. President Barack Obama never filled the job that was created by Dodd-Frank, and let Mr. Tarullo effectively fill it on an informal basis. Mr. Trump's appointment would have diminished Mr. Tarullo's influence.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal Friday he had a "fairly strong presumption"\u8212\'20\'14even before the November election\u8212\'20\'14that he would resign early this year after eight intense years on the job, and the Trump administration didn't ask him to leave.\par \par \uc2 He said it isn't clear yet whether his successor will want to undo financial regulations, and it is "hard to argue with" the regulatory principles Mr. Trump laid out in the executive order. Those principles included analyzing the costs of regulations.\par \par \uc2 "I am hopeful that the core things [the Fed has accomplished]\u8212\'20\'14capital, liquidity, better risk management and viable resolution strategies\u8212\'20\'14are things that will end up and do command a wide enough consensus, particularly for the largest institutions," he said in the interview. "There may be some other changes that I might not fully subscribe to, but that wouldn't cut to the heart of what I think is important for the stability of the American financial system."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump hasn't said whom he will appoint to the Fed board. David Nason, an executive at \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2  .'s financing arm who was an architect of the 2008 bank bailouts during a stint at the Treasury Department, has emerged as a leading candidate for the vice chairman job in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Trump's team has interviewed other candidates, these people said. For instance, Mr. Trump has met with former BB&T Corp. Chief Executive John Allison, who has been critical of what he views as undercapitalized big banks.\par \par \uc2 Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, has said filling the Fed's banking post is a priority for the administration. Mr. Cohn weeks ago left his job as a top executive at \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2  . and said in a Journal interview last week the Fed has clamped down too heavily on banks under Mr. Tarullo's watch\u8212\'20\'14indicating he would favor replacing Mr. Tarullo with somebody who would implement different rules.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo has presided over a significant expansion of the Fed's influence over Wall Street. Some financiers called him the "Wizard of Oz" for his mysterious yet powerful role enforcing bank rules. He came to the Fed as Mr. Obama took office with a mission to overhaul a regulatory system that had just failed to prevent a massive financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Under Mr. Tarullo's watch, the Fed centralized regulatory power in Washington and charted an aggressive course, adopting rules that effectively taxed banks' size\u8212\'20\'14but avoiding directly forcing them to break up, as some industry critics had demanded.\par \par \uc2 He successfully pushed for tighter capital and liquidity requirements on big banks, was a force behind new rules for foreign-owned banks operating on U.S. soil, and helped design and implement new annual "stress tests" that big U.S. banks must pass or face restrictions on their ability to pay dividends.\par \par \uc2 Some of those changes will be hard to undo. There is broad support for tough bank capital rules, and rewriting those would likely require years of work and consensus among several U.S. regulatory agencies.\par \par \uc2 Other changes could happen more quickly. For instance, the Fed's leadership has significant discretion in deciding the toughness of stress tests, and whether banks pass or fail.\par \par \uc2 Supporters say Mr. Tarullo has made banks more resilient, and helped improve their risk management. Fed Up, a liberal activist group that regularly criticizes the central bank, praised Mr. Tarullo in a statement saying it was sorry to see him go. "Tarullo's departure makes all of us more vulnerable to unemployment, loss of wealth, and insecurity," the group said.\par \par \uc2 Critics say his policies have gone overboard, and held the economy back.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo's departure "is good news for our lending markets and good news for consumers of capital," said Richard Farley, a banking lawyer at \uc2 Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP\uc2  . He pointed to the Fed's crackdown during Mr. Tarullo's tenure on banks' lending to highly leveraged companies\u8212\'20\'14a policy that isn't enshrined in federal regulation and could be walked back under new leadership.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump also could install Fed governors more welcoming of GOP lawmakers' efforts to revamp the central bank, which they say would make it more transparent and accountable to the public.\par \par \uc2 Legislative proposals under consideration include measures to subject the Fed to more congressional scrutiny, force it to adopt rules-based monetary policy-making, and limit its discretionary powers.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen has argued against these efforts, saying they would erode the Fed's independence and subject it to political interference that could ultimately harm the economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, however, could nominate a chair who would steer the Fed to voluntarily supply more of the information sought by Congress, such as more detail about its internal deliberations over interest rate policies.\par \par \uc2 The president could also reshape the Fed's monetary policy tilt with his appointments, but it is unclear whether he would prefer officials more inclined to raise interest rates aggressively\u8212\'20\'14"hawks" in Fed jargon. During the campaign he accused Ms. Yellen of holding rates low to help Mr. Obama, but also said in an interview, "I am a low interest-rate person."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14David Harrison contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Daniel Tarullo's resignation letter to President Donald Trump didn't give a reason for his departure.

(Feb. 10, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Cyberattacks on International Banks Show Links to Hackers Who Hit Sony\par \par \uc2 By Robert McMillan\par \par \uc2 Cybersecurity specialists have found evidence suggesting that recent attacks on institutions in Poland are part of an international hacking effort targeting financial institutions in the U.S., Mexico and the United Kingdom\u8212\'20\'14an attack that shares traits with the 2014 attack on \uc2 Sony Corp\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 The hacks began late last year, installing unauthorized code on websites belonging to financial regulators, then using those to attack computers belonging to a select list of global financial institutions, according to researchers who have examined the attacks at security vendors \uc2 Symantec Corp\uc2  . and \uc2 BAE Systems PLC\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 It is unclear to the researchers exactly how many banks were compromised or whether any suffered financial losses. But the researchers say it appears to be part of a well-organized and broad hacking effort that shares links to other attacks including the devastating 2014 hack that destroyed systems and exposed email messages at \uc2 Sony Pictures Entertainment\uc2  . U.S. officials have said North Korea was responsible for that attack. North Korea has denied that, though said its supporters might have done it.\par \par \uc2 Researchers at BAE Systems and Symantec say that some of the software and internet infrastructure in the global effort was also used in the \uc2 Sony\uc2  attack and\u8212\'20\'14more recently\u8212\'20\'14other attacks on banks in Asia. Security researchers call the North Korea-linked group they believe is behind these attacks "Lazarus." It has been active since 2009, according to Kaspersky Lab ZAO, a Russian cybersecurity company.\par \par \uc2 If the recent attacks are indeed by Lazarus, it suggests the group is broadening its banking attacks. The group's bank hacking previously had focused on Asia, said Eric Chien, technical director of Symantec's Security Technology and Response division. "We never saw them do anything, for example, to the U.S., let alone Europe," he said. "Now we see them targeting the U.S. and Europe."\par \par \uc2 In November the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  warned U.S. financial institutions that it was "monitoring emerging reports indicating that well-resourced and organized malicious cyber actors have intentions to target the U.S. financial sector."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  didn't respond to requests for comment about the latest attacks.\par \par \uc2 The attacks started in October by compromising the website of the \uc2 Polish Financial Supervision Authority\uc2  , an incident that was reported last week by the Badcyber.com blog. The hackers programmed that website to attack banking computers that visited the site, the researchers say.\par \par \uc2 Security investigators call this technique a "watering hole." It lets criminals use one common access point to break into a range of other organizations. In this case, by infecting a website commonly visited by banking employees, the hackers could hope to spread malicious software onto computers within the financial institutions on their list, said Adrian Nish, head of \uc2 BAE Systems\uc2  ' Threat Intelligence team.\par \par \uc2 A Polish Financial Supervision Authority spokesman confirmed that the regulator had "identified an external attempt to interfere in the operating IT system," and had turned over evidence of the incident to law enforcement after restoring the website. The Polish National Police Agency didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\par \par \uc2 The hackers programmed the hacked web servers to attack computers only if they originated from a short-list of approximately 75 institutions\u8212\'20\'14an apparent effort to keep a lower profile and help evade detection, the researchers say.\par \par \uc2 This list includes 19 financial institutions in Poland, 15 in the U.S., nine in Mexico, and seven in the U.K., said \uc2 BAE Systems\uc2  , which declined to name the institutions.\par \par \uc2 The attacks also compromised a website belonging to Mexico's financial regulator, the National Banking and Securities Commission, and a state-run bank in Uruguay, Dr. Nish said. A spokeswoman for the National Banking and Securities Commission said that it has seen no evidence that its computers were compromised. "During the past weekend, we received notice of a coordinated attack addressed to banking institutions world-wide," she said. "Our Security Operations Center performed a thorough inspection, from which no abnormal behavior was detected." The Commission's investigation is continuing she said.\par \par \uc2 The attacks, with their use of the "water hole" technique, appear to be more sophisticated than previous Lazarus attacks, Dr. Nish and Mr. Chien said. In the shadowy world of cybersecurity, code can be stolen and reused, which makes the business of linking attacks to specific actors time consuming and often inexact. Dr. Nish, at BAE, said he has a "high confidence" that the group involved is Lazarus. "We know the tools that they're using very well and we know the infrastructure they're using and their tactics," Dr. Nish said. "And we can strongly confirm that the tools that have been found on the bank networks and in these [website] attacks are part of the group's tool kit."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chien said that \uc2 Symantec\uc2  hadn't yet done analysis required to definitively make the connection, but that the tools used in these latest attacks are linked to Lazarus tools used in the past.\par \par \uc2 SEC Letter to Allergan Hints at Additional Non-GAAP Guidance\par \par \uc2 By Tatyana Shumsky\par \par \uc2 Details in a comment letter from the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  to \uc2 Allergan PLC\uc2  may offer insight to the future of the regulator's crackdown on company use of non-GAAP figures.\par \par \uc2 The agency chided the maker of Botox over the way it calculated "adjusted earnings per share," and took an unusual step saying it would review financial reporting practices in the pharmaceutical industry. The letter, dated Jan. 11, but made public last week, said the SEC would consider issuing additional guidance on tailored financial measures.\par \par \uc2 The calculation of adjusted earnings per share is a metric that doesn't conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; such figures are known as non-GAAP.\par \par \uc2 "We will evaluate the industry practices you described to us and consider whether additional comprehensive non-GAAP staff guidance is appropriate," the SEC said in the letter.\par \par \uc2 The comment is atypical in that it signaled the prospect of additional guidelines in a letter to a company, rather than a separate SEC statement, said Olga Usvyatsky, vice president of research at Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Comment letters are part of the SEC's nonauthoritative guidance, and not typically where the regulator announces new policy initiatives, she explained.\par \par \uc2 "The language itself suggests that they may consider additional guidance regardless of [the] administration," Ms. Usvyatsky said.\par \par \uc2 The SEC last year stepped up efforts to rein in the use of tailored accounting. The push, which included new guidelines on non-GAAP metrics and a wave of comment letters criticizing such practices, prompted many companies to change their presentation of results and cut back the use of adjusted figures.\par \par \uc2 The future of the SEC's clampdown is unclear amid the wider deregulatory efforts of President Donald Trump's administration. The correspondence with Allergan concluded nine days before Mr. Trump took office, and in the final days of former SEC Chairman Mary Jo White's tenure.\par \par \uc2 Ms. White stepped down on Jan. 20, handing the reins to acting SEC Chairman Michael Piwowar. Mr. Piwowar, a Republican, is already making swift changes at the agency, even before the president's nominee for SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, is confirmed.\par \par \uc2 The SEC declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 As for Allergan, the SEC concluded the company should consider dropping the metric from its reports or renaming it. Allergan excluded "more than half of all operating expenses" when calculating adjusted earnings per share, the SEC said. With so much excluded, the figure deviated too far from standard earnings per share and needed to be retitled.\par \par \uc2 Allergan renamed the metric to performance net income per share when it reported fourth-quarter and full year 2016 results on Feb. 8 "to better reflect the fact that it is simply a measure that management uses to evaluate its performance," said Mark Marmur, Allergan's director of corporate affairs, in an email.\par \par \uc2 Co-operative Bank\uc2  Puts Itself Up For Sale\par \par \uc2 By Margot Patrick\par \par \uc2 LONDON\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Co-operative Bank PLC\uc2  put itself up for sale Monday, a surprise move by the troubled bank co-owned by U.S. hedge funds and a British supermarket chain.\par \par \uc2 Chairman Dennis Holt said the move is aimed at putting the bank in a stronger capital position, after needing a waiver from the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  around its capital targets over the next few years. He blamed low interest rates and unforeseen expenses for the delay in the bank's return to health after a 2013 bailout by some of its bondholders.\par \par \uc2 Co-op Bank was saved by funds including \uc2 Silver Point Capital\uc2  and Perry Capital after bad loans, a costly technology upgrade and a failed acquisition wiped out a chunk of its capital that year.\par \par \uc2 Since then, it has cut costs by 20% and improved its systems, but struggled to rebuild capital. Co-op Bank continues to meet a baseline capital requirement for U.K. banks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Holt said the bank's shareholders are also "waking up to this announcement" and will be consulted on the proposed sale and other options, such as a possible capital injection from new and existing shareholders. No potential buyers have been lined up, he said.\par \par \uc2 Who can buy the bank could be restricted for competition reasons. The country's major incumbents have previously been barred from swallowing rivals. But external interest in U.K. banks is currently weak, with shares in many lenders trading at depressed levels below book value.\par \par \uc2 A further bail-in of Co-op Bank's bonds is also possible. "At the moment" it is in the bank's liquidity plan to repay a \u163\'00\'A3400 million ($499.4 million) senior bond maturing in September, Chief Executive Liam Coleman said.\par \par \uc2 Co-op Bank's biggest single shareholder, with around 20%, is former owner \uc2 Co-operative Group Ltd\uc2  ., a mutual that operates a chain of supermarkets.\par \par \uc2 Europe Vows to Maintain Postcrisis Financial Rules, Despite Trump Deregulation\par \par \uc2 By Julia-Ambra Verlaine\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Union\uc2  's financial services chief vowed to maintain the continent's postcrisis regulations, even as the U.S. now moves to dismantle many of its rules.\par \par \uc2 "We very much hope to continue working with all our partners internationally, but this is not only in our hands," Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president at the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  , the EU's executive arm, said in a speech in London Friday. "What is in the hands of the EU is to preserve recent reforms and firmly uphold our prudential framework.\par \par \uc2 In a separate appearance, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former head of the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  , said it "would be a total mistake" to embark on deregulation and expressed grave concern over stalled negotiations at the \uc2 Basel Committee\uc2  on Banking Standards, which is currently deciding on a final set of international capital requirements. Mr. Trichet, speaking at conference in Brussels on Thursday evening, warned that risks to the financial system remain high in light of increased public and private debt levels.\par \par \uc2 The men were speaking in the wake of pledges by new U.S. President Donald Trump to roll back the 2010 Dodd-Frank act, marking a sharp change in how the U.S. oversees its financial system and raising the prospect of creating gaps between the U.S. and Europe after years of attempts at close coordination.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's new policies\u8212\'20\'14along with the U.K.'s Brexit vote to leave the EU\u8212\'20\'14puts Mr. Dombrovsksis in a precarious situation where his two largest allies, the U.K. and the U.S. are turning inwards and seeking to boost national industries.\par \par \uc2 "It is difficult not to notice when the Chair of the Federal Reserve is criticized for her approach to negotiating international rules and standards," said Mr. Dombrovsksis, referencing a recent letter sent by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), vice-chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen. "Or when an American president talks about \u8216\'20\'18doing a big number' on Dodd Frank."\par \par \uc2 While the commission hasn't taken a formal stance on Brexit or on Mr. Trump's financial services policies\u8212\'20\'14which EU officials say are still vague \u8212\'20\'14Mr. Dombrovskis's speech reflects overall European concerns that the bloc may lose its prominence as a financial center if other jurisdictions begin to deregulate and put EU banks at a competitive disadvantage.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis says such "regulatory arbitrage"\u8212\'20\'14differences in rules from one country to another\u8212\'20\'14could put the global financial system at risk by incentivizing under-regulated activities for the sake of profit.\par \par \uc2 "Lax regulation in one country can create conditions for inadequate regulation and contagion throughout the world," he said. This is particularly alarming for some EU officials and international rulemakers who say financial stability shouldn't be taken for granted and that risks still loom on the horizon that could throw the EU and the world back into recession.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis also used his speech to cite examples of international cooperation between the U.S. and the EU: a recent agreement that allows clearinghouses on both sides of the Atlantic to operate under one set of rules and a deal struck last month smoothing the ability of insurance companies to operate in the two regions.\par \par \uc2 "Based on strong common international cooperation, the EU has been very open to recognize that our international partners' rules are equivalent and achieve the same objective as ours," said Mr. Dombrovskis.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis chose to open his speech with an evocative history lesson as he endeavors to preserve international coordination among financial regulators under threat from changing political tides.\par \par \uc2 "Five hundred years ago, a reformist movement started which would change the face of Europe: the Reformation," he said. "Five hundred years later, Europe faces a very different set of challenges to those pinned on a church door by Martin Luther. But there is a sense we too live in a period of disruptive change."\par \par \uc2 The year Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to a church door in Germany decrying the status quo is often referenced by historians as a pivotal point in European history that provoked substantial change in the Western world.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Mr. Dombrovskis's tenure has been marked by the disruptive political movements in the U.S. and the U.K. The former Latvian prime minister was thrown into his role as head of the EU's financial services portfolio in light of the U.K.'s vote to leave the union, which prompted his predecessor, Jonathan Hill, a U.K. citizen and commissioner at the time, to resign.\par \par \uc2 SEC Accuses Chinese Trader in Hollywood Insider-Trading Scheme\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 U.S. securities regulators on Friday accused a Chinese private-equity firm partner of engineering an insider-trading scheme that reaped $29 million through buying shares of \uc2 DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc\uc2  . before it was acquired by \uc2 Comcast Corp\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  said it obtained a court order freezing brokerage accounts used by Shaohua "Michael" Yin, a Chinese citizen and graduate of the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School\uc2  who works at Hong Kong-based Summitview Capital Management Ltd. The SEC also sued five other people, including Mr. Yin's parents, who it said owned those accounts and were unjustly enriched by the operation.\par \par \uc2 A press release issued by the SEC on Friday said there was no known defense counsel for Mr. Yin, who didn't immediately return an email seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 The SEC alleged that Mr. Yin obtained inside information about DreamWorks' sale and then used five accounts owned by relatives and associates to buy $56 million in DreamWorks' stock over several weeks in April 2016. The trading yielded profits of over $29 million, the SEC said. The purchases in Mr. Yin's parents' accounts at \uc2 Interactive Brokers LLC\uc2  used borrowed money to finance much of the positions.\par \par \uc2 "Despite the defendant's alleged attempts to hide his control over these accounts, the SEC's data analytic investigative tools enabled us to determine who was behind the suspicious trading," said Michele Wein Layne, director of the SEC's Los Angeles office.\par \par \uc2 Comcast\uc2  's purchase of DreamWorks for $3.8 billion came after it caught word that the entertainment studio was in negotiations with Hong Kong-based investment firm PAG Asia Capital. In a complaint made public Friday, the SEC said the suspicious trading began after PAG and DreamWorks exchanged a confidential term sheet outlining the deal on April 4, 2016.\par \par \uc2 PAG has $16 billion in funds under management, according to its website. Last year, it teamed up with Apex Technology to buy U.S. printer company \uc2 Lexmark International\uc2  for $2.5 billion. PAG didn't immediately return an email seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Comcast\uc2  later increased its offer price for DreamWorks. The price of DreamWorks' stock shot up 47% after news of the deal leaked and was eventually confirmed by the company on April 28.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's complaint doesn't allege how Mr. Yin acquired the information about the impending deal.

Now, he's vowing to hunt down "big capitalist crocodiles" to protect ordinary investors.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at an annual work meeting of the \uc2 China Securities Regulatory Commission\uc2  on Friday, chairman Liu Shiyu took aim at deep-pocketed investors who try to manipulate stocks. He said authorities will catch these "capitalist crocodiles" who "skin and suck blood" from retail investors, according to people who attended the Beijing meeting, which lays out priorities for the year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Liu's latest pledge highlights a prolonged effort by authorities to bring greater discipline to China's stock markets after a speculation-fueled boom ended in a stunning crash in mid-2015. The cleanup effort has included arrests for insider trading and market manipulation, as well as jawboning by the usually low-key Mr. Liu. In December he likened insurers to barbaric corporate raiders for using premium income to amass stakes in listed companies.\par \par \uc2 At a weekly media briefing, a spokesman said the commission aims to tackle illegal activities and risks at regional exchanges nationwide within the next six months, according to a statement posted on its website.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Liu didn't specify who the "crocodiles" are. Commission officials declined to elaborate. Last month a renowned Chinese fund manager, Xu Xiang, was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison for stock manipulation. A week later, billionaire Xiao Jianhua, founder of Tomorrow Holding, disappeared after being taken by Chinese authorities from his Four Seasons apartment in Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 The disappearance of the politically-connected Mr. Xiao has sowed trepidation in some corners of Hong Kong, a capitalist enclave long used by members of the Chinese business elite as a safe harbor when political waters turned rough back home. It has also rattled Chinese finance circles.\par \par \uc2 Tomorrow Holding, a sprawling empire of investments from insurance to beet farming, hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment, including on Friday. A statement posted last week at one of its offices in Beijing said the company was operating normally and hasn't received notice of any investigation involving Mr. Xiao.\par \par \uc2 "The CSRC has been public about cleaning up the market, especially insider trading of small-cap stocks," said David Millhouse, head of China research at Hong Kong-based brokerage Forsyth Barr Asia. "If any person has been involved in this, it wouldn't be a surprise if the authorities are trying to prosecute them."\par \par \uc2 Stocks associated with Tomorrow Holding fell on Friday, despite a broad rally on the Shanghai market. \uc2 Baotou Tomorrow Technology Co\uc2  . slumped by 5%, while Baotou Huazi Industry Co. and \uc2 Xishui Strong Year Co. Ltd Inner Mongolia\uc2  fell by 1.3% and 0.4%, respectively.\par \par \uc2 Traders and analysts said the decline in those stocks was spurred by Mr. Liu's remarks.

Morgan\uc2  Won, Then Lost, Indonesia's Business\par \par \uc2 By Ben Otto, Rachel Rosenthal and I Made Sentana\par \par \uc2 On the Sunday after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, sparking turmoil in emerging markets, \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2  . downgraded Indonesia's stock market. The move set off a chain reaction that resulted in the New York bank losing Indonesia as a client.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  tried to smooth relations with Indonesia, as it had done several times in the past. At stake for the bank was a lucrative and decades-long partnership. Bank executives spoke with officials through back channels, pushed for meetings and pointed to subsequent reports with more-positive views on Indonesia's economy, said several people familiar with the efforts.\par \par \uc2 Analysts turned over to the finance ministry past market-research reports, and higher-level managers began to sign off on Indonesia research, according to one of the people. In January, the bank's analysts partly reversed their Indonesia equities call, bumping their recommendation up to "neutral" from "underweight."\par \par \uc2 But Indonesian officials were unmoved. They insisted that banks like \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  , which were primary dealers for government-bond sales, have a responsibility to support the interests of the Southeast Asian nation. They were open to criticism, the officials said, but they felt \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's report wasn't accurate or credible. \uc2 Indonesia's finance ministry\uc2  declined to comment for this article.\par \par \uc2 Investments banks have long weathered complaints that their research departments, which make calls on stocks, bonds and other assets, aren't truly independent from their investment-banking operations, which pitch deals to companies and governments.\par \par \uc2 But in Indonesia, and other parts of Asia, government officials' expectations for positive research are unabashed and unapologetic. That means global banks walk a fine line when publishing research their investment-banking clients don't like.\par \par \uc2 In Asia, some bankers say they are routinely quizzed about their research teams' reports when bidding for government business. In Indonesia, central-bank employees roam trading rooms, urging traders to be patriotic by refraining from selling the rupiah when the currency is under pressure, traders say.\par \par \uc2 A Bank Indonesia spokesman confirmed the bank sends officials to trading rooms during times of heavy selling pressure on the rupiah. He said he doesn't know what they say to dealers.\par \par \uc2 Rarely is the push to be positive as pronounced\u8212\'20\'14and public\u8212\'20\'14as it was with Indonesia's reaction to \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's November report. Nor are the consequences typically as severe.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  lost its Indonesian primary-dealer and underwriting business for government bonds, as well as its ability to receive payments made under the country's tax-amnesty program.\par \par \uc2 The dealer role gave \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  important visibility into the much larger business of matching buyers and sellers of Indonesian government debt and currency, which brings in an estimated tens of millions of dollars in revenue for \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  each year, analysts say. The bank can still trade government bonds and the rupiah, as well as continue to underwrite stock and debt for private companies.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  says that its Indonesia business is operating as usual, that impact on clients from the government ban is minimal and that it is working with the finance ministry to resolve the matter.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's first big run-in with Indonesia came after the collapse of \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  in 2008, when lawmakers there blamed a bank recommendation to sell rupiah-denominated government bonds for accelerating a flow of money out of the country. Officials under Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a well-regarded, U.S.-trained economist who was almost three years into her first stint in the job, were primarily worried about controlling market reaction to the report, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Shortly thereafter, \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  presented the ministry with a plan on how the bank would handle negative press and control the release of future reports, the person said, and flew in its Asia Pacific chief to meet with Indonesia's vice president.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mulyani didn't publicly penalize \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  . The bank's analysts toned down the language in Indonesian bond reports, changing "sell" calls to recommendations to reduce portfolio weighting, a person familiar with the research said.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, during the market tumult that followed a Chinese move to effectively devalue the yuan, the bank again lowered its investment recommendation on rupiah government bonds. A new finance minister, Bambang Brodjonegoro, called the move "unethical" and threatened sanctions, including, he joked, 100 push-ups.\par \par \uc2 Haryanto Budiman, a 48-year-old veteran of \uc2 McKinsey & Co\uc2  . and Indonesia's largest state bank who had become \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's local chief four years before, led a blitzkrieg response, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Budiman and colleagues met and texted with longtime friends and former colleagues at \uc2 Bank Indonesia\uc2  , the finance ministry and the financial-sector regulator. Mr. Brodjonegoro was eventually appeased, and recalls telling Mr. Budiman to be careful about research.\par \par \uc2 By the time Mr. Trump's election roiled emerging markets, Ms. Mulyani was back as finance minister, charged with building credibility for Indonesia's financial system. On the Friday after the election, the rupiah dropped as much as 2.7%, the Indonesian stock market fell 4% and \uc2 Bank Indonesia\uc2  poured an estimated $1 billion into rupiah purchases and bond buybacks. Behind the selloff were investor worries that emerging-market economies would suffer from Mr. Trump's protectionist trade policies, a strengthening U.S. dollar and outflows due to rising U.S. interest rates.\par \par \uc2 On the Monday after \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's equities downgrade, a media story on the report began circulating "like a virus" on WhatsApp, one Indonesian banking executive said. The stock market slid another 2%. Ms. Mulyani, who had flown to Africa to attend a climate-change conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, canceled meetings and returned to Asia, people with knowledge of the matter said.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday morning, Ms. Mulyani's officials called one of the report's co-authors to quiz him about the downgrade, according to people familiar with the call. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's Mr. Budiman was out of the country and tried to soothe tempers from abroad, one of the people said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mulyani declined to comment for this article.\par \par \uc2 Before the week was out, with the stock market, rupiah and bonds all down steeply, Ms. Mulyani wrote to Mr. Budiman. In the letter, she said Indonesia was cutting ties with the bank, according to people familiar with the letter.\par \par \uc2 Western diplomats met Indonesian finance ministry representatives to explain the division between research and investment banking and were told: "Yes, but they are the same. They are \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  ," according to a person briefed on the conversation.\par \par \uc2 On Jan. 12, Ms. Mulyani hosted a meeting with analysts and economists. At the meeting, she cautioned them to be careful with their research reports, according to several attendees.\par \par \uc2 Since the meeting was only for primary dealers, \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  wasn't invited.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Analyst: Tarullo's Exit is Good News for Bank Stocks\par \par \uc2 Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo's impending resignation, announced on Friday, is good news for bank stocks, writes analyst Brian Gardner of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

The last thing we want to do is to go back to what it was pre-2008," Richard Hunt, president and chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in an interview this week. "We believe in consumer protection. It has to be there."\par \par \uc2 The CBA, along with three trade groups representing credit unions and community banks, have made a joint request to the Senate to overhaul the CFPB by turning its single-director structure into a five-member bipartisan commission. The goal is to reduce their compliance burden and slow the pace of new regulations coming from the bureau.\par \par \uc2 But departing from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/understanding-the-financial-choice-act/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 previous iterations of his plan  }}}\uc2 , Mr. Hensarling's latest agenda doesn't include the introduction of a commission and instead calls for keeping the single-director structure, albeit with less independence for the director.\par \par \uc2 And surprising experts, it lists steps that offer an edge to nonbank lenders over traditional banks\u8212\'20\'14a plan banks are sure to have issues with. Under the proposed repeal of the CFPB's supervisory authority, nonbanks in mortgage and auto financing and payday lending would largely escape regulatory scrutiny. Banks with assets of more than $10 billion would also be freed of CFPB supervision but would continue to be tightly monitored by banking regulators such as the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  and the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 "This is not a win for traditional banks," said Rohit Chopra, a former student-loan ombudsman at the CFPB.\par \par \uc2 It is unlikely the CFPB will be annihilated according to Mr. Hensarling's plan, and it's not just because of resistance from banks. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about what it wants to do with the agency. White House spokesman \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2  has called the CFPB unconstitutional, while \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , chief economic adviser to Mr. Trump and a former Goldman Sachs president, has suggested his focus was on a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-looks-to-restructure-cfpb-1486116000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 change in personnel  }}}\uc2 , a step that would lead to Mr. Cordray's firing. Senate lawmakers, meanwhile, would likely seek less drastic measures than those unveiled by Mr. Hensarling, experts say.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Hensarling Drops Bid to Turn CFPB Into a Bipartisan Commission\par \par \uc2 By Rachel Witkowski\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14House Financial Services Committee Chairman \uc2 Jeb Hensarling\uc2  (R., Texas) is no longer seeking to turn the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  into a bipartisan commission, abandoning a long-sought goal for diffusing the bureau's single-director structure, according to a memo to committee leaders said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hensarling is expected to soon unveil a new version of legislation to significantly unwind key parts of financial laws enacted by the Obama administration, including limiting the power of the CFPB. A Feb. 6 memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal outlines changes Mr. Hensarling expects to make from a version he introduced in the prior Congress.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hensarling, among other things, intends to reduce the CFPB's authority, ease capital requirements for banks that are performing well and place limits on the stress testing of firms' ability to withstand shocks to the financial system. He also would trim other regulations the financial industry has said are overly burdensome.\par \par \uc2 People familiar with the matter said Republicans are now in favor of a single-director structure because eventually President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  could fill the position with someone who pursues a more business-friendly agenda.\par \par \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2  , appointed during the Obama administration, is currently the director in a term that runs through July 2018. Critics of the CFPB have pressed the Trump administration to remove him from the job before his term is up.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hensarling in a Wednesday op-ed in The Wall Street Journal called for Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Cordray by "citing the president's constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws are faithfully executed."\par \par \uc2 "A new director could first undo all harmful actions taken by the CFPB during the Obama era," Mr. Hensarling wrote. "He could then implement policies that actually benefit consumers, such as limits on class-action lawsuits wherein plaintiff law firms get fortunes but injured financial consumers get pennies."\par \par \uc2 The memo also calls for significant curtailing of the CFPB's rule-making powers to be more like a "civil law enforcement agency" similar to the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  "with additional restrictions on its authority." It would have a "sole director, removable by the president at-will." The proposal also would repeal the CFPB's consumer complaint database and eliminate its research and consumer education functions, among other changes.\par \par \uc2 Other significant proposals being considered would reduce regulatory oversight of smaller banks, according to the memo.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hensarling's proposal faces opposition from Democrats who argue deregulating the financial system will harm consumers rather than help them.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the Financial Services panel in a written statement said, "This bill makes it crystal clear that Republicans mean to disarm our consumer protections, expose the American public to financial predators."\par \par \uc2 The ideas presented in the memo wouldn't wipe out the bureau completely but would leave it with much-reduced authority.\par \par \uc2 One significant change would be the repeal of its supervisory authority, which covers a vast swath of consumer financial markets from nonbank companies in mortgage and auto lending, student loan servicing, payday lending, debt collection, as well as banks and credit unions with assets over $10 billion. Resistance to the CFPB has been particularly strong from nonbank companies that had escaped regulatory scrutiny before the bureau was created,\par \par \uc2 It also includes steps that would prevent the CFPB from introducing new rules covering certain industries such as payday lenders, an industry that has fiercely opposed the bureau's new rules.\par \par \uc2 "This is obviously a huge windfall for payday lenders," said Rohit Chopra, a former student loan ombudsman at the CFPB and a senior Education Department official.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Yuka Hayashi contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Pawlenty: Congress Unlikely to Make Big Changes to Financial Policy\par \par \uc2 By Gabriel T. Rubin\par \par \uc2 Congress is unlikely to make major changes affecting the financial-services industry despite Republican control of both chambers as well as the White House, said Tim Pawlenty , a financial lobbyist and former GOP governor of Minnesota.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lot of remaining uncertainty about where the priorities will land and what could actually get done," Mr. Pawlenty, chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 He had higher hopes that Democratic senators, particularly those representing states President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  won in November, might cooperate with Republicans on a tax-code overhaul or changes to the Affordable Care Act, but was skeptical that they would go along with Republican plans to make significant changes to the financial-regulatory regime.\par \par \uc2 "You'd be hard pressed to say candidly that Democrats are going to cooperate substantially on financial-service reform," he said. "Absent a legal deadline or a crisis, it's \u8216\'20\'18Katy, bar the door.' "\par \par \uc2 Without the cooperation of at least eight Democratic senators, Republicans would have trouble passing significant financial-services legislation. Most bills in the Senate must receive at least 60 votes to overcome the threat of a filibuster, and Republicans hold a slim majority of 52 seats. That makes more ambitious legislation, like the Financial Choice Act from House Financial Services Committee Chairman \uc2 Jeb Hensarling\uc2  (R., Texas), unlikely to find success in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 For that reason, Mr. Pawlenty and \uc2 Financial Services Roundtable\uc2  members\u8212\'20\'14which include many of the largest banks, investment firms and insurance companies\u8212\'20\'14are focusing intently on the appointments of senior regulators and administration officials who may have more of an impact on financial policy than Congress.\par \par \uc2 The key appointments include many of the second- and third-tier political appointees within agencies like the Treasury and Labor departments, as well as more prominent posts like the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Trump has nominated attorney \uc2 Jay Clayton\uc2  for that job, though he has yet to be confirmed. But perhaps most important among them is the Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision, a position that has been vacant since its creation under the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law. The role has been filled unofficially by Daniel Tarullo, the Fed's point person for regulatory matters.\par \par \uc2 Another post Mr. Pawlenty identified was the head of the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  , which is already the subject of significant political maneuvering in Washington. Several top Republicans, including Mr. Hensarling, have called on Mr. Trump to fire Director \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2  immediately and replace him with a director more in tune with Republican concerns about the agency.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hensarling removed language from the Choice Act that would have shifted the agency to a commission structure, according to a memo circulated among top Financial Services Committee Republicans that was reviewed by the Journal on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 That represents an about-face from the longstanding Republican position that the CFPB's structure should be changed to a five-person bipartisan commission, along the lines of the \uc2 SEC\uc2  or \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pawlenty said Republicans have leverage to persuade Democrats to support making the CFPB a commission.\par \par \uc2 "With Director Cordray's time being closer to the end than the beginning, [Democrats] may have to rethink their views on the commission structure," he said. "If they have a Trump person in there for six years, does that change their view on a commission?"\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pawlenty added, "There are 10 permutations to how this could go, but there's enough interesting political dynamics that you might be able to draw people in from both parties to get this done."\par \par \uc2 A CFPB spokeswoman has said Mr. Cordray had no plans to step down; his term runs through July 2018. In an interview at a WSJ Pro Financial Regulation event in late January, Mr. Cordray declined to say what he might do if Mr. Trump tried to fire him.\par \par \uc2 How the Fiduciary-Rule Review Is Likely to Play Out\par \par \uc2 By Lisa Beilfuss\par \par \uc2 New retirement-savings rules set to take effect in two months are under threat after President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's order to review the regulation with an eye toward repealing or rescinding it, leaving the financial-advice industry guessing about next steps.\par \par \uc2 The fiduciary rule, due to take effect April 10, is meant to ensure that advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings put clients' interests ahead of their own. It is unpopular with Republicans and some in the financial industry who say it would harm consumers more than help by limiting investment options, elevating costs and potentially cutting off low-balance customers from some forms of professional advice.\par \par \uc2 Some of the rule's backers say the work firms have done to become compliant and heightened consumer awareness mean it is too late to squash the spirit of the rule.\par \par \uc2 "The industry will ride to the rescue of the rule," said Paul Smith, chief executive of investment-professional group CFA Institute, adding that a decision to postpone the rule and then revamp or rescind it "may not be as popular a move as the administration thinks."\par \par \uc2 Here are some possible scenarios for how the review could play out.\par \par \uc2 Delay\par \par \uc2 Many experts say a delay in the regulation's April 10 implementation deadline is likely as the Labor Department conducts its review. A draft of last week's memo from the White House said the fiduciary rule's implementation date would be put off by six months, but the final memo didn't include specifics and left the call on a delay up to the department.\par \par \uc2 It's unlikely April 10 comes and goes without the Labor Department pushing out the applicability date, says Andrew Oringer, a partner at \uc2 Dechert LLP\uc2  and head of the firm's fiduciary practice. If the applicability date were to kick in, he said, "the path [to revising or revoking the rule] becomes cloudier."\par \par \uc2 Revision\par \par \uc2 The Labor Department could reopen the comment period on the fiduciary rule to reassess the industry's concerns, experts say, and could then under a new secretary rework the rule in a way that makes compliance less onerous. Mr. Trump's pick to lead the department, \uc2 Andrew Puzder\uc2 , is set for a confirmation hearing next week after a number of delays.\par \par \uc2 A revised rule could potentially relax the requirements of an exemption that allows brokers and other financial advisers to continue business as usual if their clients sign a contract freeing them from strict fiduciary care. It also could potentially drop the private right of action\u8212\'20\'14which allows for class-action suits\u8212\'20\'14and instead require clients to take their adviser to arbitration in the event of disputes over conduct and investments.\par \par \uc2 A revised rule along these lines "could take out a lot of the bite, but there would likely still be a means to enforce the rule," said Lisa Herrnson, a managing director at consultancy PwC.\par \par \uc2 The rule's review also could result in a carve-out of certain sales. Erin Sweeney, an attorney at Miller & Chevalier Chartered who represents parties in litigation regarding fiduciary obligations, said the analysis used to craft the rule as it now stands focused on mutual funds, underpinning complaints by the annuities industry that it is unfairly treated by the rule and that the threat would impinge upon sellers' business.\par \par \uc2 Restrictions on annuities have been at the heart of the rule as agents tend to earn commissions and other sales incentives. Chip Anderson, executive director for the National Association for Fixed Annuities, a trade association, said more than 50% of the annuities industry would be "severely affected," with potentially half of the industry's jobs at stake.\par \par \uc2 Repeal\par \par \uc2 Many experts say a repeal without replacement is an unlikely scenario, in part because the fiduciary rule is already a regulation, albeit one that isn't yet being enforced. That reality makes it difficult for the administration to quash the rule without putting forth an alternative rule.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think we're going back to where we started," said Ms. Sweeney.\par \par \uc2 In the final days of Barack Obama's presidency, the Labor Department issued a set of frequently asked questions targeting consumers that could help entrench the concept in the public's mind. The market was already trending toward a higher standard of care, Mr. Oringer said, and some firms "will point to it as a marketing opportunity."\par \par \uc2 A trifecta of court decisions upholding the fiduciary rule also makes it tougher for the new administration to altogether kill the rule, Ms. Sweeney said. A Texas judge this week handed the latest victory to the Labor Department, rejecting a challenge led by the Chamber of Commerce seeking to sink the regulation. The decision follows similar opinions in Washington, D.C. and Kansas. The court opinions upholding the rule, Ms. Sweeney said, "creates a stumbling block for the Trump administration" as it goes "back to the drawing board."\par \par \uc2 Congress or \uc2 SEC\uc2  Action\par \par \uc2 Arjun Saxena, a principal at PwC who works with financial-services clients, said the legislative route remains a viable one particularly if the implementation date is delayed as it would give Congress time to come up with a replacement.\par \par \uc2 Late last year, after Mr. Trump's presidential victory, Rep. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.), a member of the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  , said he could conceive of a "pared-down rule that at least limits the size of commissions." Such pay, which brokers and annuities sellers generate by selling investment products, can usher in conflicts of interest and is at the heart of the fiduciary rule.\par \par \uc2 Some experts say a delay would give the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  an opportunity to produce a uniform standard that covers all savings, not just retirement savings.\par \par \uc2 Others, though, say it would take at least a couple of years for the \uc2 SEC\uc2  to craft such a rule and give the industry time to comply. "We'd be comfortably into 2019," Mr. Smith said.\par \par \uc2 Whichever the scenario, Mr. Oringer said, a revamped rule would be "principles-based" and less stringent than the current regulation.\par \par \uc2 Banks Sue U.S. Government Over Fed Dividend Cut\par \par \uc2 By David Harrison\par \par \uc2 A major trade group for the banking industry sued the government Thursday over cuts to the money banks receive from the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  enacted as part of a highway and mass-transit funding measure in 2015.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2  , joined by Seattle-based Washington Federal, says the law violates the contract between banks and the Fed by reducing dividends paid to member banks and looks to reimburse banks for their lost payments.\par \par \uc2 The 1913 law creating the Fed required that banks purchase stock in regional Fed banks as a way to fund the central bank and protect it from unexpected losses. In exchange, banks would receive a 6% annual dividend payment.\par \par \uc2 The transportation bill targeted those payments to help cover its $305 billion price tag. Banks with greater than $10 billion in assets would see their dividends set at 6% or at the yield of the 10-year Treasury note during the most recent auction before the dividend, whichever was smaller. Yields on Treasurys have been below 2.5% for much of the past year, which would represent a significant dividend cut.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  estimates the dividend cut would raise almost $7 billion in new government funding over 10 years.\par \par \uc2 "The change to the statutory dividend rate upended \uc2 Federal Reserve System\uc2  policy that has been in place for more than 100 years," said ABA President Rob Nichols. "This action undercuts the work banks do every day to help drive economic growth and meet the needs of America's businesses and communities. It is particularly damaging for affected community banks, which have had a much more difficult time replacing the lost income."\par \par \uc2 The ABA lobbied against the dividend cut during congressional deliberations over the bill.\par \par \uc2 The legislation also tapped into a Fed surplus account by capping it at $10 billion. That move brought in another $53.3 billion over 10 years dedicated to the bill.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Pence Hires Cato's Calabria as Chief Economist\par \par \uc2 By Andrew Ackerman\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Vice President Mike Pence has hired a former Republican Senate aide and prolific critic of the mortgage-finance system as his chief economist, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mark Calabria, who formerly ran financial-regulation studies at the libertarian \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  , began working on Mr. Pence's staff Wednesday, a person familiar with the move said. Mr. Calabria's portfolio would include a range of issues besides mortgage finance such as tax and trade matter, the person said.\par \par \uc2 From his perch in Mr. Pence's office, Mr. Calabria could play a key role in shaping deregulatory legislation as it works its way through Congress. One of Mr. Pence's roles in the Trump administration is to serve as a liaison with Congress.\par \par \uc2 A former aide to ex-Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) and Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), Mr. Calabria has pushed to end government support of mortgage giants \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  , urged Congress to repeal the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overall and called for curbs to the federal mortgage interest deduction.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Calabria backs a plan to replace Dodd-Frank authored by House Financial Services Committee Chairman \uc2 Jeb Hensarling\uc2  (R., Tex.) known as the Financial Choice Act. That plan, Mr. Calabria has said, would raise capital requirements for banks while reducing compliance costs and what he described as over-reliance on regulatory discretion.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hensarling's legislation, which cleared the House last year and is expected to again advance through the chamber in the coming weeks, moves the financial system "in the direction of more stability and fewer bailouts," Mr. Calabria wrote this fall.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: GOP Senator Criticizes Fed's Stress Tests\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 Sen. Pat Toomey\uc2  wrote to Federal Reserve Chairwoman \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  Thursday criticizing the regulator's annual "stress tests."\par \par \uc2 The Pennsylvania Republican in his letter urged the Fed "to consider holding off on rules that would add to the existing regulatory framework" until the Trump administration reviews existing rules and the Senate confirms Mr. Trump's yet-to-be-named nominees to the Fed's governing board.\par \par \uc2 The letter comes as the Fed is working on a proposal that would make the stress tests harder for the very largest U.S. banks by adding a capital "surcharge" to the exams.\par \par \uc2 The Fed couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 BOE's Charlotte Hogg Named Deputy Governor for Banking and Markets\par \par \uc2 By Jason Douglas\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hogg will be one of the most powerful officials at the central bank, with a seat on both the interest-rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee and its Financial Policy Committee, which safeguards the stability of the U.K. financial system.\par \par \uc2 Her new role also combines her chief operating officer duties with those of the deputy governor, the BOE said, putting her in charge of the daily running of the institution as well as swaths of the bank's operations in financial markets. Both the COO job and deputy governor for markets and banking are relatively new posts, created in an overhaul of BOE governance implemented by \uc2 Gov. Mark Carney\uc2  soon after he joined in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hogg joins the BOE's policy committees at a challenging time. The U.K. vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  in June has clouded the economic outlook and raised questions over the future of London's huge financial sector. The BOE cut its benchmark rate to a new low in August as part of a multipronged stimulus package to shore up the economy. But officials' easy-money stance is being tested by quickening inflation.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hogg's views on interest-rate and financial-stability policy are unclear. Though she worked at the BOE early in her career, she has spent most of her working life elsewhere in finance, with stints in senior roles at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and the U.K. unit of Spain's \uc2 Banco Santander SA\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 "She's a bit of an unknown quantity," said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank in London, referring to where she stands on policy. But he added it isn't unusual for the Treasury to draw on candidates with experience beyond academia and policy to fill such senior roles.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond praised Ms. Hogg's leadership skills and experience, saying she steps into her new role at a critical time.\par \par \uc2 Separately, the BOE said \uc2 Kristin Forbes\uc2 , one of the four members of the nine-member MPC drawn from outside the BOE's ranks, won't seek a second term in office after her initial three-year spell expires June 30. Ms. Forbes, a U.S. academic who advised President \uc2 George W. Bush\uc2  on economic policy, plans to return full time to the \uc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\uc2  , where she is a professor of management and global economics.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Forbes is among the more hawkish members of the rate-setting panel, saying in a speech Tuesday that she may soon vote for higher borrowing costs to contain inflation. Her departure could "modestly dilute" the chance of an early interest-rate rise if the economy proves resilient this year, said \uc2 Howard Archer\uc2 , economist at IHS Global Insight in London.\par \par \uc2 Sinking Feeling: Shipping Is Latest European Banking Worry\par \par \uc2 By William Wilkes in Hamburg and Max Colchester in London\par \par \uc2 The global shipping crisis is stoking another European banking headache, this time in economic powerhouse Germany.\par \par \uc2 Commerzbank AG\uc2  on Thursday warned that its losses on shipping loans could be as high as \u8364\'20\'AC600 million ($641 million) this year after nearly doubling last year to \u8364\'20\'AC559 million. Last week, \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2  , Germany's largest bank, said its expected losses from shipping loans nearly tripled, to \u8364\'20\'AC346 million, from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 In Germany's port of Hamburg\u8212\'20\'14one of Europe's richest cities\u8212\'20\'14state-owned \uc2 HSH Nordbank\uc2  is racing to find a buyer or face liquidation after suffering massive losses on shipping-related debt.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say the continued wave of write-downs indicates German banks remain hesitant to take the painful measures needed to restructure their businesses, almost a decade after the global economic crisis.\par \par \uc2 Before the crisis, German lenders became the world's biggest issuers of shipping loans. As of last year they owned roughly $90 billion worth, or almost one-fourth of all outstanding shipping loans made by large banks, according to Petrofin Global Bank Research. German banks and investors own more of the world's containership capacity than any other country\u8212\'20\'14roughly 29%, according to the German Shipowners' Association.\par \par \uc2 Plunging world shipping rates and the bankruptcy of South Korea's Hanjin Shipping last year helped create a bloodbath for the sector, which had previously seemed a safe bet for export-oriented Germany. Banks world-wide now are racing to dump bad shipping loans while shippers scramble to unload worthless ships.\par \par \uc2 "The market is deteriorating and everybody is trying to exit," said Basil Karatzas, founder of Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co. in New York.\par \par \uc2 Shipping losses are especially hard on German banks, which are trying to recover from the euro crisis, record-low interest rates and, at \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  , scandals. Rather than aggressively write down shipping loans early, German banks let them linger and eat into profits. The eurozone's banking watchdog has said it is increasing on-site inspections at several German banks to resolve shipping-loan problems. Banks are lobbying global regulators to relax rules on how much capital must be held against these loans.\par \par \uc2 No bank epitomizes the problem more clearly than \uc2 HSH Nordbank\uc2  , whose lending spree left it owning a commercial fleet larger than the British, French and German military navies combined. \uc2 European Union\uc2  authorities have ordered the bank to be privatized by early next year or shut. Taxpayers in northern Germany face losses of up to \u8364\'20\'AC15 billion, or over \u8364\'20\'AC3,000 a person.\par \par \uc2 "It's a catastrophe," said Rainer Kerstin, the head of the taxpayer's association in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which with Hamburg owns HSH.\par \par \uc2 During the boom years, HSH bankers would mingle with local politicians and shipping magnates in a vast beer hall under Hamburg city hall. Several of those same politicians and businessmen sat on HSH's supervisory board and encouraged it to become the world's biggest shipping lender.\par \par \uc2 After the shipping collapse, HSH's owners rescued it by pumping in billions of taxpayer euros and pledging to reimburse HSH for \u8364\'20\'AC10 billion of losses on dud loans. EU authorities deemed that illegal state aid. HSH's government owners were ordered to sell their 85% stake by next February.\par \par \uc2 The bank is racing to make itself attractive. It created a "bad bank" that last year took ownership of 253 container ships. HSH's management has conducted roadshows in London marketed to potential Asian investors.\par \par \uc2 Indicative bids for the bank are expected later in February. Any deal requires EU approval, adding another hurdle.\par \par \uc2 In Hamburg, the fallout is spreading. Hamburg businessman Bernd Kort\u252\'00\'FCm sat on HSH's advisory board from 2004 to June 2015, a period in which the bank extended billions of euros in credit to his shipping firm. Late last year, his company received some \u8364\'20\'AC500 million in debt relief from HSH. Around that time Mr. Kort\u252\'00\'FCm purchased a 130-foot racing yacht.\par \par \uc2 Local politicians were outraged. "I'm totally disgusted by it," said Wolfgang Kubicki, member of Schleswig-Holstein's state parliament for the pro-business FDP party. "We have to build schools, fund police, fix streets, but this millionaire gets debts written off.

That is roughly double the size of the loan book at \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2  ., the U.S.'s biggest lender. This entrusted lending, so named because banks serve as middlemen, is now the fastest-growing major component of the country's elaborate system of informal, or shadow, banking.\par \par \uc2 The most recent surge came during the selloff in China's $9.3 trillion bond market late last year. Big, cash-rich companies\u8212\'20\'14mostly state-owned enterprises and some private companies\u8212\'20\'14stepped in: New entrusted loans rose to 405.7 billion yuan ($59.02 billion) in December, more than double the month prior, according to data tracker Wind Information, and the highest monthly issuance in two years.\par \par \uc2 But the practice poses broader risks for China's economy.\par \par \uc2 Instead of investing in their core business, companies can earn interest rates of up to 20% making entrusted loans, often with only cursory checks on borrowers' creditworthiness. Such lending often props up companies in sectors like mining and property where Beijing wants to reduce excess capacity. It also adds to China's $18 trillion corporate debt pile, already equal to 168% of gross domestic product, according to the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Some entrusted loans are between a company and its own subsidiaries, similar to how many big companies globally loan cash to different parts of their businesses. Still, between 2007 and 2013 more than 60% of entrusted loans were channeled to companies in industries with overcapacity, according to a study by the U.S.-based \uc2 National Bureau of Economic Research\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 "It's not a sustainable business model" for the lending companies, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. "Their main operations are only staying afloat by acting like a shadow bank."\par \par \uc2 Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd\uc2  ., or Chalco, is one major company where lending has become a big business. With its main smelting operations struggling due to a glut of aluminum, the company has ramped up its lending to boost profits. Chalco, a publicly traded unit of state-owned \uc2 Chinalco\uc2  , took in 30.7 million yuan in interest income from entrusted loans in the first six months of 2016\u8212\'20\'14more than four times as much as a year earlier and nearly 50% of its net profit. In a texted response to a request for comment, Chalco said the increase in entrusted lending was part of an effort to centralize capital management and employ assets flexibly while lowering funding costs.\par \par \uc2 Company-to-company lending took off in China in the 1990s when, after a period of rapid growth, many state-owned firms started generating large amounts of cash. With no private shareholders pushing for dividend payouts, many put that cash to work by lending it out.\par \par \uc2 Big corporations in other countries have in the past built large financing arms. \uc2 GE Capital\uc2  , a unit of \uc2 General Electric\uc2  , at one point became a top lender in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 But entrusted lending is unusual. Banks are involved, but only as a middleman: Direct company-to-company lending is still legally prohibited. Banks can charge fees of up to 5% of the loan, according to BMI Research, but leave credit checks to the lending company.\par \par \uc2 "When a bank lends, they have to do their homework, they have experienced credit analysts," said Warut Promboon, chief ratings officer at Chinese firm Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. Mr. Promboon added that in his experience, few Chinese companies have the personnel to adequately assess credit risks.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, lending companies aren't pulling back even when loans sour.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18When a bank lends, they have to do their homework, they have experienced credit analysts.'\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Warut Promboon, Dagong Global Credit Rating\par \par \uc2 In June, \uc2 Datang International Power Generation Co\uc2  ., a state-owned energy company, said it would write off $8 billion of its $10 billion portfolio of entrusted loans made a year earlier to small coal companies in which it owned stakes.\par \par \uc2 "If our subsidiaries suffer more, it will make it more difficult for them to get bank loans," said a Datang International representative. "In this case, we may issue more entrusted loans."\par \par \uc2 Entrusted lending can provide a last-ditch option for companies blacklisted from other funding avenues. Chinese banks aren't allowed to extend normal loans to companies in default.\par \par \uc2 In December, \uc2 China Cinda Asset Management Co\uc2  . agreed to provide \uc2 Shandong Shanshui Cement Group Ltd\uc2  . an entrusted loan of up to 8 billion yuan ($1.16 billion). The loan's terms weren't disclosed; Shanshui declined to comment. China Cinda couldn't be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 Shanshui, one of China's biggest cement makers, had defaulted on nearly 12 billion yuan ($1.75 billion) of its debt as of June 2016, according to disclosures. A slump in China's cement industry drove defaults and bondholder lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 Companies sometimes charge sky-high rates for loans to risky industries. \uc2 Zhejiang Longsheng Group Co\uc2  ., a privately owned chemicals producer whose customers include \uc2 Nike Inc\uc2  . and \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2  ., according to its website, is charging 17% interest\u8212\'20\'14four times China's one-year benchmark lending rate\u8212\'20\'14for a one-year, 250 million yuan loan to Zhejiang Time Square Trading Co., a company involved in the property sector, according to disclosures.

The Volcker rule must be overhauled so that it doesn't impose an undue compliance burden and doesn't have an overwhelmingly adverse effect on liquidity, he says.

The last thing we want to do is to go back to what it was pre-2008," Richard Hunt, president and chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in an interview this week. "We believe in consumer protection. It has to be there."\par \par \uc2 The CBA, along with three trade groups representing credit unions and community banks, have made a joint request to the Senate to overhaul the CFPB by turning its single-director structure into a five-member bipartisan commission. The goal is to reduce their compliance burden and slow the pace of new regulations coming from the bureau.\par \par \uc2 But departing from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/understanding-the-financial-choice-act/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 previous iterations of his plan }}}\uc2 , Mr. Hensarling's latest agenda doesn't include the introduction of a commission and instead calls for keeping the single-director structure, albeit with less independence for the director.\par \par \uc2 And surprising experts, it lists steps that offer an edge to nonbank lenders over traditional banks\u8212\'20\'14a plan banks are sure to have issues with. Under the proposed repeal of the CFPB's supervisory authority, nonbanks in mortgage and auto financing and payday lending would largely escape regulatory scrutiny. Banks with assets of more than $10 billion would also be freed of CFPB supervision but would continue to be tightly monitored by banking regulators such as the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  and the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 "This is not a win for traditional banks," said Rohit Chopra, a former student-loan ombudsman at the CFPB.\par \par \uc2 It is unlikely the CFPB will be annihilated according to Mr. Hensarling's plan, and it's not just because of resistance from banks. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about what it wants to do with the agency. White House spokesman \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2  has called the CFPB unconstitutional, while \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2  , chief economic adviser to Mr. Trump and a former Goldman Sachs president, has suggested his focus was on a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-looks-to-restructure-cfpb-1486116000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 change in personnel }}}\uc2 , a step that would lead to Mr. Cordray's firing. Senate lawmakers, meanwhile, would likely seek less drastic measures than those unveiled by Mr. Hensarling, experts say.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Hensarling Drops Bid to Turn CFPB Into a Bipartisan Commission\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hensarling-drops-bid-to-turn-cfpb-into-a-bipartisan-commission-1486678230"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 House Financial Services Committee  }}}\uc2 Chairman \uc2 Jeb Hensarling\uc2  (R., Texas) is no longer seeking to turn the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  into a bipartisan commission, abandoning a long-sought goal for diffusing the bureau's single-director structure, according to a memo to committee leaders said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hensarling is expected to soon unveil a new version of legislation to significantly unwind key parts of financial laws enacted by the Obama administration, including limiting the power of the CFPB. A Feb. 6 memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal outlines changes Mr. Hensarling expects to make from a version he introduced in the prior Congress.\par \par \uc2 Pawlenty: Congress Unlikely to Make Big Changes to Financial Policy\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pawlenty-congress-unlikely-to-make-big-changes-to-financial-policy-1486720800"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Congress is unlikely to make major changes }}}\uc2  affecting the financial-services industry despite Republican control of both chambers as well as the White House, said Tim Pawlenty, a financial lobbyist and former GOP governor of Minnesota.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lot of remaining uncertainty about where the priorities will land and what could actually get done," Mr. Pawlenty, chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He had higher hopes that Democratic senators, particularly those representing states President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  won in November, might cooperate with Republicans on a tax-code overhaul or changes to the Affordable Care Act, but was skeptical that they would go along with Republican plans to make significant changes to the financial-regulatory regime.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation/graphics/Legislative-agenda-2017/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro Interactive: What Might Pass Congress? }}}\par \par \uc2 How the Fiduciary-Rule Review Is Likely to Play Out\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-fiduciary-rule-review-is-likely-to-play-out-1486660677"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 New retirement-savings rules }}}\uc2  set to take effect in two months are under threat after President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  's order to review the regulation with an eye toward repealing or rescinding it, leaving the financial-advice industry guessing about next steps.\par \par \uc2 The fiduciary rule, due to take effect April 10, is meant to ensure that advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings put clients' interests ahead of their own.

U.S. financial-services firms must quickly identify stress points for forthcoming trade talks, anticipate the adverse implications of changes in U.S. trade policy, and work with Congress and regulatory agencies to minimize the potential harm of trade policies to the financial sector, they write.\par \par \uc2 The Volcker Rule Is a 21st-Century Glass-Steagall Act\par \par \uc2 During his presidential campaign, \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  supported a "21st-century Glass-Steagall Act" without outlining exactly what that might look like. Such a policy could come out of the existing Volcker rule, which puts restrictions on banks' proprietary trading, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/a-21st-century-glass-steagall-its-called-the-volcker-rule"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 writes Christopher Whalen in American Banker }}}\uc2 . "Think of the Volcker rule as a halfway step back to the explicit and complete division between commercial and investment banking under Glass-Steagall," he writes. The Volcker rule must be overhauled so that it doesn't impose an undue compliance burden and doesn't have an overwhelmingly adverse effect on liquidity, he says. But nonetheless, "by separating the client activities such as lending and securities underwriting from principal trading for the bank's account, the Volcker rule addresses one of the most pernicious and least-discussed problems in the world of finance," Mr. Whalen writes.\par \par \uc2 You May Be in a Risky Business if Regulators Find It Distasteful\par \par \uc2 Charles W.

Mr. Calomiris calls for a review of such practices and an overhaul of how regulation works. "Regulation should be based on clearly defined standards, debated in public and enforced transparently. To accomplish that, Congress will have to change the regulatory process fundamentally."\par \par \uc2 Outwitting the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and the SEC\par \par \uc2 Steve Cohen\uc2  's fund was once the most successful on Wall Street.

It will also give the new administration a chance to quickly influence U.S. monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo's departure, effective early April, brings the number of vacant seats on the \uc2 Federal Reserve Board\uc2  to three out of seven. Donald Trump's views on monetary policy are unclear. But he is clearly of the view that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-reforms-are-stuff-of-banker-dreams-1486119392"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 excessive bank regulation has held back lending}}}\uc2 , harming the economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo, on the other hand, has been a leading advocate of forcing banks to hold more capital. "He was unusual in that he did have such strong views and such a forceful approach to decision-making," said Karen Petrou, analyst at Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , echoing a view of Mr. Tarullo {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/daniel-tarullo-the-one-man-judge-and-jury-for-banks-1464720855"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 shared by Wall Street and Washington}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tarullo pushed for the "gold-plating" of U.S. capital requirements, exceeding internationally agreed minimums, hoping other countries would follow suit. \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , the former \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  No. 2 and current director of the White House National Economic Council, seemed to object to this view last week, when he griped that U.S. banks are "way, way, way" ahead of European rivals in terms of capital levels.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mr. Tarullo has insisted that big capital cushions alone aren't sufficient. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-tarullo-criticizes-house-republicans-bank-reform-plan-1480702971"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 He recently objected}}}\uc2  to a proposal by Republican Congressman \uc2 Jeb Hensarling\uc2  that would exempt banks from broad swaths of regulation in return for higher capital ratios, saying it could prompt them to swap safer, liquid assets for riskier ones.\par \par \uc2 With Mr. Tarullo gone, the likes of Mr. Cohn and Mr. Hensarling have freer reign to put in place their own regulatory framework. It will be far more pleasing to bankers than the one Mr. Tarullo leaves as his legacy.\par \par \uc2 Write to Aaron Back at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:aaron.back@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 aaron.back@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Read More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/daniel-tarullo-federal-reserve-regulatory-point-man-resigning-1486751401"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Daniel Tarullo, Federal Reserve Regulatory Point Man, to Resign}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/daniel-tarullo-the-one-man-judge-and-jury-for-banks-1464720855"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Most Powerful Man in Banking}}}\uc2  (May 31, 2016)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170210ed2a00acb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Mr. Urfer didn't respond to messages seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 The PIF is at the center of the Saudi government's 15-year plan to overhaul its economy with measures including cuts to subsidies for power and gasoline, imposing taxes on its populace, and investing in businesses domestically and abroad.\par \par \uc2 Over the next two years, the country plans to take {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-aramco-ipo-wall-streets-white-whale-1465464606"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  a portion of its state-owned oil company public }}}\uc2  in an offering that could value the company at $2 trillion, and to use some proceeds of that offering for the PIF to make non-oil investments.\par \par \uc2 Those include tens of billions of dollars headed for private equity\u8212\'20\'14for which the PIF hired fund manager \uc2 Kevin O'Donnell\uc2 , formerly of California-based \uc2 Kaiser Permanente\uc2 , last year\u8212\'20\'14along with stocks, bonds and other investments.\par \par \uc2 Last year the PIF invested {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-raises-3-5-billion-from-saudi-fund-1464816529"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $3.5 billion in ride-hailing company  }}}\uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . and committed $45 billion to \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . f {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-group-launches-investment-fund-1476398189"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 or a technology fund }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Urfer, who is currently based in Geneva, worked in the 1990s at \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , where, according to his \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  page, he specialized in private banking and "achieved a major\u8212\'20\'14and unusually early\u8212\'20\'14promotion to VP." His \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  page says he later became head of private asset management at Swiss bank \uc2 Lombard Odier\uc2  before joining the \uc2 Abu Dhabi Investment Council\uc2 , a fund that invests globally for the Abu Dhabi government, as chief investment officer for fixed-income and equity investments. He left that role in 2011, and joined Gonet & Cie a year later.\par \par \uc2 At PIF, Mr. Urfer will be responsible for the stock and bond portfolios, key building blocks of a fund that has huge ambition but little experience. Typically, investing in stocks and bonds is the core strategy of a new fund, said Sven Behrendt, the Geneva-based head of consultancy GeoEconomica, which researches sovereign-wealth funds. "Then, slowly, you move into alternatives" like private equity, he said.\par \par \uc2 Saudi Arabia has taken a different route. For years, the country did little international investing compared with neighbors such as the United Arab Emirates. But last year, newly empowered Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crown-prince-returns-to-public-eye-as-succession-looms-1479378840"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 announced plans to change that }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Saudi Arabia, he said, needed to remake its economy. He hired a flotilla of consultants from the U.S., Europe and elsewhere and last year announced plans to build domestic industries like tourism and tech\u8212\'20\'14and sell a small portion of the state-owned \uc2 Saudi Arabian Oil Co\uc2 ., known as \uc2 Saudi Aramco\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said the PIF would become the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, and he made big private-equity deals before he finished restructuring the fund.\par \par \uc2 Prince Mohammed appointed Yasir al Rumayyan, a former Saudi banker and financial regulator, to head the fund. Like other sovereign-wealth funds, the PIF may rely heavily on hiring foreign investment experts. Setting up the fund "is going to take international experts to help Saudis navigate their new investment vehicle," said Theodore Karasik, a senior adviser at Gulf State \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which consults with companies on investing in the region.\par \par \uc2 Write to Justin Scheck at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:justin.scheck@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 justin.scheck@wsj.com }}}\uc2  and Summer Said at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:summer.said@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 summer.said@wsj.com }}}\uc2  and Summer Said at \par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170209ed2900565\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The regulation requires energy companies to report payments to foreign governments for the right to develop oil, gas and minerals.\par \par \uc2 But the win may be short-lived, largely because the congressional action\u8212\'20\'14which President Donald Trump is soon expected to sign into law\u8212\'20\'14didn't overturn the underlying provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law requiring the payment disclosures. Instead, it overturned only the SEC rule, which the agency completed in June after {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324436104578581523970826446"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a judge tossed out}}}\uc2  an earlier version of the measure.\par \par \uc2 More important, however, is the little-noticed fact that the SEC is required by law to take another stab at the rule within the next year. That means the regulation could very well make a comeback, meaning it's too early for its foes to rejoice.\par \par \uc2 Some background: To eliminate the SEC regulation, Congress acted under a law, the Congressional Review Act, that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-lawmakers-eye-freeze-on-obama-regulations-1479489099"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 lets lawmakers overturn recent agency rules}}}\uc2 . The law had previously been used successfully just once since it was passed in 1996: In 2001, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB985106234564009574"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Congress wielded it to scrap ergonomics rules}}}\uc2  finalized at the end of the Clinton administration that were aimed at preventing carpal tunnel syndrome and similar maladies.\par \par \uc2 Under the Congressional Review Act, agencies that see their work wiped out are given one year to redo their work after the enactment of a disapproval resolution, according to a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43992.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recent report}}}\uc2  on the act by the \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2  (see footnote 82). The only caveat is that the new version of the rule can't be "substantially" similar to the overturned measure.\par \par \uc2 What does this mean for the SEC? On the timing, it's clear the agency will have to come up with a new version of the rule by early 2018 (a legal deadline that, it's worth noting, will be nearly impossible for the agency to meet amid a leadership turnover). On the substance, nobody really knows, though SEC staff are in the early stages of figuring out what "substantially" similar" means, according to people familiar with their internal deliberations.\par \par \uc2 The SEC could water down the rule significantly or simply tinker around the edges a bit so that it's easier for the industry to comply. For sure, the Republican-led SEC is likely to err on the side of the former option rather than the latter. But one thing is certain: the SEC will have to act again, perhaps to the consternation of the industry that has fought for years against the disclosures.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 White House Weighs Suspending \u8216\'20\'18Conflict Minerals' Rule\par \par \uc2 By Samuel Rubenfeld and Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration is considering executive action to suspend a regulation, backed by human-rights groups and loathed by many businesses, that requires a swath of industries to investigate whether their products contain metals that could have been sold by armed groups.\par \par \uc2 The proposed executive action, drafted last week and reviewed Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal, would suspend for two years the so-called conflict-minerals rule, which business groups have fought in court, saying its requirements are costly and burdensome.\par \par \uc2 The rule requires companies to disclose any tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in their supply chains. The minerals are used in an array of products, from iPhones to engagement rings. Human-rights groups say the rule led companies to buy fewer materials connected to militia groups.\par \par \uc2 According to the text of the proposed executive action, reviewed by the Journal, the disclosure regime required by the rule "was intended to address a humanitarian crisis in the region," but instead "mounting evidence" shows it "caused harm to some parties" in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and it "contributed to instability in the region" and "threatened the national security interest of the United States."\par \par \uc2 A White House spokesman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Reuters reported earlier Wednesday that a draft order on the conflict minerals existed, but not what was in it.\par \par \uc2 It isn't clear whether President Donald Trump will sign the order, or sign it in the form in which it was circulated. Dozens of draft executive action documents have circulated in recent weeks; only a handful have been signed and released by the White House.\par \par \uc2 The rule, which was established under the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law and went into effect in 2012, mandates companies to file reports on their use of these minerals to the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Parts of the conflict-minerals rule were invalidated in 2014 after an appellate court decided it violated companies' rights to free speech following a lawsuit by the \uc2 National Association of Manufacturers\uc2 , the Business Roundtable and the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 . Companies have struggled to comply with its remaining elements, according to a 2015 study from Tulane University and the consulting firm Assent Compliance; 90% of the nearly 1,300 companies that filed conflict-minerals reports in 2014 couldn't determine whether their products were conflict-free, the study found.\par \par \uc2 Human-rights groups responded angrily to reports of the proposed order. \uc2 Global Witness\uc2 , which said it spent a decade tracing the role of conflict minerals fueling human-rights abuses in the Congolese region and played a role in the rule's passage, called the proposal "an abuse of power," saying a suspension would benefit corrupt business practices.\par \par \uc2 "Suspending this provision could actually undermine U.S. national security," said Carly Oboth, a policy adviser for Global Witness, in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The proposed order comes days after the acting SEC chairman, Michael Piwowar, said the agency would reconsider how to enforce the rule. In a statement posted Jan. 31 to the SEC's website, Mr. Piwowar said the disclosure requirements have caused a de facto boycott of minerals from parts of Africa.\par \par \uc2 "Legitimate mining operators are facing such onerous costs to comply with the rule that they are being put out of business. It is also unclear that the rule has in fact resulted in any reduction in the power and control of armed gangs or eased the human suffering of many innocent men, women and children in the Congo and surrounding areas," he said in the statement.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street lawyers said the move would fit into the Trump administration's view that the Dodd-Frank law created a thicket of regulation that burdened public companies and inhibited growth.\par \par \uc2 "You have to start knocking out these things that are discouraging public companies from listing here," said Norm Champ, a partner at \uc2 Kirkland & Ellis LLP\uc2  who was formerly the SEC's director of investment management.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Texas Judge Upholds Fiduciary Rule, but Its Fate Remains in Doubt\par \par \uc2 By Lisa Beilfuss\par \par \uc2 A U.S. District Court judge in Texas ruled against business groups seeking to quash the Labor Department's new retirement-savings rule, though a re-evaluation of the rule ordered by President Donald Trump may render the ruling moot.\par \par \uc2 The Labor Department's fiduciary rule, approved last spring and due to take effect April 10, is meant to ensure that advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings put clients' interests ahead of their own. The Obama administration had said such conflicted advice costs Americans $17 billion a year and pushes down annual returns on their retirement savings by a percentage point.\par \par \uc2 Many officials in the wealth-management industry have said those figures are inflated, and a number of parties had filed legal challenges to the rule and against the Labor Department.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's ruling by Chief Judge Barbara Lynn of the Northern District of Texas addressed one of those legal challenges, rejecting an argument led by the Chamber of Commerce that the Labor Department had exceeded its authority in approving the fiduciary rule.\par \par \uc2 "The fiduciary rule does not exceed the \uc2 DOL\uc2 's authority," Judge Lynn wrote, adding that "Congress...assigned the \uc2 DOL\uc2  the power to regulate a significant portion of the American economy, which the \uc2 DOL\uc2  has done since the statute was enacted"\par \par \uc2 The Chamber of Commerce, in a statement after Judge Lynn's ruling, said: "We continue to believe that the Department of Labor exceeded its authority, and we will pursue all of our available options to see that this rule is rescinded."\par \par \uc2 The latest legal victory for the Labor Department's rule, as well as two other victories in other court cases, may not mean much for the regulation's fate. Last Friday, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum directing the Labor Department to study the rule's impact and rescind or revise it if it isn't consistent with his administration's regulatory principles. Those principles, laid out in a separate executive order, "empower Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the market place, save for retirement, and build individual wealth."\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the Labor Department said Wednesday "the \uc2 DOL\uc2  is exploring all options to delay the applicability date." Many experts say a delay in the rule's April 10 applicability date would be the first logical step in re-evaluating the rule and potentially revamping or rescinding it.\par \par \uc2 Still, some experts say the string of legal wins may make it tougher for the rule to be revised or rescinded. "I think it creates a stumbling block for the Trump administration" as it goes "back to the drawing board," said Erin Sweeney, an attorney at Miller & Chevalier Chartered who represents parties in litigation regarding fiduciary obligations. "The Labor Department has to address the fact that three district courts have upheld the rule."\par \par \uc2 Trump Preparing to Nominate CFTC's Giancarlo as Chair\par \par \uc2 By Andrew Ackerman\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The Trump administration is preparing to nominate J. Christopher Giancarlo as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to people familiar with the matter, elevating the former brokerage executive to the full-time head of the top U.S. derivatives regulator.\par \par \uc2 If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Giancarlo is expected to adopt a more industry-friendly approach to overseeing banks and other financial firms in the multi-trillion-dollar derivatives market. He could ease the commission's swap-trading requirements and aspects of the CFTC's plan to boost oversight of high-frequency trading firms. He would fill the role vacated by Timothy Massad, who stepped down as chairman at the end of the Obama administration on Jan. 20.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giancarlo, the commission's sole Republican at the moment, began serving as its acting chairman the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration. The Senate would have to vote to confirm him for the full-time role.\par \par \uc2 Though the Trump administration has yet to publicly say it plans to nominate Mr. Giancarlo, \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , Mr. Trump's senior economic adviser, in a private meeting last week indicated he would likely get the nod, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Cohn told Mr. Giancarlo he should act as though he were the full-time chairman, this person said, suggesting the acting chairman wasn't merely keeping the top CFTC seat warm for another individual.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giancarlo's nomination is not yet set in stone and the White House plans could still change. But the search for Mr. Massad's successor has long focused on Mr. Giancarlo. Few if any other individuals have been seriously considered for the role.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giancarlo declined to comment. A White House official declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giancarlo's likely nomination would mark the second time the Trump administration has turned to an existing commissioner to fill the top post at his respective agency. The White House in January tapped Ajit Pai, a GOP member of the \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2 , to be that commission's chairman.\par \par \uc2 As with Mr. Pai, Mr. Giancarlo outlined an alternative regulatory vision while in the minority party at the CFTC. Mr. Giancarlo's focus has been on trading rules for swaps, which he maintains have been unsuitable because they aren't in accord with what Congress intended.\par \par \uc2 Prior to joining the CFTC in 2014, Mr. Giancarlo, an attorney, was an executive vice president at swaps broker GFI Group Inc., one of several firms affected by new swaps rules under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.\par \par \uc2 He crafted a 90-page white paper in 2015 outlining an alternative trading framework for swaps, which were blamed for deepening the 2008 meltdown. The trading changes envisioned by Mr. Giancarlo, which were rejected by Mr. Massad when the GOP commissioner floated them two years ago, would entail giving firms more leeway in the way they execute swaps trades. It also envisions the introduction of examinations for swaps traders and brokers in a bid to enhance the professionalism of the industry.\par \par \uc2 More broadly, Mr. Giancarlo supports provisions of Dodd-Frank that overhauled swaps, including routing them to clearinghouses that guarantee trades. His likely appointment signals the Trump administration is unlikely to follow through on its campaign promise to fully "dismantle" the Dodd-Frank law.\par \par \uc2 It could be months before Mr. Giancarlo has the chance to alter the CFTC's regulations, due to the commission's depleted ranks and partisan divides that could slow the refashioning of any rules. Just prior to leaving office last month, President Barack Obama renominated two people to fill longstanding vacancies at the commission\u8212\'20\'14one Democrat and one Republican. Yet industry officials and congressional aides said it appeared unlikely the Senate would act on the pair, who failed to advance through the chamber last year.\par \par \uc2 Swaps, contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based on fluctuations in interest rates or other benchmarks, were targeted by U.S. lawmakers for greater oversight and transparency after they played a central role in the financial crisis. Companies use the swaps market to hedge risks or make bets in areas such as fuel prices or interest rates.\par \par \uc2 Regulators and lawmakers, concerned the opacity of the swaps allowed bad bets to build up outside the eyes of overseers, have moved since the crisis to ensure the wagers are traded publicly and reported to U.S. authorities\u8212\'20\'14an initiative Mr. Giancarlo also backs.\par \par \uc2 In addition to criticizing the CFTC's trading requirements, Mr. Giancarlo has attacked aspects of a proposal that would allow the agency to expand its access to the computer code that drives automated trading strategies. Mr. Giancarlo insists the CFTC should only get the code through a subpoena, echoing industry views.\par \par \uc2 He has also said he would work to grant firms greater flexibility on a March 1 implementation date for new margin requirements for certain swaps. He suggested in a speech this month the U.S. should follow the lead of other countries in adopting a phased-in approach to the requirements.\par \par \uc2 Labor Secretary Pick Andy Puzder Set for Feb. 16 Hearing\par \par \uc2 By Eric Morath\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump's pick for labor secretary, \uc2 Andy Puzder\uc2 , filed his financial disclosure paperwork this week, clearing the way for a Senate committee to schedule his long-delayed confirmation hearing.\par \par \uc2 The paperwork outlined the plan for Mr. Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants Holdings Inc., to divest from the parent company of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's fast-food chains, and more than 200 other businesses and investments.\par \par \uc2 His stake in \uc2 CKE\uc2  is valued between $10 million and $50 million, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The paperwork was filed Tuesday with the \uc2 Office of Government Ethics\uc2  but has not yet been made publicly available.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Puzder will sell his interest back to the company, which is majority-owned by private-equity firm \uc2 Roark Capital Group\uc2 . He did not list an interest in Roark among his assets. Mr. Puzder initially sought to move his \uc2 CKE\uc2  assets into a blind trust, but was told that wasn't a workable solution by the ethics office, according to an attorney informally advising him. The CEO plans to resign from \uc2 CKE\uc2 , and positions with the International Franchise Association and the \uc2 American Enterprise Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a letter outlining his plans, Mr. Puzder wrote he would complete the sale of \uc2 CKE\uc2  assets\u8212\'20\'14and seek to collect his 2016 bonus and more than $250,000 in relocation benefits tied to the company's recent move to Tennessee\u8212\'20\'14prior to taking office, if confirmed. If the transactions aren't completed before that time the proceeds would be forfeited, he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Puzder said he would not participate in any dealings involving \uc2 CKE\uc2  during his time as secretary. \uc2 CKE\uc2 , like many large employers, has had complaints filed against it and its franchisees with various divisions of the Labor Department.\par \par \uc2 He would also sell off dozens of stocks and investment funds, including holdings in \uc2 Toyota Motor Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  and \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . He said it could take six months or longer to divest from 13 specific investment funds that could be difficult to liquidate. Pre-existing confidentiality agreements limit what he knows about the holdings in some of those funds, the letter stated. He said he would work to develop a recusal mechanism with regard to those assets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Puzder will retain some investments, including California bonds and three properties. The paperwork showed Mr. Puzder has received $3.4 million in salary and bonuses from \uc2 CKE\uc2  in the past year.\par \par \uc2 The hearing, which has been delayed several times, is now set for Feb. 16, a spokeswoman for Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), the chairman of the committee overseeing Mr. Puzder's confirmation, said Wednesday. Sen. Alexander made filing the paperwork a requirement for the hearing to take place.\par \par \uc2 At the hearing, Mr. Puzder will likely need to answer questions about an undocumented-immigrant housekeeper he employed for several years. Earlier this week, Mr. Puzder said he failed to pay proper taxes during her term of employment and only made the required payments after Mr. Trump tapped him in December to run the department that oversees wage-and-hour and worker-safety rules.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), a member of the committee, said Tuesday she wants to hear a fuller explanation from Mr. Puzder. She was one of two Republicans to vote against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who was confirmed this week.\par \par \uc2 But Sen. Alexander and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) both said the failure to pay taxes related to the housekeeper should not disqualify Mr. Puzder from the role, and influential Washington business groups including the Chamber of Commerce and \uc2 National Restaurant Association\uc2  remain supportive of his nomination.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, both committee members, have criticized Mr. Puzder since he was selected for the role. They organized a Capitol Hill forum at which workers from Carl's Jr. restaurants said they were asked to work through breaks and report to work while sick. Most Carl's Jr. and Hardee's locations are operated by franchisees, not the corporation.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Trump and Brexit Pose New Questions for Financial Regulation\par \par \uc2 By Stephen Fidler\par \par \uc2 Europe has spent the years since the financial crash constructing an edifice of regulation to curb excessive risk-taking by banks and other financial institutions. With the last bricks almost in place, two factors threaten to bring the building down: Donald Trump and Brexit.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's administration has raised two pertinent questions. Will it embark on an aggressive deregulation of the financial system, leaving deeply different regulatory regimes on either side of the Atlantic? And, if so, will it abandon its efforts for international coordination?\par \par \uc2 Brexit also boosts uncertainty, not least around the consequences of London, Europe's financial capital, no longer being inside the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and its financial institutions not necessarily bound by EU regulations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has made clear he believes Americans are getting a raw deal in trade with other countries. His appointees have also suggested they think European banks are gaining unfair advantages over their U.S. counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , Mr. Trump's senior economic adviser, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week that American banks were at "a huge disadvantage relative, especially, to the European banks," largely because the American banks were carrying much fatter capital cushions.\par \par \uc2 "We have the best, most highly capitalized banks in the world, and we should use that to our competitive advantage," Mr. Cohn added. "But on the flip side, we also have the most highly regulated, overburdened banks in the world."\par \par \uc2 Most financial experts say Europe was much slower than the U.S. in cleaning up its banks post-crisis and there are still lingering problems, including non-performing loans, in some countries.\par \par \uc2 But European banks say one important reason their capital ratios are below that of their American counterparts is because they can't sell off capital-hungry mortgages to government-sponsored enterprises, as U.S. banks do. And, they say, a glance at the success of American banks in European investment-banking league tables doesn't suggest they are laboring under huge competitive disadvantages.\par \par \uc2 It isn't clear how the Trump administration will follow through on its wish to deregulate. Its executive order last week on regulation of the financial system was so vague, one EU official said this week, that it could have come from one of the bloc's own politicians. More than that, there is some "gold plating" of regulation in the U.S. that could be stripped away without challenging international norms.\par \par \uc2 But if the new U.S. administration does fixate on deregulation and freeing up its banks, the EU will face a serious choice: Does it follow suit or try to go its own way? And what happens to international efforts in Basel and elsewhere to assure a level international playing field for financial institutions?\par \par \uc2 European anxieties over this have been heightened by the recent letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen from Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), vice-chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.\par \par \uc2 In it, he questioned the Fed's continued participation in international forums coordinating international financial regulation that have in the past "unfairly penalized the American financial system in areas as varied as bank capital, insurance, derivatives, systemic risk and asset management."\par \par \uc2 Some already suspect they know how Europe will respond. "What the U.S. does, the rest of the world does three years later," Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Mar\u237\'00\'EDa Rold\u225\'00\'E1n, a former central banker who now heads the \uc2 Spanish Banking Association\uc2 , told a conference in Brussels this week.\par \par \uc2 Beyond trans-Atlantic uncertainties, it isn't clear either what path the U.K. will take post-Brexit. In its negotiations with the bloc, Britain will probably seek to prioritize access to financial markets in the rest of the EU. That tack would limit the country's ability to deregulate aggressively because it would have to closely follow EU rules.\par \par \uc2 But the U.K. may decide on a more aggressive deregulatory approach to compete with the EU, offering a looser regulatory regime to attract business to the City of London. Indeed, even if it seeks privileged access to the EU, negotiations over a new relationship with the bloc could break down and make that goal unattainable.\par \par \uc2 There are other risks for the EU. Cutting the bloc off from London and its hypercompetitive financial cluster\u8212\'20\'14responsible for the bulk of European trading of foreign exchange, derivatives and other instruments\u8212\'20\'14would risk raising the cost of capital for EU enterprises.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, much of the EU's strategy to reduce Europe's heavy dependence on banks\u8212\'20\'14its plan for a so-called Capital Markets Union\u8212\'20\'14has centered on using London to increase the use of financial markets to raise capital.\par \par \uc2 Europe faces challenges, then. And the new approaches from across the Atlantic and the English Channel also represent challenges to global finance. Perhaps international capital flows will survive uninterrupted as policy settles into a new dynamic. Alternatively, greater fragmentation of the global financial system could loom, marking a return to markets divided along national or regional lines and a much more inefficient allocation of capital\u8212\'20\'14leaving Europe and the world poorer as a result.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Greece's Never-Ending Fiscal Drama\par \par \uc2 By Simon Nixon\par \par \uc2 No one wants another Greek debt crisis, least of all just ahead of a series of knife-edge elections in Europe. No one this time is trying to push Greece out of the eurozone. No one thinks what Greece needs now after eight years of acute depression is another dose of austerity. Nor does anyone seriously think Greece's current debt burden is sustainable. So why is Greece once again back in the headlines, its future in the eurozone again called into question amid yet another standoff with its creditors?\par \par \uc2 The official explanation is that Greece's bailout program is being held up by a dispute over the country's fiscal targets. Under the deal struck in 2015, Greece is supposed to achieve a primary surplus before interest payments in 2018 of 3.5% and maintain this surplus for the medium term. Germany says medium term should mean 10 years; the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  would prefer it to mean one or two years. This matters because Germany has said it would only continue to fund Greece's bailout if the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  puts money in too\u8212\'20\'14and the IMF will only participate if the numbers add up. The lower the surplus target, the bigger the debt relief needed to make the numbers add up. That is a problem for Germany.\par \par \uc2 To make matters more complicated, the IMF takes a very pessimistic view of Greece's current fiscal position. It now seems clear that Greece delivered a primary surplus of at least 2% in 2016, far above the initial program target of minus 0.5%. With the Greek economy now growing, the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  is confident the country can achieve the 3.5% target for 2018 with few extra fiscal measures. But the IMF says this year's surplus was largely due to one-off factors and is sticking to its forecast that the surplus will only amount to 0.9% in 2018. Just to reach the 3.5% target in 2018, the IMF says Greece will need to legislate in advance extra austerity measures equivalent to 2% of gross domestic product. Athens says this is politically impossible. Brussels agrees.\par \par \uc2 Of course, this dispute isn't really about deficit targets. At its heart lies a fundamental clash over how the eurozone should operate. Germany and the IMF share an extremely low opinion of the quality of Greece's political class and institutions. But from this they have drawn different conclusions. Berlin believes Athens can't be trusted to stick to any fiscal or reform commitments except under strong external pressure; it follows that if Greece is to remain in the eurozone, it needs to be kept on a short leash. Berlin will keep funding Athens, but it wants to maintain leverage over the country's economic decision-making to protect German taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 But the IMF sees this as a recipe for perpetual can-kicking fundamentally at odds with its own institutional priorities. The IMF exists to provide short-term assistance to countries in financial difficulties, helping them put their finances so they can return quickly to borrowing from the financial markets. The IMF's credibility has already been battered by one failed Greek program and is determined not to be sucked into another. For the IMF, therefore, this Greek program must be the last\u8212\'20\'14and given its extreme low confidence in the Greek political class, a program is unlikely to be successful without very substantial debt relief. The IMF's position has been clear for two years, but many Europeans assumed it was bluffing.\par \par \uc2 How this standoff now gets resolved is far from clear. One option is that Greece capitulates to what many in Europe consider to be the IMF's unreasonable austerity demands. But could any Greek government of any stripe deliver austerity measures worth an additional 2% of GDP? Another option is that Germany capitulates on the deficit targets. But could Berlin execute such a humiliating U-turn, committing to writing off more than \u8364\'20\'AC100 million ($107 million) of Greek debt just months before an election? Another option would be for the IMF to walk away from Greece altogether, leaving the eurozone to sort out its own mess. But how could it do this without pulling the rug from under German and Dutch participation too, making Greece's plight far worse?\par \par \uc2 Greece's best hope is that a compromise can be thrashed out in which Berlin accepts lower medium-term surplus targets, the IMF adopts less gloomy forecasts, and Athens is left to legislate a much smaller package of extra austerity measures. But a compromise along these lines currently looks some way off. Meanwhile the clock is ticking. The Feb. 20 meeting of eurozone finance ministers is the last chance to agree on a deal before the Dutch parliament is dissolved ahead of that country's general election in March. The next opportunity to strike a deal might not come until after the French presidential election in May. By then all the current momentum may be lost, including a package of ambitious reforms currently agreed as part of the program review. Worse, a giant bond redemption in July will be looming, raising the risk that Greece finds itself back where it was in 2015\u8212\'20\'14exactly where no one wants it to be.\par \par \uc2 Top Fed Lawyer Scott Alvarez to Retire This Year\par \par \uc2 By David Harrison\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve general counsel Scott Alvarez will retire this year after a 36-year career at the central bank, the Fed said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 In his dozen years as the Fed's top lawyer, Mr. Alvarez quietly became one of the central bank's most influential officials. His reach was so broad that he has sometimes been referred to as the eighth Fed governor, or "Governor Alvarez."\par \par \uc2 In 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, he helped guide the Fed as it sought to bring stability to Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 That year, Fed officials rolled out the broadest financial rescue programs since the Great Depression. The central bank created lending programs for banks, securities dealers, money-market funds and other parts of the financial industry while also helping to bail out \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  and working with other regulators to take over insurance giant \uc2 American International Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the aftermath of the crisis, the Fed bought Treasury and mortgage bonds worth trillions of dollars in an effort to bolster the economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Alvarez, 61 years old, also was responsible for the Fed's implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law overhauling banking regulation in the wake of the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 He drew the attention of lawmakers in 2014 when he suggested at a conference that Congress reconsider a Dodd-Frank rule known as the "swaps push-out" rule that required banks to spin off certain derivatives trading activities into separate units that wouldn't have access to the government safety net.\par \par \uc2 The rule, he said, had been drafted "in the middle of the night."\par \par \uc2 His comment led Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) to rebuke the Fed lawyer during a congressional hearing with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Fed staffers "should not be picking and choosing which rules to enforce based on their personal views," Ms. Warren told Ms. Yellen.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen said she had no intention of trying to alter the rules contained in Dodd-Frank and later released a statement expressing confidence in Mr. Alvarez's "expert advice and counsel."\par \par \uc2 In 2015, Mr. Alvarez was in charge of an investigation into an alleged leak of sensitive market-moving information on monetary policy in 2012.\par \par \uc2 "Scott advised successive chairs, including myself, with deep expertise and utmost integrity," Ms. Yellen said in a statement Wednesday. "I am enormously grateful for his wise counsel, calmness and good humor during times of stress."\par \par \uc2 The Fed's board of governors will begin looking for his successor, the central bank said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Alvarez launched his Fed career as a staff attorney in 1981.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers Try to Stop State-Sponsored Retirement Plans\par \par \uc2 By Anne Tergesen\par \par \uc2 Two Republican congressmen have introduced measures that would effectively prevent small businesses from automatically enrolling workers in individual retirement accounts under state or locally sponsored retirement plans.\par \par \uc2 Eight states\u8212\'20\'14including California, Connecticut and Oregon\u8212\'20\'14have recently enacted retirement-savings programs for residents without access to a workplace plan\u8212\'20\'14and dozens more are considering similar measures. Most of the measures require employers to automatically deduct as much as $5,500 a year\u8212\'20\'14or as much as $6500 for workers older than 50\u8212\'20\'14from employees' paychecks for deposit into an IRA. Cities considering such plans include New York and Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 The first of these state-run programs is expected to start in 2017, according to AARP, the advocacy group for older Americans. The group estimates some 55 million full- and part-time private-sector workers in the U.S. lack access to retirement-plan coverage through work.\par \par \uc2 The goal of the congressmen's effort is to scrap two Labor Department rulings last year that paved the way for state or local auto-enrollment programs.\par \par \uc2 The first Labor Department ruling, issued in August, clarified that state-sponsored retirement programs with auto-enrollment wouldn't be covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which sets minimum standards for pension and 401(k) retirement plans. That ruling effectively removed a concern on the part of some states that their programs would be pre-empted by federal regulations\u8212\'20\'14and paved the way for states to set up plans that require payroll deduction IRA accounts.\par \par \uc2 The second Labor Department regulation, completed in December, allowed cities and counties above a certain size to sponsor their own auto-enrollment plans.\par \par \uc2 The congressional sponsors\u8212\'20\'14Rep. Tim Walberg (R., Mich.) and Rep. Francis Rooney (R., Fla.)\u8212\'20\'14contend the Labor Department's regulation allowing auto-enrollment "will discourage small businesses from offering private-sector plans" and force people "into government-run plans with fewer protections and less control over their hard-earned savings."\par \par \uc2 Their measures are being proposed under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to block resolutions passed in recent months from taking effect. Use of the act is common when there is a change in administration, says Will Hansen, senior vice president at the ERISA Industry Committee, which advocates for large employers on health, retirement and compensation policies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hansen says large employers that operate in multiple states are concerned the state-run plans might issue different rules requiring them to auto-enroll some employees\u8212\'20\'14including temporary and seasonal workers and some new employees\u8212\'20\'14who may not be eligible to participate in their 401(k)-type plans.\par \par \uc2 "It's a huge burden for employers to have to figure out how to comply" with rules that may differ from state to state, he says, adding that employers would be responsible for setting up automatic payroll deductions for employees who must be auto-enrolled in the state plans.\par \par \uc2 The resolutions' chances of passing both the House and Senate aren't clear.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, AARP executive vice president Nancy LeaMond said: "Congress should support these important state savings programs, not take steps to end them."\par \par \uc2 "Today, 55 million working Americans do not have a way to save for retirement out of their regular paycheck\u8230\'20\'26.Those who do not save enough for retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net programs, costing taxpayers down the line."\par \par \uc2 The measure wouldn't affect New Jersey and Washington state, which avoid coverage mandates in favor of establishing state-run marketplaces to help small companies shop for a retirement plan if they choose to offer one.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Trump Fixes Flaw in Postcrisis Regulatory Crackdown\par \par \uc2 By Greg Ip\par \par \uc2 When President Donald Trump ordered a comprehensive review of financial regulations last week, brows furrowed. "Very worrisome," fretted Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank. Will banks "blow up our economy again?" asked Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren.\par \par \uc2 The worriers should relax. In the 10 years since the financial crisis began, the regulatory pendulum has moved relentlessly in the direction of tougher restrictions on finance. Mr. Trump's order reverses the direction of the pendulum but there is little sign his administration wants it back to where it was in 2007.\par \par \uc2 His order does, however, address a serious flaw in the post-crisis regulatory crackdown: In pursuit of financial stability and consumer protection, it largely ignored the costs of forgone lending, economic growth and consumer choice. Mr. Trump has signaled those costs must now be taken into account. He has asked his Treasury Secretary (now awaiting confirmation) to report back in 120 days on how well current regulations promote growth, efficiency and competitiveness. Over time, that could generate a better balanced supply of credit to a wider range of companies and households without making the financial system much riskier.\par \par \uc2 The Dodd-Frank Act, the financial overhaul law that Barack Obama championed and Congress passed in 2010, prescribed rules on mortgage underwriting and derivatives and heightened oversight of "systemic" financial institutions, including those that aren't banks. It also provided a mechanism for winding down these institutions when they fail, imposed limits on speculative trading by banks and created the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Dodd-Frank is just part of the picture. The CARD Act, passed in 2009, imposed new restrictions on credit cards. Internationally negotiated rules have raised how much capital and liquid assets banks must hold. Civil and criminal enforcement has also brought new scrutiny to mortgages, international money transfers and auto loans. The Department of Labor's new fiduciary standard strongly discourages investment advisers from charging commissions for trading in retirement accounts.\par \par \uc2 Yet regulators never attempted to quantify how much this reduced the risk of a crisis, or at what cost. Banks are certainly safer thanks to higher capital, but it's unclear what, if any, benefit provisions such as the ban on proprietary trading have delivered.\par \par \uc2 In theory, heightened regulation would raise the cost of credit and reduce growth, but this is difficult to measure because so many factors determine credit growth.\par \par \uc2 The most notable hit has been to mortgages to less creditworthy home buyers. In one 2014 study, \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  found that the cost of credit where regulation and litigation have bit hardest, such as small- and medium-size business loans, credit cards and home equity loans, had risen relative to those loans with comparatively less regulatory burden, such as autos and large companies. In a 2015 followup, Goldman argued regulation has created a "two-speed" economy that favors big companies over small business and startups.\par \par \uc2 Regulations combined with near-zero interest rates have carved into banks' profitability; their share prices today remain 24% below their pre-crisis peak while the overall market is up about 50%.\par \par \uc2 Karen Petrou, who runs the financial-services consulting firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , says banks have been forced to prioritize fee-generating business, often with wealthy customers. Financial companies, many web-based, can service smaller businesses and lower-income consumers. But some charge far more than banks. Moreover, Ms. Petrou notes, they may not survive the next downturn.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's order demands more "rigorous regulatory impact analysis" that is a better assessment of the costs and benefits of new rules, and more consideration to allowing investors "informed choices."\par \par \uc2 He also signaled skepticism of the Labor Department's fiduciary standard, which restricted financial advisers from charging transaction-based fees to retirement savers. The Obama Administration claimed this would save investors $17 billion a year in fees. But \uc2 the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association\uc2 , an industry group, disputed that figure, and argued it ignored the benefit those fees may have paid for, such as advice.\par \par \uc2 The regulatory change with the best chance of preventing another financial crisis is the dramatic increase in capital that banks must hold to absorb future losses. While the Trump administration may discourage capital requirements from rising further, it doesn't appear to plan on rolling them back much. "We don't want to go back to the good old days," \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , director of Mr. Trump's National Economic Council, told The Wall Street Journal last week. "In fact, one of the big competitive advantages that we have in the United States \u8230\'20\'26 is that we have the best, most highly-capitalized, banks in the world."\par \par \uc2 The prospect of regulatory relief has propelled financial stocks up some 17% since the election, contributing more than a fifth of the broader market's entire advance, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. This suggests that finance should be more profitable, and that more credit may start flowing to those businesses and households that have struggled to find it. That could revive the appetite for risk in those parts of the economy where it has been most absent.\par \par \uc2 Chinese Companies Rush In With Nearly $2 Trillion Where Bankers Fear to Lend\par \par \uc2 By Rachel Rosenthal and Anjie Zheng\par \par \uc2 Chinese companies are increasingly stepping in as lenders, as banks reduce their funding to struggling industries and the country's mammoth bond market comes under strain.\par \par \uc2 Company-to-company loans in China jumped by 20% last year to 13.2 trillion yuan ($1.92 trillion), according to research firm CEIC. That is roughly double the size of the loan book at \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., the U.S.'s biggest lender. This entrusted lending, so named because banks serve as middlemen, is now the fastest-growing major component of the country's elaborate system of informal, or shadow, banking.\par \par \uc2 The most recent surge came during the selloff in China's $9.3 trillion bond market late last year. Big, cash-rich companies\u8212\'20\'14mostly state-owned enterprises and some private companies\u8212\'20\'14stepped in: New entrusted loans rose to 405.7 billion yuan ($59.02 billion) in December, more than double the month prior, according to data tracker Wind Information, and the highest monthly issuance in two years.\par \par \uc2 But the practice poses broader risks for China's economy.\par \par \uc2 Instead of investing in their core business, companies can earn interest rates of up to 20% making entrusted loans, often with only cursory checks on borrowers' creditworthiness. Such lending often props up companies in sectors like mining and property where Beijing wants to reduce excess capacity. It also adds to China's $18 trillion corporate debt pile, already equal to 168% of gross domestic product, according to the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some entrusted loans are between a company and its own subsidiaries, similar to how many big companies globally loan cash to different parts of their businesses. Still, between 2007 and 2013 more than 60% of entrusted loans were channeled to companies in industries with overcapacity, according to a study by the U.S.-based \uc2 National Bureau of Economic Research\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It's not a sustainable business model" for the lending companies, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics. "Their main operations are only staying afloat by acting like a shadow bank."\par \par \uc2 Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd\uc2 ., or Chalco, is one major company where lending has become a big business. With its main smelting operations struggling due to a glut of aluminum, the company has ramped up its lending to boost profits. Chalco, a publicly traded unit of state-owned \uc2 Chinalco\uc2 , took in 30.7 million yuan in interest income from entrusted loans in the first six months of 2016\u8212\'20\'14more than four times as much as a year earlier and nearly 50% of its net profit. In a texted response to a request for comment, Chalco said the increase in entrusted lending was part of an effort to centralize capital management and employ assets flexibly while lowering funding costs.\par \par \uc2 Company-to-company lending took off in China in the 1990s when, after a period of rapid growth, many state-owned firms started generating large amounts of cash. With no private shareholders pushing for dividend payouts, many put that cash to work by lending it out.\par \par \uc2 Big corporations in other countries have in the past built large financing arms. \uc2 GE Capital\uc2 , a unit of \uc2 General Electric\uc2 , at one point became a top lender in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 But entrusted lending is unusual. Banks are involved, but only as a middleman: Direct company-to-company lending is still legally prohibited. Banks can charge fees of up to 5% of the loan, according to BMI Research, but leave credit checks to the lending company.\par \par \uc2 "When a bank lends, they have to do their homework, they have experienced credit analysts," said Warut Promboon, chief ratings officer at Chinese firm Dagong Global Credit Rating Co. Mr. Promboon added that in his experience, few Chinese companies have the personnel to adequately assess credit risks.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, lending companies aren't pulling back even when loans sour.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18When a bank lends, they have to do their homework, they have experienced credit analysts.'\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Warut Promboon, Dagong Global Credit Rating\par \par \uc2 In June, \uc2 Datang International Power Generation Co\uc2 ., a state-owned energy company, said it would write off $8 billion of its $10 billion portfolio of entrusted loans made a year earlier to small coal companies in which it owned stakes.\par \par \uc2 "If our subsidiaries suffer more, it will make it more difficult for them to get bank loans," said a Datang International representative. "In this case, we may issue more entrusted loans."\par \par \uc2 Entrusted lending can provide a last-ditch option for companies blacklisted from other funding avenues. Chinese banks aren't allowed to extend normal loans to companies in default.\par \par \uc2 In December, \uc2 China Cinda Asset Management Co\uc2 . agreed to provide \uc2 Shandong Shanshui Cement Group Ltd\uc2 . an entrusted loan of up to 8 billion yuan ($1.16 billion). The loan's terms weren't disclosed; Shanshui declined to comment. China Cinda couldn't be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 Shanshui, one of China's biggest cement makers, had defaulted on nearly 12 billion yuan ($1.75 billion) of its debt as of June 2016, according to disclosures. A slump in China's cement industry drove defaults and bondholder lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 Companies sometimes charge sky-high rates for loans to risky industries. \uc2 Zhejiang Longsheng Group Co\uc2 ., a privately owned chemicals producer whose customers include \uc2 Nike Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 ., according to its website, is charging 17% interest\u8212\'20\'14four times China's one-year benchmark lending rate\u8212\'20\'14for a one-year, 250 million yuan loan to Zhejiang Time Square Trading Co., a company involved in the property sector, according to disclosures. Neither company could be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Carol Chan contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 China Tells Bitcoin Exchanges to Follow Forex Rules\par \par \uc2 By Chao Deng\par \par \uc2 SHANGHAI\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 China's central bank\uc2  issued its harshest warning yet to the domestic bitcoin industry, saying that platforms trading the virtual currency risk being shut down if they skirt rules on money laundering and foreign exchange.\par \par \uc2 The People's Bank of China\uc2  delivered the warning to nine bitcoin trading platforms in a meeting on Wednesday, reminding them about potential legal, policy and other risks. Central-bank officials told the exchanges not to violate regulations on money laundering, foreign-exchange management, payment and other issues, according to a statement from the Beijing-based operations office of the central bank issued on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Should such a violation be found, the central bank said, "the circumstance will be serious" and an inspection team will close down the offending exchange.\par \par \uc2 The rhetoric marks an escalation following weeks of sparring between the central bank and the exchanges over risks associated with their businesses. Among the concerns is whether the virtual currency's largest market is becoming a venue for overly risky speculation and capital flight.\par \par \uc2 "People in the industry are watching if the regulators do more," said Wen Hao, founder of Bitpie, a Beijing-based bitcoin-related business, who was not part of the meeting. "They've never said they would close a business. Based on that statement, they are getting more strict."\par \par \uc2 Representatives for the nine, mostly smaller platforms involved in Wednesday's meeting either couldn't be reached or declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Moves to further rein in the exchanges show just how much the Chinese authorities have hardened their views on the industry this year. Demand in China for the virtual currency has been rising in recent months, fueled by the Chinese yuan's depreciation, and that has heightened regulators' concern that bitcoin may help Chinese move money across the borders, circumventing capital controls.\par \par \uc2 Traders have said that bitcoin doesn't aid capital flight. Only about $2 billion worth of bitcoin purchased last year is estimated to have left China, a trickle in overall capital flows, estimates \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 , a New York startup that tracks the movement of bitcoin. Bitcoin's technology, though, allows the currency to move across borders, outside banking channels via the so-called blockchain network, and be deposited on an exchange where it then can be converted into a foreign fiat currency.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin prices climbed over the recent Lunar New Year holiday and earlier this week reached as high $1,067 per bitcoin, according to the CoinDesk's bitcoin prices index. The index put the price at about $1,065 midday Thursday in China.\par \par \uc2 As bitcoin prices staged their recent run-up, China's foreign-exchange reserves fell below $3 trillion, their lowest level in six years. Authorities have been redoubling efforts to plug the channels allowing money to leak out, chiefly by tightening rules on individual bank transfers and corporate acquisitions.\par \par \uc2 The exchanges called to meet with central bank officials on Wednesday included BtcTrade.com, HaoBTC, Yunbi, Yuanbao.com, and BTC100. Excluded from the meeting were China's three largest bitcoin trading platforms by volume which have been under inspection by the central bank since January.\par \par \uc2 The central bank previously said that two of them, Huobi and OKCoin, didn't institute proper controls to prevent money-laundering while the third, BTCC, was in violation of rules by providing capital services. These exchanges have in response imposed trading fees and canceled margin trading, or trading with borrowed money, to cool speculation.\par \par \uc2 Bobby Lee, the CEO of Shanghai-based BTCC, said this week that the exchanges are waiting for further regulations; central bank officials went to BTCC last weekend for meeting. Mr. Lee said that the latest moves are more "scare tactics."\par \par \uc2 Beyond the exchanges, the central bank has yet to call into question related bitcoin businesses, from providing "wallets"\u8212\'20\'14the applications that manage storage of bitcoin\u8212\'20\'14to the creation, or "mining" of bitcoin via computer processes.\par \par \uc2 Still, the recent announcement means that bitcoin exchanges will be under pressure to look more closely at who their customers are and where their money comes from, said Mr. Hao of Bitpie, which makes bitcoin wallets. "As with any finance-related business, authorities would be worried more about anti-money-laundering."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Lenders Shouldn't Just Rely on Stadtwerke's Implicit Municipal Support\par \par \uc2 Lenders should focus more on the cash flow-based standalone credit quality of German municipal utilities, known locally as Stadtwerke, than implicit guarantees, says Scope Ratings. Granted, given the status of Stadtwerke as public utilities and the loss of "prestige" for municipal shareholders if the fail, local authorities may support them via equity injections and new shareholder loans at times of stress. But this should be a secondary issue, especially when it comes to utilities whose municipal shareholders are under financial pressures themselves. Stadtwerke are active in bank loans and Schuldschein.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  ordered a comprehensive review of financial regulations last week, brows furrowed. "Very worrisome," fretted \uc2 Mario Draghi\uc2 , president of the European Central Bank. Will banks "blow up our economy again?" asked Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren.\par \par \uc2 The worriers should relax. In the 10 years since the financial crisis began, the regulatory pendulum has moved relentlessly in the direction of tougher restrictions on finance. Mr. Trump's order reverses the direction of the pendulum but there is little sign his administration wants it back to where it was in 2007.\par \par \uc2 His order does, however, address a serious flaw in the post-crisis regulatory crackdown: In pursuit of financial stability and consumer protection, it largely ignored the costs of forgone lending, economic growth and consumer choice. Mr. Trump has signaled those costs must now be taken into account. He has asked his Treasury Secretary (now awaiting confirmation) to report back in 120 days on how well current regulations promote growth, efficiency and competitiveness. Over time, thatcould generate a better balanced supply of credit to a wider range of companies and households without making the financial systemmuchriskier.\par \par \uc2 The Dodd-Frank Act, the financial overhaul law that \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  championed and Congress passed in 2010, prescribed rules on mortgage underwriting and derivatives, and heightened oversight of "systemic" financial institutions,including thosethat aren't banks. It also imposed limits on speculative trading by banks and created the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Dodd-Frank is just part of the picture. The CARD Act, passed in 2009, imposed new restrictions on credit cards. Internationally negotiated rules have raised how much capital andliquid assetsbanksmust hold. Civil and criminal enforcement has also brought new scrutiny to mortgages, international money transfers and auto loans. The Department of Labor's new fiduciary standard strongly discouragesinvestment advisers fromcharging commissionsfor trading inretirement accounts.\par \par \uc2 Yet regulators never attempted to quantify how much this reduced the risk of a crisis, or at what cost. Banks are certainly safer thanks to higher capital, but it's unclear what, if any, benefit provisions such as the ban on proprietary trading have delivered.\par \par \uc2 In theory, more regulation would raise the cost of credit and reduce growth. But it is difficult to measure because so many factors determine credit growth.\par \par \uc2 The most notable hit has been to mortgages to less-creditworthy home buyers. In a 2014 study,\uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  found the cost of credit where regulation and litigation have bit hardest, such as small- and medium-size business loans, credit cards and home equity loans, had risen relative to loans with comparatively less regulatory burden, such as autos and large companies. In a 2015 followup, Goldman argued regulation has created a "two-speed" economythat favors big companies over small business and startups.\par \par \uc2 Regulations combined with near-zero interest rates have carved into banks' profitability; their share prices today remain24% below their pre-crisis peak while the overall market is upabout 50%.\par \par \uc2 Karen Petrou, who runs the financial-services consulting firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , says banks have been forced to prioritize fee-generating business, often with wealthy customers. Financial companies, many web-based, can service smaller businesses and lower-income consumers. But some charge far more than banks. Moreover, Ms. Petrou notes, they may not survive the next downturn.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's order demands more "rigorous regulatory impact analysis" that is a better assessment of the costs and benefits of new rules, and more consideration to allowing investors "informed choices."\par \par \uc2 He also signaled skepticism of the Labor Department's fiduciarystandard, which restricted financial advisers from charging transaction-based fees toretirement savers. TheObama Administration claimed this would save investors $17 billion a year in fees. But \uc2 the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association\uc2 , an industry group, disputed that figure, saying it ignored the benefit those fees may have paid for, such as advice.\par \par \uc2 Theregulatory change with the best chance of preventing another financial crisis is the dramatic increase in capital that banks must hold to absorb future losses.While the Trump administration may discourage capital requirements from rising further, it doesn't appear to plan on rolling them back much. "We don't want to go back to the good old days," \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , director of Mr. Trump's National Economic Council, told The Wall Street Journal last week. "In fact, one of the big competitive advantages that we have in the United States . . . is that we have the best, most highly-capitalized, banks in the world."\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw380\pich378\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal7600\pichgoal7560

But eventually Mr Wang turned to Tencent founder Ma Huateng , who gave him almost $200m, valuing his young start-up at $1bn.\par \par \uc2 One reason for these investors' enthusiasm for Mr Wang was his history at BGI, which is now a leading genome sequencing organisation that works closely with the \uc2 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\uc2 . When it goes public in Shanghai as soon as next month, its listing is expected to generate big returns for Sequoia and other early investors.\par \par \uc2 Not long ago, Chinese tech largely meant Alibaba's ecommerce business and Tencent's social media empire built around its \uc2 WeChat\uc2  app. That is no longer the case. The sector is becoming broader, more value-added and more lucrative. While most investors are increasingly bearish about China's macro prospects, many are relatively optimistic about the country when it comes to technology. In areas ranging from robotics and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to medical devices and fintech, China is making the transition from imitator to innovator. That raises the prospect of huge gains for investors fortunate enough to get in early. One recent list of the top technology groups that are still private worldwide from CB Insights shows that four out of the top 10 are based in China, compared with five from the US and one from India.\par \par \uc2 A glimpse at the offer memo for private equity firm Warburg Pincus's newly raised, specialised China fund shows just how profitable investing in Chinese tech can be.\par \par \uc2 Before last year Warburg, which rarely sponsors highly specialised funds, invested in Chinese transactions through its global fund. It invested $1.5bn in mainland Chinese groups in 2015 alone and made 2.2 times its money on average over the past decade. A $92m investment in \uc2 58.com\uc2 , a Chinese online classified company, turned into $700m or a return on investment of almost eight times, on a gross basis, while the $29m Warburg put in \uc2 Koudai.com\uc2 , an advertising platform that focuses on mobile ecommerce, is now worth $650m. The two are among Warburg's most valuable China investments as measured by return on money invested.\par \par \uc2 "Last year was the year the Chinese dragon roared," noted a recent report from \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  on fintech investing. "Asia has overtaken North America as the number one fintech investment destination driven by the Chinese dragons." The bank estimated that venture capital investment into China doubled in 2016, while it fell 38 per cent in the US. Chinese companies accounted for 46 per cent of all global VC investment in the sector.\par \par \uc2 Chinese tech companies have also played a role in shifting the character of the big emerging market indices. "The MSCI EM index is now an IT-heavy index," notes Morgan Stanley. Not only have information technology companies outperformed their local peers, but the sector's role was further enhanced by the addition of the huge Chinese internet companies to the index. The IT sector now accounts for 23 per cent of the index, "making it the most IT heavy of the major indices", \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  adds.\par \par \uc2 Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have long looked down on tech start-ups across the Pacific and highlighted the constraints on Chinese innovation. Many local universities still embrace Confucian rote learning, and loyalty to the Communist party plays a role in the selection of top administrators and research grant recipients.\par \par \uc2 Chinese tech groups aim to change those attitudes. Mr Wang's iCarbonX is seeking to create a "digital" or virtual health profile of clients, to identify their risks for a range of diseases and come up with a plan to reduce those risks. Last month he revealed eight investments worth $350m that he has made in US medtech groups. Such developments make it harder to analyse companies as just Chinese or just American. But iCarbonX and peers argue US-China deals should increasingly be seen as mergers of equals.\par \par \uc2 henny.sender@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170208ed280001s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For more than a year, Trident Capital Cybersecurity has been investing in startups that scour the deep web, protect industrial control systems and even one led by the former chief of the \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, the firm will announce it has closed its first fund at $300 million.\par \par \uc2 The oversubscribed fund had targeted $200 million, according to a regulatory filing in 2015. The cybersecurity-focused fund spun out of \uc2 Trident Capital\uc2 , where Don Dixon and \uc2 Alberto Yepez\uc2 , the founders of Trident Capital Cybersecurity, served as managing directors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dixon and Mr. Yepez are joined by Sean Cunningham, the former director of investments at Intel Capital. They also have hired Will Lin, formerly of \uc2 Trident Capital\uc2 , as vice president. The firm is currently in the process of hiring a fourth partner.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yepez said the firm intends to use the fund exclusively as a lead investor, and it originally planned to raise $150 million\u8212\'20\'14until limited partners balked.\par \par \uc2 "They said, \u8216\'20\'18If you're going to be true lead investors, you're going to need more,' " Mr. Yepez said.\par \par \uc2 The fund closes as venture capitalists are resetting on cybersecurity investment. In 2016, venture investment in cybersecurity totaled $1.7 billion, down from $3.4 billion in 2015, according to data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource.\par \par \uc2 Trident Capital Cybersecurity is one of the largest funds that specializes in cybersecurity. Others include TenEleven Ventures and Allegis Capital.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yepez and Mr. Dixon say a differentiating aspect of the firm is its advisory council, a network of co-investors, industry executives, government officials and strategic acquirers. The council, which launched in 2015, includes FireEye Chief Executive \uc2 Kevin Mandia\uc2  and former U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers. Members can invest in a side vehicle that invests in Trident Capital Cybersecurity portfolio companies.\par \par \uc2 "Our secret sauce is working with the customers first, the chief information security officers," Mr. Dixon said.\par \par \uc2 Trident Capital Cybersecurity has already made investments in five companies out of the fund, including IronNet Cybersecurity, a company led by former National Security Agency Chief Keith Alexander, and 4iQ, which finds information on the deep and dark web following breaches.\par \par \uc2 The firm plans to focus on emerging security threats, specifically securing the Internet of Things, payments, identity platforms and behavioral \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and privacy.\par \par \uc2 The fund will focus primarily on Series A and B investments where Trident Capital Cybersecurity can lead the round. Mr. Dixon said the firm plans to invest in 23 companies, making about eight investments a year. A typical investment will be about $15 million.\par \par \uc2 Write to Cat Zakrzewski at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170208ed28004xt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Despite a federal hiring freeze instituted by executive order last month, one private equity-backed company is positioning itself to generate some heat for its services.\par \par \uc2 Salient CRGT Inc., which provides outsourced technology services such as data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and cybersecurity to government agencies, is using the change as way to further expand its reach into previously underpenetrated markets.\par \par \uc2 The company, which is backed by \uc2 Bridge Growth Partners\uc2  and \uc2 Frontenac Co\uc2 ., announced this week it was purchasing \uc2 Information Innovators Inc\uc2 ., a company providing health care-focused government agencies with services such as managing call centers, enterprise deployment and remote management. Customers of their products include the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  and \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Salient CRGT, which already has a base of government customers, including the Defense Technology Security Administration, \uc2 U.S. Postal Service\uc2 , U.S. Air Force and \uc2 U.S. Social Security Administration\uc2 , will use the new acquisition as a way to expand its footprint in agencies that serve the health-care space.\par \par \uc2 Alok Singh\uc2 , a co-founder and managing principal at Bridge Growth, said that when the deal for \uc2 Information Innovators\uc2  closes, health care-focused customers will make up 25% of Salient CRGT's customer base, from 2% currently.\par \par \uc2 Salient CRGT is seeking growth at a time when President Trump's hiring freeze could create more opportunities for contractors to fill in the gaps left by retiring federal workers, which could increase the need for outsourced IT providers and products.\par \par \uc2 As the new administration implements changes to the way the federal government does business, this could potentially increase spending in other areas as well. As it does, it is conceivable companies providing software and information technology services for government agencies, infrastructure-focused products and tools to help businesses deal with proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act will also see more attention from investors.\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170208ed28004y1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . this week is launching a joint effort with big software companies and startups to find ways to use new financial technologies to combat fraud and bribery in government services.\par \par \uc2 The initiative, called Citi Tech For Integrity Challenge, will join \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 's public-sector group with tech companies including \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 ., and startups globally, the bank said. The aim is to help programmers at tech firms to develop new applications using \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 's and the partners' software for governments to do things like block illicit payments, protect financial data, or help deliver aid to poor or crisis-hit regions.\par \par \uc2 The initiative is the latest example of broadening "fintech," which has focused largely on new tools for consumers, like online loans or mobile payments. Banks also generate billions of dollars in revenue from corporations and governments, so finding ways to apply technology to those businesses would justify big investments.\par \par \uc2 That includes finding ways to apply technologies such as mobile-payment apps, photo-recognition software, blockchain -- the networking system originally developed for bitcoin, but which banks have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to apply to their own businesses -- and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to government payment systems. These systems often use technology to manage the government's payment process, but ultimately then deliver funds in cash that isn't trackable.\par \par \uc2 "Officials elected on anticorruption platforms told us they don't have the tools to change what's happening further down" the payments system, said Julie Monaco, global head of \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 's public-sector group in the bank's corporate and investment-banking unit. "We want them to talk to the fintech team and figure out how to plug in."\par \par \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  may invest in some of the new initiative's applications via its venture group or partner to use them for its own services.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20170208000028"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170208ed280000l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc62}{\*\bkmkend toc62}\b \uc2 The Property Report: Big Investors Trim Real-Estate Holdings --- Moves are a sign the bull market in U.S. commercial property could be ending\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Grant   \par \uc2 773 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 February 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)\par \uc2 AWSJ\par B9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Some prominent real-estate investors are reducing their holdings and getting more selective about new deals, in a sign that the eight-year bull market for U.S. commercial property is coming to a close.\par \par \uc2 Asset managers at pension funds and endowments, as well as private-equity firms and other big investors, are throttling back on new acquisitions, selling more assets and shifting to less risky strategies as a way to protect against potential losses in a downturn.\par \par \uc2 Additional selling could put stress on the market because demand for property has started to flag. Deal volume decreased by $58.3 billion, or 11%, in 2016, the first annual decrease since 2009, according to data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a sign that investor appetite is waning.\par \par \uc2 Investors that have picked up the pace of selling to lock in profits include private-equity firm \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2 , real-estate giant \uc2 Brookfield Asset Management\uc2 , \uc2 United Parcel Service Inc\uc2 .'s pension trust and \uc2 Harvard Management Company\uc2 , which manages \uc2 Harvard University\uc2 's endowment.\par \par \uc2 When these big investors do buy, they are focusing more on niche properties such as self-storage warehouses and biomedical facilities, which haven't seen the sharp price rise of trophy office buildings and rental apartments.\par \par \uc2 "We definitely have a risk-off mentality," said Judy McMahan, a portfolio manager for UPS's $32 billion pension trust. "We're being careful." The pension trust sold more property than it bought last year, and its new acquisitions included senior housing and industrial space in the U.K., Ms. McMahan said.\par \par \uc2 Brookfield also increased the pace of its selling, unloading about $3 billion in property in 2016 compared with about half that much in 2015. The company recently put on the block a 49% stake in its sprawling Brookfield Place complex in Manhattan. The complex just finished overhauling its retail space and filling the 2.5 million square feet of office space emptied in 2013 when \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 . moved out.\par \par \uc2 "We think now is an opportune time to reduce some of our exposure to that asset," said \uc2 Brian Kingston\uc2 , Brookfield senior managing partner. "We can recycle the capital into higher returning investment opportunities."\par \par \uc2 Caution among investors in the $11 trillion U.S. commercial-property sector is being driven by lofty prices, the length of the market cycle so far and the recent rise in interest rates, which makes bonds look more attractive.\par \par \uc2 Few investors predict a crash along the lines of the 2008 downturn because debt levels aren't nearly as high and the economy continues to show signs of strength. Some believe office buildings, malls, apartment buildings and other commercial property will continue to enjoy rising rents and occupancy rates if President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's pro-growth economic plans work as intended.\par \par \uc2 Since 2009, investors have been handsomely rewarded for purchases of office buildings, warehouses, apartment buildings and other commercial property. Thanks to low interest rates and the improving U.S. economy, a valuation index published by \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2  has increased 107% since hitting its crash-era low in May 2009. But that rocketing growth is slowing. The Green Street index, which focuses on top-quality U.S. property owned by real-estate investment trusts, has stayed flat since mid-2016, according to Green Street.\par \par \uc2 Another closely followed metric -- an index compiled by the \uc2 National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries\uc2  -- showed total returns from commercial real estate rising 9.2% in the year ended Sept. 30, 2016, a sharp decline from 13.5% for the 12 months ended in the third quarter of 2015 and growth ranging from 11% to 14% in each of the previous five years.\par \par \uc2 Much of the bull market has been fueled by low interest rates, which encouraged investors to forsake bonds and stretch for more yield. But rates have jumped since Election Day. Real-estate investment trusts took the first hit, with equity REITs declining 2.9% in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a gain of 5.3% for the S&P 500, according to Green Street.\par \par \uc2 This year through Monday, equity REITs have had a total return of 0.38%, compared with 1.9% for the S&P 500, Green Street said.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  sold more property than it bought last year, according to \uc2 Kenneth Caplan\uc2 , the firm's chief investment officer for real estate. Sales have included more traditional property types such as apartment buildings and hotels.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20170207000015"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170207ed2800006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The price paid for the portfolio has not been disclosed.\par \par \uc2 The deal, which comprises performing and non-performing loans, comes weeks after AnaCap signed an agreement to buy \uc2 Barclays\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 French retail banking operations.\par \par \uc2 The disposal of \uc2 Barclays\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 Italian loans \u8212\'20\'14 expected to complete in the second quarter \u8212\'20\'14 will cut its noncore risk weighted assets by \u163\'00\'A378m. \uc2 Barclays\uc2  is aiming to reduce its noncore business, targeting risk weighted assets of about \u163\'00\'A320bn, by the end of this year.\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2  offloaded its Italian retail business to CheBanca, a subsidiary of Mediobanca Group, last year for a loss of \u163\'00\'A3258m.\par \par \uc2 Although the AnaCap deal removes the last of \uc2 Barclays\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 noncore corporate loans in Italy, the bank still has a large mortgage book as well as other retail loans in the country, which it will wind down over time. \uc2 Barclays\uc2  will retain its investment and corporate banking business in the country.\par \par \uc2 Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, said last year that accelerating the rundown of its noncore portfolios was \u8220\'20\'1Ca key part\u8221\'20\'1D of the bank\u8217\'20\'19s strategy to \u8220\'20\'1Cclose the gap between the group\u8217\'20\'19s returns and those in our strong core business\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 In the past year, \uc2 Barclays\uc2  has completed the sale of a number of divisions, including its Portuguese and Italian retail banks, southern European cards business, Asian wealth unit and index and risk \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business.\par \par \uc2 The Italian government agreed a deal last year for banks to package bad loans with a state guarantee, to make them easier to sell to private investors.\par \par \uc2 Last year, AnaCap acquired three portfolios for \u8364\'20\'AC2.5bn of non-performing Italian corporate loans from \uc2 GE Capital\uc2 , \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2  and \uc2 UniCredit\uc2 , as part of a clear-out of the country\u8217\'20\'19s bad debts.\par \par \uc2 AnaCap\u8217\'20\'19s banking investments include Aldermore in the UK, MeDirect in Belgium, \uc2 Mediterranean Bank\uc2  in Malta, Equa bank in the Czech Republic and Nest Bank in Poland.

Its shares have risen 44 per cent over the past year.\par \par \uc2 But the bank\u8217\'20\'19s inability to rein in its cost base, which was inflated by \u8364\'20\'AC1.3bn of unexpected regulatory costs, led to its failure to meet one of its previous six targets: to cut its operating costs to no more than two-thirds of revenue.\par \par \uc2 The French bank said on Tuesday it aimed to lower costs as a proportion of revenues from 66.8 to 63 per cent by 2020, helped by planned investments in automation, improved data usage and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Its net profits rose from \u8364\'20\'AC7bn to \u8364\'20\'AC7.7bn last year, as revenues outpaced costs, while provisions for bad loans fell and it booked fewer one-off charges. It raised its dividend from \u8364\'20\'AC2.31 to \u8364\'20\'AC2.70 per share, giving investors a yield of 4.6 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The bank\u8217\'20\'19s top performing division was its international financial services arm, which includes its consumer finance, insurance, asset management and US retail banking. This unit reported a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits.\par \par \uc2 The domestic retail unit, which has a network of branches in France, Belgium and Italy, was held back by low interest rates, but still managed a 1.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. The corporate and investment bank suffered a 1.2 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, but this was blamed on currency movements and one-off items.\par \par \uc2 Alongside a relatively ambitious 2.5 per cent annual revenue growth target for the next three years, the bank aims to raise its dividend payout ratio from 45 per cent to 50 per cent.\par \par \uc2 It also aims to lift its return on equity from 9.4 per cent last year to above 10 per cent by 2020, and to increase its common equity tier one ratio \u8212\'20\'14 a vital benchmark of financial strength \u8212\'20\'14 from 11.5 per cent to above 12 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170207ed27001md\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Also, developers are adding new supply of some property types at the fastest rate since the recovery began.              \par \par \uc2 Few investors predict a crash along the lines of the 2008 downturn because debt levels aren't nearly as high and the economy continues to show signs of strength. Some believe office buildings, malls, apartment buildings and other commercial property will continue to enjoy rising rents and occupancy rates if President Donald Trump's pro-growth economic plans work as intended.              \par \par \uc2 But certain property types are weakening. Under siege by online shopping, retail space saw "signs of a correction" last year with 30 metropolitan areas showing an increase in vacancy over 2015, according to \uc2 Reis Inc\uc2 ., a data firm.             \par \par \uc2 In the office market, the largest commercial real estate sector in terms of value, tenants occupied an additional 38.5 million square feet in 2016, thanks to the expanding economy, Reis said. But that was down from 44.5 million square feet of "absorption" in 2015.             \par \par \uc2 Also office rent growth decelerated partly because "tenants continue to lease less square feet per employee than they had in previous recoveries," Reis said.              \par \par \uc2 Investors that have picked up the pace of selling to lock in profits include private-equity firm \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2 , real-estate giant \uc2 Brookfield Asset Management\uc2 , \uc2 United Parcel Service Inc\uc2 .'s pension trust and \uc2 Harvard Management Co\uc2 ., which manages \uc2 Harvard University\uc2 's endowment.                          \par \par \uc2 When these big investors do buy, they are focusing more on niche properties such as self-storage warehouses and biomedical facilities, which haven't seen the sharp price rise of trophy office buildings and rental apartments.             \par \par \uc2 "We definitely have a risk-off mentality," said Judy McMahan, a portfolio manager for UPS's $32 billion pension trust. "We're being careful."             \par \par \uc2 The pension trust sold more property than it bought last year, and its new acquisitions included senior housing and industrial space in the U.K., Ms. McMahan said.             \par \par \uc2 Brookfield also increased the pace of its selling, unloading about $3 billion in property in 2016 compared with about half that much in 2015. The firm is using the capital to buy niche property types that haven't seen such sharp increases in pricing, like self-storage facilities and student housing in the U.K.             \par \par \uc2 The company recently put on the block a 49% stake in its sprawling Brookfield Place complex in Manhattan. The complex just finished overhauling its retail space and filling the 2.5 million square feet of office space emptied in 2013.              \par \par \uc2 "We think now is an opportune time to reduce some of our exposure to that asset," said \uc2 Brian Kingston\uc2 , Brookfield senior managing partner. "We can recycle the capital into higher returning investment opportunities."             \par \par \uc2 Since 2009, investors have been handsomely rewarded for purchases of office buildings, warehouses, apartment buildings and other commercial property.             \par \par \uc2 Thanks to low interest rates and the improving U.S. economy, a valuation index published by \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2  has increased 107% since hitting its crash-era low in May 2009. But that rocketing growth is slowing. The Green Street index, which focuses on top-quality U.S. commercial property owned by real-estate investment trusts, has stayed flat since mid-2016, according to Green Street.             \par \par \uc2 Another closely followed metric\u8212\'20\'14an index compiled by the \uc2 National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14showed total returns from commercial real estate rising 9.2% in the year ended Sept. 30, 2016, a sharp decline from 13.5% for the 12 months ended in the third quarter of 2015 and growth ranging from 11% to 14% in each of the previous five years.             \par \par \uc2 Fund investors are pulling back as well. Quarterly distributions and redemptions from open-ended funds that buy low-risk properties, a popular investment vehicle among institutional investors, doubled during the first nine months of 2016, after ticking up just 11% in 2015, according to the council.             \par \par \uc2 Much of the bull market has been fueled by low interest rates, which encouraged investors to forsake bonds and stretch for more yield. But rates have jumped since Election Day. Real-estate investment trusts took the first hit, with equity REITs declining 2.9% in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a gain of 5.3% for the S&P 500, according to Green Street.             \par \par \uc2 This year through Monday, equity REITs have had a total return of 0.38%, compared with 1.9% for the S&P 500, Green Street said.              \par \par \uc2 Also, until recently, the rise in property values was fueled by developers keeping new supply in check. But that, too, is beginning to change with certain property types. For example, more than 378,000 new apartments are expected to be completed across the country this year, almost 35% more than the 20-year average, according to real-estate tracker Axiometrics Inc.             \par \par \uc2 Private investors say the real estate they are chasing these days often is either real estate that is less risky or properties that can be improved and sold quickly, rather than those\u8212\'20\'14like developments\u8212\'20\'14that might not be finished until the economy is well into the next down cycle.             \par \par \uc2 For example, private-equity giant \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . moved quickly to find a buyer last year after it purchased the landmark Sullivan Center in the Chicago Loop for $267 million. A few months after the deal closed, \uc2 KKR\uc2  sold the retail portion of the 946,000-square-foot building to \uc2 Acadia Realty Trust\uc2 .              \par \par \uc2 "Given we are in the later stage of the real-estate cycle, we have been focused on business plans that require less time to create value," said Chris Lee, co-head of real-estate credit at \uc2 KKR\uc2 .              \par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  sold more property than it bought last year, according to \uc2 Kenneth Caplan\uc2 , the firm's chief investment officer for real estate. Sales have included more traditional property types such as apartment buildings and hotels. One of its biggest buys last year was \uc2 BioMed Realty Trust Inc\uc2 ., which leases offices to the life-science industry. "It's later in the cycle where you have to be more targeted," Mr. Caplan said.             \par \par \uc2 Harvard's endowment is among the big institutions that sold more property last year than it purchased, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for the endowment declined to comment.             \par \par \uc2 Institutions that sell property acknowledge values could keep rising, but said they want to play it safe.             \par \par \uc2 "Some of the investments we disposed of, if we held on to them another year or so, it's possible we'd make more money," said Ms. McMahan of UPS. "However, we felt it was the appropriate time to monetize our gains."             \par \par \uc2                  Write to Peter Grant at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:peter.grant@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 peter.grant@wsj.com}}}\par \par \par \par \uc2 Property Report                                                       \par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/office-landlords-roll-out-new-perks-1486468803"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Office Landlords Roll Out New Perks}}}\par \par \par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investment-firm-sells-industrial-property-portfolio-for-1-07-billion-1486484817"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Investment Firm Sells Industrial Property Portfolio for $1.07 Billion}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170207ed270028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . this week is launching a joint effort with software giants and startups to find ways to use new financial technologies to combat fraud and bribery in government services.\par \par \uc2 The initiative, called Citi Tech For Integrity Challenge, will partner \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 's public-sector group with tech companies including \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 ., and \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 ., and startups globally, the bank said. The aim is to help programmers at tech firms to develop new applications using \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 's and the partners' software for governments to do things like detect and block illicit payments, protect financial data, or help deliver aid to poor or crisis-hit regions.\par \par \uc2 The initiative is the latest example of broadening "fintech," which has so far focused largely on new tools for consumers, like online loans or mobile payments. Banks also generate billions in revenue from corporations and governments, so finding ways to apply technology to those businesses would justify big investments.\par \par \uc2 That includes finding ways to apply technologies such as mobile payments apps, photo-recognition software, blockchain\u8212\'20\'14the networking system originally developed for bitcoin, but which banks have spent hundreds of millions trying to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-backs-blockchain-for-savings-on-derivatives-1483979438"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 apply to their own businesses}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to government payments systems. These systems often use technology to manage the government's payment process, but ultimately then deliver funds in cash that isn't trackable.\par \par \uc2 "Officials elected on anti-corruption platforms told us they don't have the tools to change what's happening further down" the payments system, said Julie Monaco, global head of \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 's public-sector group in the bank's corporate and investment banking unit, noting that about 70% of fintech spending currently goes toward consumer usage. "We want them to talk to the fintech team and figure out how to plug in."\par \par \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  may invest in some of the new initiative's applications, which could be sold to government clients, via its venture group, or partner to use them for its own services. But the bank says it is also hoping to spur investments by other partners and independent development for activities like communicating with citizens and reforming bureaucracies.\par \par \uc2 In a presentation on the initiative, \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  cited a Global Financial Integrity study that African countries in 2011 lost $77 billion due to illicit financial flows.\par \par \uc2 Governments including the U.S. are among \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 's customers in its business selling services to help move large volumes of payments and other money transfers globally, known as Treasury and Trade Solutions.\par \par \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  doesn't disclose figures for government-client revenue. Public-sector transaction services revenue grew "double digits" last year, thanks in part to governments adding new technologies to their payments systems, the bank said. Overall Treasury and Trade Solutions revenue was $8.1 billion in 2016, up 4% from the prior year.\par \par \uc2 Banks are using technology to remake their businesses in the wake of post-financial crisis rules restraining risk-taking.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Blair Hull believes that investors owe it to themselves to do some market timing\u8212\'20\'14if they do it analytically, not emotionally, and don't do too much of it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hull is the founder of Hull Tactical Asset Allocation in Chicago, which runs the $95 million \uc2 Hull Tactical US ETF\uc2  (HTUS). He made a living at blackjack, spending the early 1970s as a card counter (the art of expertly tracking the cards that have been dealt).\par \par \uc2 As a trader, Mr. Hull always wanted to take an approach similar to card counting\u8212\'20\'14basing his moves more on a system than a hunch. So it's no surprise that Hull Tactical Asset Allocation plays the S&P 500 index the way Mr. Hull played blackjack, using an array of data to time each market move.\par \par \uc2 He spoke with The Wall Street Journal about why market timing makes more sense in the 21st century than it did in the past, and how it should fit into an investor's portfolio. Here are edited excerpts from that interview.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: You say there are similarities between market timing and counting cards. What are they, and how do they give the investor an edge?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: You have 10 different indicators in a deck of cards: You have 2 through 9, and you have 10s [including face cards] and aces. That's a total of 10 numbers.\par \par \uc2 And we have 10 indicators\u8212\'20\'14or something like that, it can be a few more or less depending on the model\u8212\'20\'14for our trading programs. How do we count them? We do it with science, looking at the various indicators, which show when there is a time to be in or out of the market.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: How big of an edge can you create?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: I played blackjack for five years from 1971-75, getting an advantage of, at best, 51-49 [wins to losses]. If we can get a slight advantage in the market, say 55-45, and we sustain that over a long period of time, we will have the odds in our favor and will actually gain more wealth than if we just went buy-and-hold. I think that's possible.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Your system is all about removing emotion from the market, yet one indicator you rely on in some models is \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Isn't that injecting emotion?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: We're not making emotional decisions about \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , or any of the other indicators used in any of our models.\par \par \uc2 We read the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feed, and we look at the sentiment that occurs on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , people tweeting about the S&P 500 and whether they are bullish or bearish. If they are bullish for a certain amount of time, it's time to sell the market; if they're bearish for a certain amount of time, it's a signal to buy.\par \par \uc2 If the sentiment is sustained long enough, it becomes meaningful and we factor it in with the other indicators; there's nothing emotional about that.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Why have you changed your mind about buy-and-hold investing?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: I haven't. It's still right for most people and most of their money. Timing is very hard.\par \par \uc2 Jack Bogle [founder of \uc2 Vanguard Group\uc2 ] was correct when he said that, in the last century, buy-and-hold was the best strategy, but since 2000 we have had this explosion of data, and along with that explosion has come predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques that we really didn't have before.\par \par \uc2 Right now, you have very few academic papers saying you can't time the market. Right now, they all say it's possible, and they have a vast number of ways people are trying to do it.\par \par \uc2 A lot of those approaches aren't going to work\u8212\'20\'14they are too susceptible to fear and greed and are run by emotions\u8212\'20\'14but I think it's possible to have a systematic approach that gives you better returns for less risk, adding something to your portfolio.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Despite that belief, you don't believe in putting most of your money at risk through market timing, do you?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: The strategy fits in the alternative-investment area\u8212\'20\'14essentially, it's hedge-fund performance at retail prices\u8212\'20\'14but alternative strategies should be 5% or 10% of the typical investor's portfolio. That doesn't change just because there's a market-timing approach that you believe in; people can do both, they can buy-and-hold and time the market side by side in the same portfolio.\par \par \uc2 Not having all of your eggs in one basket certainly makes a lot of sense, no matter which approach you believe in.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jaffe is a writer in Boston.

The acquisition is slated to close during the first quarter of this year, according to a news release.\par \par \uc2 DFW Capital Partners\uc2 , the Teaneck, N.J., private-equity firm which has backed \uc2 Information Innovators\uc2  since 2012, will exit the company through the deal.\par \par \uc2 Bridge Growth Partners\uc2  and \uc2 Frontenac Co\uc2 .-backed Salient CRGT was formed by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0120150810eb8askdp8"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 2015 cashless merger }}}\uc2 of \uc2 CRGT Inc\uc2 ., which Bridge Growth purchased in 2014, and \uc2 Salient Federal Solutions Inc\uc2 ., which was formed with backing from Frontenac in 2009. The transaction for \uc2 Information Innovators\uc2  will be the combined entity's first acquisition since its merger.\par \par \uc2 Salient CRGT provides agile software development, cybersecurity, data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other IT services to government agencies such as the Defense Technology Security Administration, \uc2 U.S. Postal Service\uc2 , U.S. Air Force and \uc2 U.S. Social Security Administration\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Alok Singh\uc2 , a co-founder and managing principal at Bridge Growth, said Salient GRGT was attracted to \uc2 Information Innovators\uc2  because of its desire to expand the company's foothold in the health-care space. Mr. Singh added that with the recent governmental hiring freeze, it is likely more work will be driven to contractors, making outsourced IT providers more relevant.\par \par \uc2 "We think the sector will continue to do very well over the next several years," Mr. Singh said. "Especially with all the houses [of Congress] and the president under the same party, budget processes should be much smoother."\par \par \uc2 The newly acquired company holds contracts with a number of government agencies, including the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  and the \uc2 Department of Veterans Affairs\uc2 , among others, according to the release.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Singh said Salient CRGT's revenue is expected to grow to more than $500 million after the \uc2 Information Innovators\uc2  acquisition closes, compared with $150 million when Bridge Growth first backed the company.\par \par \uc2 New York-based Bridge Growth backs companies in the technology and technology-enabled financial services sectors.\par \par \uc2 Frontenac, of Chicago, targets transactions in the food, services and industrial sectors.\par \par \uc2 DFW Partners invests in companies with less than $10 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization within the health-care services, industrial services and business services sectors, according to the firm's website.\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170206ed26003oi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The terms we use when talking about machine intelligence are inextricably tied to human intelligence.\par \par \uc2 The past year brought a steady drumbeat of technology companies acquiring \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  startups while venture capital poured into the sector. From autonomous vehicles to voice assistants, much of today's conversation surrounding machine intelligence centers on how computing power could replace human brain power.\par \par \uc2 As startups use analogies about the human mind to explain leaps they have made in artificially intelligent models, scientists are realizing they still have much to learn about how the human brain works. That issue came into focus at a \uc2 Bloomberg Beta\uc2  San Francisco gathering last week that included experts from the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  and \uc2 University of California, Berkeley\uc2 , as they explored the link between neuroscience and machine intelligence.\par \par \uc2 It was an important reminder that \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  today works best in applied use cases. Despite the way some talk about the promise of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , machines can't actually operate like a human mind. They do perform some tasks much more effectively than people can, when dealing with hefty data sets and calculations. But they can't replicate certain other cases, such as tasks requiring creativity.\par \par \uc2 Computers are as far from replicating the exact processes of our brains as scientists are from understanding exactly how those processes occur.\par \par \uc2 The winners in the machine-intelligence boom will be companies that apply advanced models to specific problems where vast data sets are available. Artificial general intelligence remains a concept that is only realized in the pages of science fiction.\par \par \uc2 Shivon Zilis, a \uc2 Bloomberg Beta\uc2  partner who invests in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , says AI-based startups can help humans make better decisions, rather than make decisions for them.\par \par \uc2 "Machine intelligence wins on speed, memory, and large scale pattern recognition," she said. "Human intelligence wins on contextualization, creativity, and decision making."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Zilis said the companies her firm has invested in, like Mavrx and ShieldAI, are working on producing "better inputs" that can be more "consumable" for human decision makers.\par \par \uc2 "I honestly view a lot of these technologies as ways to extend my mind," she said. "At the end of the day, I'm still not letting any of these systems make critical decisions on their own, but they do help me make better decisions."\par \par \uc2 Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Blair Hull believes that investors owe it to themselves to do some market timing -- if they do it analytically, not emotionally, and don't do too much of it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hull is founder of Hull Tactical Asset Allocation in Chicago, which runs the $95 million \uc2 Hull Tactical US ETF\uc2  (HTUS). He made a living at blackjack, spending the early 1970s as a card counter (the art of expertly tracking the cards that have been dealt).\par \par \uc2 As a trader, Mr. Hull always wanted to take a similar approach -- basing his moves more on a system than a hunch. His fund plays the S&P 500 index the way Mr. Hull played blackjack, using data to time each move.\par \par \uc2 He spoke with The Wall Street Journal about why market timing makes more sense in the 21st century than before, and how it should fit into an investor's portfolio.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: You say there are similarities between market timing and counting cards. How do they give the investor an edge?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: You have 10 different indicators in a deck of cards: You have 2 through 9, and you have 10s [including face cards] and aces. That's a total of 10 numbers.\par \par \uc2 And we have 10 indicators -- or something like that, it can be a few more or less depending on the model -- for our trading programs. How do we count them? We do it with science, looking at the various indicators, which show when there is a time to be in or out of the market.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: How big of an edge can you create?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: I played blackjack for five years from 1971-75, getting an advantage of, at best, 51-49 [wins to losses]. If we can get a slight advantage in the market, say 55-45, and we sustain that over a long period, we will have the odds in our favor and will actually gain more wealth than if we just went buy-and-hold. I think that's possible.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Your system is all about removing emotion from the market, yet one indicator you rely on in some models is \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Isn't that injecting emotion?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: We're not making emotional decisions about \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , or any of the other indicators used in any of our models. We read the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feed, and we look at the sentiment that occurs on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , people tweeting about the S&P 500 and whether they are bullish or bearish. If they are bullish for a certain amount of time, it's time to sell the market; if they're bearish for a certain amount of time, it's a signal to buy.\par \par \uc2 If the sentiment is sustained long enough, it becomes meaningful and we factor it in with the other indicators; there's nothing emotional about that.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Why have you changed your mind about buy-and-hold investing?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: I haven't. It's still right for most people and most of their money. Timing is very hard. Jack Bogle [founder of \uc2 Vanguard Group\uc2 ] was correct when he said that, in the last century, buy-and-hold was the best strategy, but since 2000 we have had this explosion of data, and along with that explosion has come predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques that we really didn't have before. Right now, you have very few academic papers saying you can't time the market. Right now, they all say it's possible, and they have a vast number of ways people are trying to do it.\par \par \uc2 A lot of those approaches aren't going to work -- they are too susceptible to fear and greed and are run by emotions -- but I think it's possible to have a systematic approach that gives you better returns for less risk.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Despite that belief, you don't believe in putting most of your money at risk through market timing, do you?\par \par \uc2 MR. HULL: The strategy fits in the alternative-investment area -- essentially, it's hedge-fund performance at retail prices -- but alternative strategies should be 5% or 10% of the typical investor's portfolio. People can do both, they can buy-and-hold and time the market. Not having all of your eggs in one basket certainly makes a lot of sense, no matter which approach you believe in.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jaffe is a writer in Boston.

\par\par \uc2 FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY\par {\*\bkmkstart toc75}{\*\bkmkend toc75}\b \uc2 Robot apps aim to help you save more; SAVINGS\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aime Williams \par \uc2 699 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 February 2017\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 03\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Digital developments put security concerns in the spotlight\par \par \uc2 The promise of hyper-smart robot traders has long attracted fund managers to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  - but a flurry of new apps is now bringing AI to savers.\par \par \uc2 Plum, launched in January, and Chip, which began operations late last year, offer ordinary savers the ability to have their savings managed by an algorithm.\par \par \uc2 The apps require access to users' bank statements, which they analyse to identify how much they could afford to put away each month. The algorithm attempts to learn users' spending patterns, including when they pay regular bills and when they might be more likely to splurge on dinner and drinks. If the account holder spends less than usual, the app siphons off small amounts of money from their usual current account into a savings account - in both cases hosted by \uc2 Barclays\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Simon Rabin, co-founder of Chip, says the idea for his app came about after he and co-founder Alex Latham realised that recent graduates were not saving. A recent graduate himself, Mr Latham found himself "perpetually in his overdraft and having bought a holiday on a credit card", while paying \u163\'00\'A3850 a month to rent a flat in Balham, south London.\par \par \uc2 Chip's founders designed it to serve a generation that does not budget in the way its parents did. "Our parents planned more and had more rigid expenses," said Mr Rabin.\par \par \uc2 "At the beginning of the month it was about the mortgage and there was an allocated amount for food and costs for the kids," he said. "Nowadays it's more fluid. I'm not doing a monthly shop, I'm popping into Tesco Express on the way home."\par \par \uc2 Mr Rabin said millennials' spending is "more erratic and fluid". "For us to save effectively, we need to be able to save the same way," he added.\par \par \uc2 Plum, a rival app, operates through Facebook Messenger. This means anyone wanting to use the app must first download the messaging app to their phone before communicating with Plum through one of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's "bots" - human-like characters that can converse with users.\par \par \uc2 Plum's founder, Victor Trokoudes, said the app's goal was to save money "in the most painless possible way".\par \par \uc2 "Rather than pulling money out once a month we try to save regularly between five to seven times a month, the whole idea being you're not feeling the fact that money came out as much as if it had all come out in one go," he said. "It's small, negligible."\par \par \uc2 The apps echo a similar app, Digit, currently only available to US investors and backed by a series of venture capital funds, including GV (formerly known as \uc2 Google Ventures\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Warren Mead, global head of financial technology for consultancy \uc2 KPMG\uc2 , said using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  for saving and investing was "definitely the direction of travel". "I would expect to see more and more developments like this in retail savings," he said.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Power\uc2 , partner at Deloitte, agreed that while AI is already used by fund managers looking to generate investment strategies, it will quickly "roll out more broadly" to general savers and investors.\par \par \uc2 "AI is good at trend and pattern recognition, so one application is to monitor spending and how much you can save."\par \par \uc2 Mr Power suggested that AI could go further than analysing people's bank statements and in future could be used to help investors make better investment decisions.\par \par \uc2 "There's a wealth of research on mistakes people make around loss aversion and things like that," said Mr Power. "Because AI can process data quickly it can highlight to people that actions they're taking are not in their best interests."\par \par \uc2 Banks are under increasing pressure to share data with digital services as well as with comparison websites which could alert users to better deals. However, senior bankers have argued that digital developments could put customer data at risk of being stolen. Some 85 per cent of 300 bank managers surveyed by consultancy \uc2 Accenture\uc2  said that new digital products and services are putting data-handling concerns in the spotlight.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170204ed240001u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Nasdaq Inc\uc2 . named \uc2 Adena Friedman\uc2  as its next chief executive in November, she won attention for being young, tech-savvy and the first woman to lead a major U.S. stock-exchange operator. Now, the hard part has begun.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman, a 47-year-old black belt in taekwondo, has inherited a company whose traditional core business of U.S. stock trading has gotten much tougher since the heady 1990s when \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  touted itself as "the stock market for the next 100 years."\par \par \uc2 Regulations in the late 1990s and the last decade brought competition to exchanges, opening the door to high-tech upstarts like \uc2 Bats Global Markets Inc\uc2 ., which surpassed \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  as the second-biggest U.S. exchange group by volume in 2014, and dozens of dark pools, or private trading venues. Two major market crashes in the last decade soured many investors on stocks altogether.\par \par \uc2 Analysts link a recent slide in \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's share of U.S. stock volume to a broad shift in trading toward securities listed on the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2  and its sister exchanges, including NYSE Arca, which specializes in exchange-traded funds.\par \par \uc2 Adding to Ms. Friedman's challenges, \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  faces fierce competition from its historic rival \uc2 NYSE\uc2  for listings, even in the realm of hot tech stocks in which \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  was once king. This week, the Big Board won the coveted initial public offering of \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 ., owner of the popular messaging app Snapchat.\par \par \uc2 To keep \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  expanding, Ms. Friedman plans to keep pursuing a strategy, initiated under her predecessor, \uc2 Robert Greifeld\uc2 , of diversifying away from the stocks business into financial technology.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman is perhaps most excited about the potential of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  uses AI in systems designed to spot wrongdoing at banks and tools that seek to enhance hedge funds' stock-trading strategies. Such efforts account for a tiny slice of \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's sales today, but Ms. Friedman sees huge potential in AI.\par \par \uc2 "We think in the next decade it could really transform the business," said Ms. Friedman, who became CEO on Jan. 1.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  is pursuing initiatives to draw more trading back to its stock exchanges, which Ms. Friedman describes as a "long game." The company is also building its ETF business. More than 50 exchange-traded products switched from \uc2 NYSE\uc2  to \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  last year, even though NYSE Arca remains the dominant player.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman grew up steeped in finance. Her father, David Testa, was a longtime employee of \uc2 T. Rowe Price Group Inc\uc2 . who rose to the position of chief investment officer before retiring. As a child, Ms. Friedman recalls visiting the T. Rowe trading floor in Baltimore and doodling on the whiteboards with a marker. Both she and her brother -- now a hedge-fund manager -- took up careers in financial services.\par \par \uc2 "It was a big part of what attracted me to the industry," Ms. Friedman said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman joined \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  after finishing business school at \uc2 Vanderbilt University\uc2 . From 1993 to 2011, she held job titles including head of data products, head of strategy and chief financial officer, and sometimes played second base on a company softball team.\par \par \uc2 She was a key player in the 2005 acquisition of \uc2 Instinet Group Inc\uc2 .'s computerized trading division, a deal aimed at shoring up \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's trading technology. While Mr. Greifeld shaped the vision for the deal, Ms. Friedman was one of his top lieutenants in implementing it and worked many late nights to make it happen, recalled John Jacobs, a former \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  executive.\par \par \uc2 Despite the pressure on Ms. Friedman, "I never saw her lose her cool," said Mr. Jacobs, who is now a fellow at \uc2 Georgetown University\uc2 's business school.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, Ms. Friedman left \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  to become CFO of private-equity powerhouse \uc2 Carlyle Group LP\uc2 . The move surprised many, not least because she was seen as a potential successor to Mr. Greifeld.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman said she left because Carlyle offered her an "amazing opportunity" and she wanted to spend more time with her husband and two sons in Washington, D.C., where the buyout firm is based, instead of commuting to New York. She spent three years at Carlyle before returning to \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  as president in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Former colleagues describe Ms. Friedman as hardworking, intelligent and a gifted communicator. When she joined Carlyle, the firm was moving toward becoming a public company. This pushed Ms. Friedman, as CFO, into the crucial role of explaining Carlyle's complicated financials to prospective investors.\par \par \uc2 Her performance during the roadshow before Carlyle's 2012 IPO impressed \uc2 David Rubenstein\uc2 , co-founder and co-CEO of the firm. "She's a star," Mr. Rubenstein said in an interview. "She knew the numbers inside out and upside down."\par \par \uc2 So far, Ms. Friedman's early moves as CEO at \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  -- including a decision to exit its struggling European interest-rate futures business, announced Tuesday -- have been welcomed by Wall Street analysts.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say Ms. Friedman is well positioned to oversee \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's tech-centric strategy, citing her previous leadership of the firm's data and technology businesses. "She's been very involved in some of the newer, cutting-edge initiatives," said \uc2 Richard Repetto\uc2 , an analyst at \uc2 Sandler O'Neill + Partners\uc2  LP.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman is betting that the tech focus will pay off. "We are more than an exchange company today," she said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20170204000050"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170204ed240001a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Nasdaq Inc\uc2 . named \uc2 Adena Friedman\uc2  as its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaq-names-adena-friedman-next-ceo-robert-greifeld-will-be-chairman-1479159822"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 next chief executive}}}\uc2  in November, she won attention for being young, tech-savvy and the first woman to lead a major U.S. stock-exchange operator. Now, the hard part has begun.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman, a 47-year-old black belt in taekwondo, has inherited a company whose traditional core business of U.S. equities trading has gotten much tougher since the heady 1990s when \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  touted itself as "the stock market for the next 100 years."\par \par \uc2 Regulations in the late 1990s and 2000s brought competition to exchanges, opening the door to high-tech upstarts like \uc2 Bats Global Markets Inc\uc2 ., which surpassed \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  as the second-biggest U.S. exchange group by volume in 2014, and dozens of dark pools. Two major market crashes in the 2000s soured many investors on stocks altogether.\par \par \uc2 Analysts link a recent slide in \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's share of U.S. equities volume to a broad shift in trading toward securities listed on the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2  and its sister exchanges, including NYSE Arca, which specializes in exchange-traded funds.\par \par \uc2 Adding to Ms. Friedman's challenges, \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  faces fierce competition from its historic rival \uc2 NYSE\uc2  for listings\u8212\'20\'14even in the realm of hot tech stocks where \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  was once king. Earlier this week the Big Board {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/snap-plans-to-list-shares-on-the-nyse-1485791561"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 won the coveted initial public offering}}}\uc2  of \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 ., owner of the popular messaging app Snapchat.\par \par \uc2 To keep \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  growing, Ms. Friedman plans to keep pursuing a strategy, initiated under her predecessor \uc2 Robert Greifeld\uc2 , of diversifying away from the stocks business into financial technology.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman is perhaps most excited about the potential of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  uses AI in systems designed to spot wrongdoing at banks and tools that seek to enhance hedge funds' stock-trading strategies. Such efforts account for a tiny slice of \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's sales today, but Ms. Friedman sees huge potential in AI.\par \par \uc2 "We think in the next decade it could really transform the business," said Ms. Friedman, who became CEO on Jan. 1.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  is pursuing initiatives to draw more trading back to its stock exchanges, which Ms. Friedman describes as a "long game." The company is also building its ETF business. More than 50 exchange-traded products switched from \uc2 NYSE\uc2  to \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  last year, even though {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/12/28/more-etfs-defecting-from-nyse-in-coming-days/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 NYSE Arca remains the dominant player}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman grew up steeped in finance. Her father, David Testa, was a longtime employee of \uc2 T. Rowe Price Group Inc\uc2 . who rose to the position of chief investment officer before retiring. As a child, Ms. Friedman recalls visiting the T. Rowe trading floor in Baltimore and doodling on the whiteboards with a marker. Both she and her brother\u8212\'20\'14now a hedge-fund manager\u8212\'20\'14took up careers in financial services.\par \par \uc2 "It was a big part of what attracted me to the industry," Ms. Friedman said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman joined \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  after finishing business school at \uc2 Vanderbilt University\uc2 . From 1993 to 2011, she held job titles including head of data products, head of strategy and chief financial officer, and sometimes played second base on a company softball team.\par \par \uc2 She was a key player in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111418938239214619"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 2005 acquisition of Instinet Group Inc.'s}}}\uc2  computerized trading division, a deal aimed at shoring up \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's trading technology. While Mr. Greifeld shaped the vision for the deal, Ms. Friedman was one of his top lieutenants in implementing it and worked many late nights to make it happen, recalled John Jacobs, a former \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  executive.\par \par \uc2 Despite the pressure on Ms. Friedman, "I never saw her lose her cool," said Mr. Jacobs, who is now a fellow at \uc2 Georgetown University\uc2 's business school.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, Ms. Friedman left \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  to become CFO of the private-equity powerhouse \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2 . The move surprised many\u8212\'20\'14not least because she was seen as a potential successor to Mr. Greifeld.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman said she left because Carlyle offered her an "amazing opportunity" and she wanted to spend more time with her husband and two sons in Washington, D.C., where the buyout firm is based, instead of commuting to New York. She spent three years at Carlyle{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaq-hires-friedman-as-co-president-likely-front-runner-to-be-next-ceo-1399867283"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  before returning to Nasdaq as president in 2014}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Former colleagues describe Ms. Friedman as hardworking, intelligent and a gifted communicator. When she joined Carlyle, the firm was moving toward becoming a public company. This pushed Ms. Friedman, as CFO, into the crucial role of explaining Carlyle's complicated financials to prospective investors.\par \par \uc2 Her performance during the roadshow before Carlyle's 2012 IPO impressed \uc2 David Rubenstein\uc2 , co-founder and co-CEO of the firm. "She's a star," Mr. Rubenstein said in an interview. "She knew the numbers inside out and upside down."\par \par \uc2 So far, Ms. Friedman's early moves as CEO at \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14including a decision to exit its struggling European interest-rate futures business, announced Tuesday\u8212\'20\'14have been welcomed by Wall Street analysts.\par \par \uc2 But the hard-charging Mr. Greifeld, now chairman, is a hard act to follow. During his nearly 14-year tenure as CEO, he fought to keep \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  a formidable competitor of \uc2 NYSE\uc2  and spearheaded a multibillion-dollar deal to take over Nordic stock-market operator OMX AB in 2008. \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's revenues reached $3.7 billion last year, compared with $590 million in 2003, the year Mr. Greifeld became CEO.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say Ms. Friedman is well positioned to oversee \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's tech-centric strategy going forward, citing her previous leadership of the firm's data and technology businesses.\par \par \uc2 "She's been very involved in some of the newer, cutting-edge initiatives," said \uc2 Richard Repetto\uc2 , an analyst at \uc2 Sandler O'Neill + Partners\uc2  LP.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Friedman is betting that the tech focus will pay off. "We are more than an exchange company today," she said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Alexander Osipovich at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Bio Box\par \par \uc2 ADENA FRIEDMAN\par \par \uc2 * 47 years old\par \par \uc2 * Married with two sons\par \par \uc2 Professional history\par \par \uc2 * 1993-2011: \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 , various positions\par \par \uc2 * 2011-2014: \uc2 The Carlyle Group\uc2 , chief financial officer\par \par \uc2 * 2014-2016: \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 , president and (from December 2015) chief operating officer\par \par \uc2 * Jan. 1, 2017-present: \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 , president and chief executive\par \par \uc2 Education\par \par \uc2 * 1987-1991: \uc2 Williams College\uc2 , BA in political science\par \par \uc2 * 1991-1993: \uc2 Vanderbilt University\uc2 , MBA\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170203ed23002s5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In the race for customers in Asia's fast-growing ride-hailing market, \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . is facing a new challenge: local rivals that have expanded their offerings to include mobile-payment tools and other on-demand services.\par \par \uc2 After exiting from China following a costly battle for passengers last year, the world's most valuable startup has doubled down on its expansion in India and Southeast Asia, expanding its array of services to include carpooling and motorcycle hailing.\par \par \uc2 Uber's competitors, however, are upping the ante, hoping to create new revenue streams by converting their tech-friendly customers into users of added offerings such as mobile wallets.\par \par \uc2 Ola, owned by ANI Technologies Pvt., allows customers to pay for meals and utility bills using money loaded on its mobile-wallet app, Ola Money.\par \par \uc2 Users of Go-Jek, a ride-hailing app valued at $1 billion and backed by private-equity firms \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Warburg Pincus LLC\uc2 , can request other on-demand services such as manicures and home cleaning through the app. PT Go-Jek Indonesia, which launched its mobile app in January 2015, now offers 15 services beyond ride-hailing including its mobile wallet, Go-Pay. The Jakarta-based company plans to introduce five more offerings this year, but declined to provide specifics.\par \par \uc2 Southeast Asia is a potentially lucrative battleground with its ride-hailing market forecast to grow 18% annually to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion in 2015, according to a report by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and Singapore state investment firm \uc2 Temasek Holdings Pvt. Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 By contrast, growth in the U.S. market is already slowing. Research firm \uc2 eMarketer\uc2  predicts that the number of people who use a ride-hailing service in the U.S. will rise 7.2% in 2018, compared with an estimated 13% gain this year.\par \par \uc2 While expanding in Southeast Asia and India, Uber has traditionally mimicked steps taken by local rivals, introducing services such as motorcycle hailing after competitors began offering them. Low credit-card use in the region drove Uber to enable cash payments for its rides in India starting in May 2015 and in Southeast Asia three months later, said Andrew MacDonald, regional manager of Uber's Asia-Pacific and Latin America operations.\par \par \uc2 Uber set up a foreign investment company in Indonesia and bolstered its offerings by adding a two-wheeler hailing service called UberMoto and chauffeur-driven rental cars in Bali.\par \par \uc2 Mr. MacDonald said the company has no plans to launch a mobile-wallet service, preferring to team up with existing mobile-payment service providers such as \uc2 One97 Communications Ltd\uc2 .'s Paytm in India. The U.S. company operates UberEats, a prepared-food delivery service, in about 60 cities globally, including six in Asia. It also offers package-delivery services in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Go-Jek user \uc2 Novisia\uc2 , a 34-year-old supervisor at a clothing store in Jakarta who like many Indonesians goes by one name, is embracing the company's expanded app, having initially downloaded it to hail a two-wheeler. She now uses Go-Jek's food- and package-delivery services.\par \par \uc2 "We've noticed that when a user uses more than one product, the retention numbers jump exponentially," said Go-Jek Chief Executive Nadiem Makarim. The company tripled its transactions to 35 million in December from a year earlier, he said.\par \par \uc2 Singapore-based ride-hailing startup \uc2 GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd\uc2 ., valued at $3 billion and co-founded by Malaysian \uc2 Anthony Tan\uc2 , has introduced more ways for consumers to load money on its GrabPay mobile-wallet app, including at convenience stores. The mobile wallet can be used to pay for Grab services in Singapore and Indonesia, and will soon be launched in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, tapping mall operators as partners.\par \par \uc2 "That's going to be our big, big push," Mr. Tan said.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Grab said that it planned to invest $700 million in Indonesia over the next four years. The money will be used for a research center in Jakarta and a $100 million investment fund to put money into local financial-technology companies.\par \par \uc2 In India, Ola, which is backed by \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . of Japan, is expanding Ola Money, which can be used at over 500 brick-and-mortar and online merchants. The Bangalore-based company also offers its riders e-commerce and video-on-demand services, as well free in-car Wi-Fi.\par \par \uc2 It isn't clear whether the companies generate any profits from these additional services. Ola, Grab and Go-Jek don't disclose numbers of daily active users, transaction numbers or the amount of revenue they earn.\par \par \uc2 In terms of regional downloads, Grab and Go-Jek are ahead of Uber, according to San Francisco-based mobile-apps \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Sensor Tower. In the fourth quarter, Grab's app was downloaded 6.7 million times in Southeast Asia's six largest markets where it competes with Uber, compared with the U.S. company's 5.3 million downloads. In Indonesia, Go-Jek had 147,000 more downloads than Uber in the same period.\par \par \uc2 India was a sweet spot for Uber, however, registering 8.8 million downloads, more than Ola's 5.3 million, according to Sensor Tower.\par \par \uc2 Diversifying into new services will require hefty investments in recruitment and training with no guarantee that these businesses will ever turn a profit, said Rushabh Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at Canalys.\par \par \uc2 But for Fitrie Ratnasari, 26, who is an account manager in Jakarta and likes to try different apps, the new services, promotions and discounts have helped her choose her preferred ride-hailing app.\par \par \uc2 "Go-Jek first, Grab second, then Uber, in that order," Ms. Ratnasari said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Greg Bensinger in San Francisco contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20170202000088"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170202ed2300025\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In the race for customers in Asia's fast-growing ride-hailing market, \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . is facing a new challenge: local rivals that have expanded their offerings to include mobile-payment tools and other on-demand services.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 After exiting from China }}}\uc2  following a costly battle for passengers last year, the world's most valuable startup {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-drive-into-india-relies-on-raw-recruits-1482402603"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 has doubled down on its expansion }}}\uc2  in India and Southeast Asia, expanding its array of services to include carpooling and motorcycle hailing.\par \par \uc2 Uber's competitors, however, are upping the ante, hoping to create new revenue streams by converting their tech-friendly customers into users of added offerings such as mobile wallets.\par \par \uc2 Ola, owned by ANI Technologies Pvt., allows customers to pay for meals and utility bills using money loaded on its mobile-wallet app, Ola Money.\par \par \uc2 Users of Go-Jek, a ride-hailing app valued at roughly $1 billion and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kkr-warburg-pincus-invest-in-indonesia-motorcycle-hailing-app-go-jek-1470302991"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 backed by private-equity firms KKR & Co. and Warburg Pincus LLC }}}\uc2 , can request other on-demand services such as manicures and home cleaning through the app. PT Go-Jek Indonesia, which launched its mobile app in January 2015, now offers 15 services beyond ride-hailing including its mobile wallet, Go-Pay. The Jakarta-based company plans to introduce five more offerings this year, but declined to provide specifics.\par \par \uc2 Southeast Asia is a potentially lucrative battleground with its ride-hailing market forecast to grow 18% annually to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion in 2015, according to a report by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and Singapore state investment firm \uc2 Temasek Holdings Pvt. Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 By contrast, growth in the U.S. market is already slowing. Research firm \uc2 eMarketer\uc2  predicts that the number of people who use a ride-hailing service in the U.S. will rise 7.2% in 2018, compared with an estimated 13% gain this year.\par \par \uc2 While expanding in Southeast Asia and India, Uber has traditionally mimicked steps taken by local rivals, introducing services such as motorcycle hailing after competitors began offering them. Low credit-card use in the region drove Uber to enable cash payments for its rides in India starting in May 2015 and in Southeast Asia three months later, said Andrew MacDonald, regional manager of Uber's Asia-Pacific and Latin America operations.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-wants-to-be-a-technology-company-in-indonesia-1436274375"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Uber set up a foreign investment company }}}\uc2  in Indonesia and bolstered its offerings by adding {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/04/14/uber-brings-motorcycle-hailing-service-to-indonesia/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a two-wheeler hailing servic }}}\uc2 e called UberMoto and chauffeur-driven rental cars in Bali.\par \par \uc2 Mr. MacDonald said the company currently has no plans to launch a mobile-wallet service, preferring to team up with existing mobile-payment service providers such as \uc2 One97 Communications Ltd\uc2 .'s Paytm in India. The U.S. company operates UberEats, a prepared-food delivery service, in about 60 cities globally, including six in Asia. It also offers some package-delivery services in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Go-Jek user \uc2 Novisia\uc2 , a 34-year-old supervisor at a clothing store in Jakarta who like many Indonesians goes by one name, is embracing the company's expanded app, having initially downloaded it to hail a two-wheeler. She now uses Go-Jek's food- and package-delivery services, as well as "Go-Massage" to book a visiting masseuse.\par \par \uc2 "We've noticed that when a user uses more than one product, the retention numbers jump exponentially," said Go-Jek Chief Executive Nadiem Makarim. The company tripled its transactions to 35 million in December from a year earlier, he said.\par \par \uc2 Singapore-based ride-hailing startup \uc2 GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd\uc2 ., valued at $3 billion and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-rival-grab-seizes-lead-in-southeast-asia-1467620502"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 co-founded by Malaysian Anthony Tan  }}}\uc2 , has introduced more ways for consumers to load money on its GrabPay mobile-wallet app, including at convenience stores. The mobile wallet can be used to pay for Grab services in Singapore and Indonesia, and will soon be launched in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, tapping mall operators as partners.\par \par \uc2 "That's going to be our big, big push," Mr. Tan said.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Grab said that it planned to invest $700 million in Indonesia over the next four years. The money will be used for a research center in Jakarta and a $100 million investment fund to put money into local financial-technology companies. It will also spend on broadening the use of GrabPay.\par \par \uc2 In India, Ola, which is backed by \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 . of Japan, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ola-valued-at-5-billion-in-latest-fundraising-round-1442291034"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 is expanding Ola Money }}}\uc2 , which currently can be used at over 500 brick-and-mortar and online merchants. The Bangalore-based company also offers its riders e-commerce and video-on-demand services, as well free in-car Wi-Fi.\par \par \uc2 It isn't clear whether the companies generate any profits from these additional services. Ola, Grab and Go-Jek don't disclose numbers of daily active users, transaction numbers or the amount of revenue they earn.\par \par \uc2 In terms of regional downloads, Grab and Go-Jek are ahead of Uber, according to data from San Francisco-based mobile-apps \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Sensor Tower. In the fourth quarter, Grab's app was downloaded 6.7 million times in Southeast Asia's six largest markets where it competes with Uber, compared with the U.S. company's 5.3 million downloads. In Indonesia, Go-Jek had 147,000 more downloads than Uber in the same period.\par \par \uc2 India was a sweet spot for Uber, however, registering 8.8 million downloads, more than Ola's 5.3 million, according to Sensor Tower.\par \par \uc2 Diversifying into new services will require hefty investments in recruitment and training with no guarantee that these businesses will ever turn a profit, said Rushabh Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at Canalys.\par \par \uc2 But for Fitrie Ratnasari, 26, who is an account manager in Jakarta and likes to try different apps, the new services, promotions and discounts have helped her choose her preferred ride-hailing app.\par \par \uc2 "Go-Jek first, Grab second, then Uber, in that order," Ms. Ratnasari said.\par \par \uc2 Greg Bensinger in San Francisco contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Resty Woro Yuniar at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:restyworo.yuniar@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 restyworo.yuniar@wsj.com }}}\uc2  and Liza Lin at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Liza.Lin@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Liza.Lin@wsj.com }}}\uc2  and Liza Lin at \par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170202ed220030d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

And that could spell trouble for any major Republican legislative agenda, including comprehensive changes to financial regulation.\par \par \uc2 Responding to anger in the streets and concerns over President Donald Trump's cabinet choices, Democrats decided to boycott two consecutive committee votes on the nominees to lead the Treasury Department and the Health and Human Services Department\u8212\'20\'14Steven Mnuchin and Rep. Tom Price, respectively. According to the rules of the Senate Finance Committee, at least one Democrat must be present for such a vote to take place. But on Wednesday morning, the second day of the boycott, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mnuchin-price-nominations-advance-with-no-democrats-present-1485963439"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Republicans chose to suspend the rules }}}\uc2  and send the nominations directly to the full Senate.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers on both sides decried their counterparts' actions as unprecedented.\par \par \uc2 "The Senate Finance Committee has traditionally been able to function in even the most divisive political environments," Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah said after the committee vote. "That all changed yesterday."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee's top Democrat, criticized Republicans for flouting the panel's rules and said his party was simply demanding answers to their questions about the two nominees.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans don't need Democratic votes to approve Mr. Trump's cabinet, since Democrats abolished the filibuster for cabinet nominees back in 2013. But they do need 60 votes to avoid Democratic filibusters of legislation.\par \par \uc2 That means the GOP will need at least eight Democrats to vote for any sweeping changes to financial regulation, a key goal for both congressional Republicans and Mr. Mnuchin. Without the agreement of Senate Democrats, Republicans will have to use the budget process to make changes to the regulatory regime\u8212\'20\'14but their room to maneuver would be badly crimped.\par \par \uc2 Under budget reconciliation rules, only a simple majority in the Senate is required to make changes to regulations that are "scored" by the \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14meaning they have an impact on federal funds. But most regulations, while they may have costs for private entities, don't require congressional appropriations. For example, no federal funds are needed to maintain bank capital requirements or the existing structure of the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  , both of which Republicans would like to change. Any big changes to those regulations or agencies would require Republicans to go through normal legislative channels\u8212\'20\'14and that means they would have to surpass the filibuster threshold of 60 votes in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Even Democrats up for re-election in states that Mr. Trump won may find it not politically advantageous to join Republicans on anything other than small, noncontroversial legislation, given the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-democrats-dig-in-for-fight-1485909946"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 emerging broad opposition among Democratic voters }}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14and Senate leaders\u8212\'20\'14toward cooperating with the Trump administration.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Republicans on the Finance Committee took turns criticizing their Democratic colleagues for their boycott. But \uc2 Sen. Mike Crapo\uc2  of Idaho, who is also the chairman of the Banking Committee, refrained from making a fiery statement, instead expressing mild agreement with fellow Republicans. The affable senior lawmaker may have been attempting to preserve whatever chance at bipartisan cooperation remains\u8212\'20\'14otherwise, he and his colleagues are in for a long and frustrating 115th Congress.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro First: Fintech Startups Want to Save One Key Page of Dodd-Frank\par \par \uc2 By Telis Demos\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump said this week that his administration is going to do a "big number" on the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and dismantle it. A brewing fight between financial startups and banks over one small section of the law shows how rancorous, and complex, this process could prove.\par \par \uc2 The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in July 2010, is 849 pages long and has numerous provisions that have spurred hundreds of rules covering everything from bank regulation to debit- and credit-card fees to derivatives trading. Each of those issues often has passionate supporters and detractors; changes likely will set off renewed lobbying battles, just as happened when the law was initially crafted.\par \par \uc2 Consider Section 1033. While much attention around Dodd-Frank has focused on its proprietary trading provisions or the consumer-protection agency it created, this one-page, 342 word provision has garnered the attention of startup venture-backed companies.\par \par \uc2 Although there is no indication so far that the administration is focused on this little-known section, some are gearing up to fight to protect it. Section 1033 says that banks must "make available to a consumer, upon request\u8230\'20\'26information relating to any transaction, series of transactions, or to the account" and "in an electronic form that can be used by computer applications."\par \par \uc2 Fintech startups argue this language enshrines their right to pull data from customers' bank accounts when the customers give them permission. Companies such as \uc2 Betterment LLC\uc2  , an online investment manager, say that accessing bank-account data helps them make it easier for consumers to use investing apps, borrow money or move dollars between accounts.\par \par \uc2 Banks, on the other hand, say that while they support customers' right to share their account data, there should be certain restrictions as well. These are needed, they add, to protect consumers from third parties accessing more data than is authorized, or to track how data is used.\par \par \uc2 Already, Betterment and a group of well-funded fintech startups have created an industry group, called the Consumer Financial Data Rights group, in hope of protecting Section 1033 and pushing for broad implementation of it. The group, formed in January, said it would work with policy makers to promote "consumer choice and access."\par \par \uc2 Other group members include \uc2 Personal Capital Corp\uc2 ., Affirm Inc., \uc2 Kabbage Inc\uc2  ., Varo Money Inc., and Hello Digit Inc.\par \par \uc2 "We seek to speak with a unified voice to Trump administration on this issue," said Steven Boms, vice president of government affairs at \uc2 Envestnet\uc2 Yodlee\uc2  , a bank-data aggregation provider.\par \par \uc2 SECTION 1033\par \par \uc2 SEC. 1033. CONSUMER RIGHTS TO ACCESS INFORMATION.\par \par \uc2 (a) IN GENERAL.\u8212\'20\'14Subject to rules prescribed by the Bureau, a covered person shall make available to a consumer, upon request, information in the control or possession of the covered person concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from such covered person, including information relating to any transaction, series of transactions, or to the account including costs, charges and usage data. The information shall be made available in an electronic form usable by consumers.\par \par \uc2 (b) EXCEPTIONS.\u8212\'20\'14A covered person may not be required by this section to make available to the consumer\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 (1) any confidential commercial information, including an algorithm used to derive credit scores or other risk scores or predictors;\par \par \uc2 (2) any information collected by the covered person for the purpose of preventing fraud or money laundering, or detecting, or making any report regarding other unlawful or potentially unlawful conduct;\par \par \uc2 (3) any information required to be kept confidential by any other provision of law; or\par \par \uc2 (4) any information that the covered person cannot retrieve in the ordinary course of its business with respect to that information.\par \par \uc2 (c) NO DUTY TO MAINTAIN RECORDS.\u8212\'20\'14Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose any duty on a covered person to maintain or keep any information about a consumer.\par \par \uc2 (d) STANDARDIZED FORMATS FOR DATA.\u8212\'20\'14The Bureau, by rule, shall prescribe standards applicable to covered persons to promote the development and use of standardized formats for information, including through the use of machine readable files, to be made available to consumers under this section.\par \par \uc2 (e) CONSULTATION.\u8212\'20\'14The Bureau shall, when prescribing any rule under this section, consult with the Federal banking agencies and the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  to ensure, to the extent appropriate, that the rules\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 (1) impose substantively similar requirements on covered persons;\par \par \uc2 (2) take into account conditions under which covered persons do business both in the United States and in other countries; and\par \par \uc2 (3) do not require or promote the use of any particular technology in order to develop systems for compliance.\par \par \uc2 Separately, Plaid Technologies Inc., which provides software tools for firms such as Betterment to access bank data, has been collecting signatures in favor of open data access from its customers and plans to present a petition to regulators and lawmakers in the coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 The fintech firms argue they need a provision like Section 1033, on which the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  has been gathering industry input as it considers potential rules, to ensure access for their apps and services. Because they aren't typically set up as banks, they don't have direct access to users' checking and savings accounts.\par \par \uc2 "The most important issue is access to customers' own financial data," said Jon Stein, chief executive of Betterment, in an interview. "Customers have a right to manage their own."\par \par \uc2 But banks haven't been so enamored with the current setup. They warn that handing over online banking passwords to third parties is risky, and that outside services constantly pulling data from bank servers is a technological burden and could destabilize financial networks.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, banks such as \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2  ., \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2  ., and \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2  . at times suspended access for services that were "scraping" data by scanning online banking websites.\par \par \uc2 Upstarts and banks have discussed compromise proposals, such as creating new ways to create anonymous passwords. Some banks also plan to submit comments to the CFPB on data-safety guidelines for sharing.\par \par \uc2 "We know customers love sharing their data, and banks are working hard to make sure they can share their data regardless of whether there's a law or not," said Robert Morgan, vice president for emerging technologies at the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2  , a banking industry group.\par \par \uc2 Banks and fintech companies have managed to reach some accommodations. \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase\uc2  recently struck a deal with \uc2 Intuit Inc\uc2  ., which owns the \uc2 Mint.com\uc2  service, to enable the bank's customers to share data without giving up their password to Mint and other \uc2 Intuit\uc2  services.\par \par \uc2 Fintech firms argue that so long as Section 1033 or something like it remains, both sides have to deal with each other. With Dodd-Frank's future up in the air, though, the dynamics between the two groups could change.\par \par \uc2 (This article is available to Pro Financial Regulation subscribers first, before being published to wsj.com.)\par \par \uc2 Scaramucci's White House Role Now Uncertain\par \par \uc2 By Lisa Beilfuss, Michael C. Bender and Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 SkyBridge Capital\uc2  founder \uc2 Anthony Scaramucci\uc2  , who left his role as one of Wall Street's splashiest showmen in order to work for President Donald Trump, may not serve on the new, bigger stage after all.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scaramucci, who last month prominently promoted Mr. Trump's agenda as his informal representative at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, will "most likely" not take a position in the White House, an official in the Trump administration said Wednesday. The Trump official, who asked not to be identified, didn't give a detailed reason for the fresh doubts over an appointment that had been publicly disclosed by the Trump transition team in mid-January.\par \par \uc2 Despite new hesitation about Mr. Scaramucci inside the White House, it's not clear he intends to step away from the job, a sign that his role is caught up in the infighting that has marked the new administration.\par \par \uc2 "Donald Trump hasn't rescinded the job offer," said a person familiar with Mr. Scaramucci's situation. That person suggested that Mr. Scaramucci's role has stirred opposition from other aides worried about his ties to the first family. "Mr. Scaramucci has a direct relationship with the president and with the president's children," that person said.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Mr. Scaramucci could not be reached for comment Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scaramucci's uncertain future in the administration marks an awkward moment for the man who worked tirelessly to sell Mr. Trump to skeptical mainstream Republicans after he joined his campaign in May.\par \par \uc2 Instead of taking a flashy role within the White House\u8212\'20\'14one that would have involved frequent television appearances and scrumming with business leaders\u8212\'20\'14Mr. Scaramucci may become an ambassador. The White House official said that Mr. Scaramucci has been offered a diplomatic post, but declined to say in which country he could serve.\par \par \uc2 The reason for Mr. Scaramucci's iffy status within the Trump administration wasn't immediately clear. Several major GOP fundraisers close to him said they didn't know what had caused the change.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scaramucci, an affable salesman and former stockbroker dubbed "The Mooch," had been slated to become head of the Trump administration's Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs. Under former President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , the job was held by Valerie Jarrett, a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 To assume the job, Mr. Scaramucci had to divest his sizable stake in Skybridge, a firm that pitches high-cost, hedge-fund investments to wealthy individuals. He quickly assembled a team of advisers for the sale who included Greg Fleming, a former president of Morgan Stanley's wealth and investment management businesses. Days after the White House confirmed Mr. Scaramucci's role in the administration, he struck a deal to sell his interest in \uc2 SkyBridge Capital\uc2  in a deal that valued the firm at around $200 million, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 The buyers included a unit of Chinese conglomerate HNA Capital, an ambitious group that announced $21 billion in overseas acquisitions last year, and comes at a time when hedge-fund returns have lagged a mix of traditional stock and bond investments. The deal gives HNA a foothold in the global asset-management business as China's increasingly wealthy population looks for places to invest.\par \par \uc2 The extravagant hedge-fund conference Mr. Scaramucci launched during the nadir of the 2008 recession has also been flagged for sale or a possible spinoff after he accepted the White House Job. SALT, for SkyBridge Alternatives, is synonymous with Mr. Scaramucci and is known for attracting world leaders and famous athletes to the annual Las Vegas affair.\par \par \uc2 RushCard, \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  Fined Over 2015 Customer Lockout\par \par \uc2 By Yuka Hayashi\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14UniRush LLC and a unit of \uc2 Mastercard International Inc\uc2  . agreed to settle accusations that "preventable failures" caused a 2015 debacle in which tens of thousands of customers lost access to their money stored on prepaid cards, setting off a cascade of unpaid bills and other personal-finance crunches.\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  said Wednesday the two companies are paying about $10 million to customers affected by the temporary lockup of their accounts, triggered by a technical glitch. The companies are also paying a civil penalty of $3 million.\par \par \uc2 UniRush is the parent company of RushCard, a major prepaid-card business founded by hip-hop producer \uc2 Russell Simmons\uc2  . Mastercard Payment Transaction Services, a unit of \uc2 Mastercard International\uc2  , is RushCard's payment processor. The glitch occurred as RushCard was switching to using \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  from another provider.\par \par \uc2 The settlement came two days after \uc2 Green Dot Corp\uc2  ., a leading prepaid-card company, said it reached a deal to buy UniRush for $147 million.\par \par \uc2 The incident caused severe disruptions for customers, many of whom use prepaid cards for basic financial services including direct deposit of paychecks and government benefits as well as making purchases and paying bills. As customers were shut out of their accounts for days, and in some cases for weeks, some took to social media to air their grievances, complaining that they didn't have money to pay for basic necessities or they were hit with late fees on unpaid bills. Many prepaid-card customers are "unbanked" or "underbanked," meaning they have no or limited access to regular banking services such as checking accounts and credit and debit cards.\par \par \uc2 "All of this stemmed from a series of failures that should have been anticipated and prevented," CFPB Director \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2  said on a conference call. These failures, he said, "caused serious problems for the financial lives of many customers."\par \par \uc2 RushCard said it welcomed the settlement with the CFPB but it didn't admit any wrongdoing. "Since the event in 2015, we believe we have fully compensated all of our customers for any inconvenience they may have suffered," a company representative said. The company settled a class-action lawsuit with customers last year that included reimbursement of $20 million. Mr. Simmons described the incident as "the most challenging periods in my professional career" and thanked customers for remaining loyal.\par \par \uc2 "We are pleased to bring this matter to a close, allowing us to further enhance the best practices, policies and procedures for prepaid cards," a Mastercard spokesman said. He added that the company understands "the critical role prepaid cards play in how people manage their money."\par \par \uc2 The RushCard settlement is part of the CFPB's scrutiny of the prepaid-card industry, a segment that has grown rapidly in recent years. The bureau last year finalized a new rule to bring oversight of the sector closer to regulations covering banks.\par \par \uc2 New payment technologies have elevated prepaid cards into popular financial-management tools rivaling bank checking accounts. Nearly 10% of U.S. households used such cards in 2015, according to a study by the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 The CFPB alleged that in October 2015, as RushCard was switching to \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  as payment processor, UniRush failed to transfer all customer accounts to \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  accurately and delayed processing direct deposits for more than 45,000 consumers. It also failed to provide customer service properly to those affected by the lockup.\par \par \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  , according to the CFPB, didn't make sure it was sending accurate information about customers' accounts to UniRush.\par \par \uc2 The RushCard settlement is the latest action in a spree of enforcement activities by the CFPB in recent weeks, a move industry experts attribute to the bureau's desire to get done as much work as possible amid concern that the new Republican administration will move to constrain its authority. Mr. Cordray said in an interview last week at a WSJ Pro Financial Regulation event that the bureau's enforcement work would continue at a "steady and vigorous" pace, and warned some major cases were still in the pipeline.\par \par \uc2 Since the beginning of January, the CFPB made eight announcements of enforcement actions, including a high-profile lawsuit filed against \uc2 Navient Corp\uc2  ., the nation's largest student-loan servicer, for allegedly obstructing repayments from customers. Navient denies the accusations.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: International Regulator Publishes Draft Standards Around Too-Big-To-Fail Clearinghouses\par \par \uc2 By Julia-Ambra Verlaine\par \par \uc2 BRUSSELS\u8212\'20\'14Global financial supervisors are advancing plans to safeguard clearinghouses they consider too-big-to-fail and that could topple the financial system in the case of collapse.\par \par \uc2 The Swiss-based \uc2 Financial Stability Board\uc2  published draft standards Wednesday on how companies such as London-based \uc2 LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd\uc2  . and \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse AG\uc2  's Eurex should plan for default and manage recovery plans, both of which international regulators have found insufficient to date.\par \par \uc2 Clearinghouses, platforms known as central counterparties that stand between buyers and sellers of financial instruments, have come under the gaze of officials and supervisors given their increased role in the financial system after the 2008 crisis.\par \par \uc2 "They have grown substantially over the last years. The failure of a CCP would have a significant impact on financial stability," said Elke K\u246\'00\'F6nig, chairwoman of Europe's \uc2 Single Resolution Board\uc2  , which is in charge of handling Europe's failing banks.\par \par \uc2 Mostly used by banks and investment firms, the clearinghouses ensure that either party in a derivatives transaction gets paid if the other side falters. The \uc2 FSB\uc2  published a note in August calling for public comment from the industry to help develop resolution strategies and plans for winding them down in case of a global financial shock.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's draft guidelines are a first step toward international standards for clearinghouse recovery and resolution plans.\par \par \uc2 Similar to post-crisis rules built to deal with failing banks, the \uc2 FSB\uc2  would like to avoid leaving taxpayers on the hook in case a large clearinghouse were to fail. The \uc2 FSB\uc2  guidance stipulates details around the reimbursement of any temporary government money used to fund a wind-down.\par \par \uc2 Arrangements for the recovery of temporary public funding should be written into the legal framework and the clearinghouse rules, the \uc2 FSB\uc2  said in the paper. The clearinghouses should also have a legal basis to collect cash from both domestic and foreign participants of the clearinghouse in order remove potential cross-border conflicts.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FSB\uc2  guidelines define the role national supervisors and authorities have to play in handling a failing clearinghouse, alongside creditor rights. It also urges to establishment of international, cross-border "crisis" groups to coordinate plans for clearinghouses that are systemically important across multiple jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FSB\uc2 's efforts are complemented by work carried out by the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  , the EU's executive arm, which put forward a legislative proposal in November that would require the clearinghouses to develop frameworks for resolution in a similar vein.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FSB\uc2  is open to consultation and feedback, which will last until March 13 before proceeding with final guidelines.\par \par \uc2 A Revamp at the Fed? Ways Lawmakers Have Sought Central-Bank Change\par \par \uc2 By Kate Davidson\par \par \uc2 House Republicans are hopeful that a Trump White House will be sympathetic to their efforts to revamp the Federal Reserve, including measures to subject the central bank to more congressional scrutiny and limit its discretionary powers.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump hasn't said whether he would support the measures, but his own public remarks and those of some of his economic advisers suggest he is skeptical of the Fed's independence and the job it has done steering the economy.\par \par \uc2 Though the chances of such bills becoming law are higher than they were under the Obama administration, they still would have to get through Congress first. A number of factors could influence whether and when that happens.\par \par \uc2 Central-bank legislation appears to be low on the GOP's priority list, which already includes plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, overhaul the corporate tax code and pass a big infrastructure spending plan. There may be little time left to debate the merits of auditing the Fed's interest-rate decisions or requiring it to follow a rules-based approach to monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 It also hasn't gotten any easier for legislation to make it through Congress.\par \par \uc2 While Fed-related measures have broad Republican support in the House, most bills or amendments still require 60 votes to advance in the Senate, and Republicans control two fewer seats than they did previously\u8212\'20\'1452 compared with 54 in the last Congress. That means supporters of such legislation would need to convince at least eight Senate Democrats and the entire GOP caucus to support their efforts\u8212\'20\'14a heavy lift for such a polarizing issue.\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be hard for them to do a lot of what they want to do anyway," Andy Laperriere, a policy analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro, said of the Republican majority.\par \par \uc2 Recent history has demonstrated, however, there is more than one way to move Fed-related changes through Congress.\par \par \uc2 Twice in 2015, Republicans attached Fed-related provisions to unrelated bills that Democrats weren't willing to vote against, despite the Fed's opposition.\par \par \uc2 A law reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program included a requirement requiring the U.S. president to nominate at least one member to the Fed board with community banking experience. Congress also tapped the Fed's capital surplus account to help pay for new federal highway spending, over strong objections from Fed officials who warned such a move would undermine its independence.\par \par \uc2 Some Republican senators also are considering the possibility of using a special legislative procedure known as budget reconciliation that would allow them to make changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law with just a simple majority, rather than a 60-vote super majority. It isn't clear whether such changes would include provisions related to the Fed's monetary policy operations.\par \par \uc2 Finally, there could be room for some bipartisan compromise on changes to the Fed, such as limiting its emergency lending powers. But that depends greatly on whether those provisions are included in a broader package to overhaul the Dodd-Frank law, which may not win much Democratic support.\par \par \uc2 Some senior Fed officials think the central bank should pursue changes on its own that would satisfy Republicans' calls for more public information about its deliberations, such as releasing transcripts of its policy meetings sooner than the current five-year lag, or putting more information in its reports to Congress about which rules it has consulted in its interest-rate decisions.\par \par \uc2 What measures may come up now that Mr. Trump is in the White House? Here are the major legislative proposals that Republicans\u8212\'20\'14and a few Democrats\u8212\'20\'14have tried to advance in recent years. Each measure has be reintroduced in the new Congress, which began in January 2017, to be considered.\par \par \uc2 Audit the Fed\par \par \uc2 What is it: Legislation to require the \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  to audit the Fed's monetary policy decisions. The Fed's financial statements are already audited, and the GAO can examine most other Fed operations, but Congress has long exempted monetary policy decisions from its purview.\par \par \uc2 Who supports it: Former Rep. Ron Paul had been pushing a version of this legislation for years before his son \uc2 Sen. Rand Paul\uc2  (R., Ky.) joined the Senate and took up the cause. It has gained support since the financial crisis among Republicans unhappy with the Fed's actions and its role in the economy.\par \par \uc2 Where it stands: \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  and Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) reintroduced measures in the Senate and House, respectively, in January. The Senate blocked the bill in early 2016 on a vote of 53-44, short of the 60 votes needed to clear a procedural hurdle. The provision was included in a broader bill that passed the House 241-185 on a party-line vote.\par \par \uc2 What the Fed says: Chairwoman \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  and other officials oppose the measure, warning it could subject the Fed to political pressure on monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 The FORM Act\par \par \uc2 What it is: A main feature of the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act is the so-called Taylor Rule requirement, which would require Fed officials to establish a mathematical formula to guide their interest-rate decisions, and require them to report to Congress if they deviate from the rule. The bill also would allow the GAO to audit the Fed's policy decisions; widen membership of the Fed's rate-setting committee; require the Fed leader to testify four times each year, instead of two; and place new restrictions on the Fed's emergency lending powers; in addition to other provisions related to regulatory policy.\par \par \uc2 Who supports it: The measure was introduced in the last Congress by Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.), the former chairman of the House monetary policy subcommittee, and had 20 Republican co-sponsors.\par \par \uc2 Where it stands: The bill passed the House 241-185 on a party-line vote in the last Congress, but the Senate never voted on it. \uc2 Rep. Jeb Hensarling\uc2  (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has said advancing the bill in the current Congress would be a priority.\par \par \uc2 What the Fed says: Fed officials oppose it. "I believe, and I think most of my colleagues would agree, that we shouldn't mechanically follow that rule or any other rule but that we need to take into account how the economy is performing," Ms. Yellen told the House panel in February.\par \par \uc2 Financial Choice Act\par \par \uc2 What it is: In addition to the changes that would be required under the FORM Act, the bill would require the Fed's spending on activities unrelated to monetary policy to go through the congressional appropriations process; require the Fed to report to Congress on any negotiations or setting of financial standards with international regulators; and establish a "centennial commission" to study the long-term effects of Fed policy on the economy, and make recommendations to Congress for possible changes to Fed operations, transparency or governance.\par \par \uc2 Who supports it: Mr. Hensarling introduced the bill in the last Congress.\par \par \uc2 Where it stands: The \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  approved it, but it never made it to the House floor for a vote last year. It hasn't been reintroduced.\par \par \uc2 What the Fed says: Because the Fed provisions of this bill are nearly identical to the FORM Act, the Fed has many of the same reservations.\par \par \uc2 Bailout Prevention Act\par \par \uc2 What it is: The measure would significantly curtail the Fed's powers to lend to financial firms in an emergency. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law put some restrictions in place, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle aren't satisfied the Fed has taken the necessary steps to implement those restrictions.\par \par \uc2 Who supports it: This measure has bipartisan support. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), one of the Fed's most high-profile critics, introduced a version of the bill in the Senate, and a similar measure was introduced in the House. Republicans and Democrats, including Ms. Warren, signed letters calling on the Fed to toughen up its own rules for lending to banks in an emergency.\par \par \uc2 Where it stands: Lawmakers haven't held hearings on either bill\u8212\'20\'14the first step in the process\u8212\'20\'14but a similar provision was included in the Financial Choice Act, suggesting Republicans are interested in tackling this issue in some way. The measures haven't been reintroduced yet.\par \par \uc2 What the Fed says: Fed officials oppose it. Fed governor \uc2 Jerome Powell\uc2  said in February 2015 that "further restricting or eliminating the Fed's emergency lending authority will not prevent future crises, but it will hinder the Fed's ability to limit the harm from those crises for families and businesses."\par \par \uc2 Fed Capital Stock\par \par \uc2 What is it: The measure would require the Fed to pay back billions of dollars in capital that banks paid to be members of the Fed system. The bill was introduced in 2015 after Congress voted to lower the dividend the Fed pays banks on that capital to help pay for federal highway programs.\par \par \uc2 Who supports it: Former Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer introduced the measure, which has strong backing from the banking industry, but it isn't clear whether it has any support in the Senate or who may reintroduce it in the House.\par \par \uc2 Where it stands: Mr. Neugebauer tried to convince his House colleagues to include the provision in a year-end spending bill in 2015, but it was ultimately left out. He introduced it as a stand-alone bill last year, but it was never taken up by the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 What the Fed says: Fed officials have expressed a variety of concerns about the proposal.\par \par \uc2 Credit Card Fraud Keeps Rising, Despite New Security Chips\u8212\'20\'14Study\par \par \uc2 By AnnaMaria Andriotis and Peter Rudegeair\par \par \uc2 More consumers became victims of identity fraud last year than at any point in more than a decade despite new security protections implemented by the credit-card industry, a report released Wednesday said.\par \par \uc2 Some 15.4 million U.S. consumers were victims of identity fraud in 2016, resulting in $16 billion in total losses, according to the report by consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research and identity-theft-protection firm \uc2 LifeLock Inc\uc2  . The number of victims rose 18% from 2015 and was the highest since Javelin, a unit of \uc2 Greenwich Associates LLC\uc2  , started tracking the phenomenon in 2003.\par \par \uc2 The increase in identity fraud, the bulk of which comes from card activity, was driven in part by a 15% rise in cases of fraudulent online purchases, the study noted. That activity led to "existing-card" fraud, which involves criminals counterfeiting debit and credit cards already held by customers, reaching a new peak.\par \par \uc2 Big increases also occurred in rarer frauds that have been steadily rising in recent years and that are harder for consumers and lenders to detect. The incidence of new-account fraud, for example, in which new accounts are opened in consumers' names without their knowledge or knowledge by the lender, rose 40% to 1.8 million, while the number of cases of consumers having a bank account, credit card or other account taken over improperly increased by over one-fifth to 1.4 million.\par \par \uc2 The increases happened despite the rollout of tougher security measures around debit and credit cards over the past couple of years. Most major card issuers in the U.S. have replaced consumers' magnetic stripe cards with chip cards, and merchants have increasingly shifted to more secure payment terminals, which combined are supposed to make it harder for consumers' card information to be stolen.\par \par \uc2 But the findings of the report suggest that swindlers are finding ways around the new measures. "Fraud is kind of like squeezing Jell-O," said Stephen Coggeshall, chief \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and science officer at \uc2 LifeLock\uc2  . "Stop it one place, and it migrates to somewhere else."\par \par \uc2 With online shopping, there is no way to use the chips on cards. Most of those merchants still rely on the basic card numbers, expiration dates and security codes on the cards. That is largely why "card-not-present" fraud, in which criminals use card information to make transactions online without needing to present the actual card, affected 3.4% of consumers, up from 2.4% in 2015, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 Card networks, including \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2  ., say chip cards have helped bring down the counterfeit fraud rate, in which card data are stolen from merchants and used to create fake cards. Visa also said last month that its fraud rate at online merchants was down 1% in September from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 In response to the persistence of online card fraud, credit-card networks, banks and technology firms are investing in more secure methods of sharing payment details online, such as "tokenization," in which a unique code is generated for each transaction to be approved instead of cardholders' account numbers.\par \par \uc2 MasterCard Inc. Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Martina Hund-Mejean\uc2  said on an earnings call Tuesday that the company is increasing spending in 2017 largely to boost customer and merchant usage of its digital wallet that uses tokenization, known as Masterpass.\par \par \uc2 Separately, the study showed that nearly half of the instances of card fraud involved chip-enabled card accounts that have been used online or at stores that don't yet have chip-enabled terminals. Some 64% of storefront merchants still only accept cards' magnetic stripe, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 While other forms of identity fraud are less common than existing-card fraud, swindlers are exploiting them in part because they take longer to detect. With new-account fraud, total losses reached $3.6 billion, up 24% from 2015, even though less than 1% of consumers were affected.\par \par \uc2 Some 30% of all new-account fraud victims last year had a general-purpose credit card opened in their name, up from 21% in 2015, which often resulted in card issuers giving out chip-enabled cards to swindlers, said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security at Javelin.\par \par \uc2 Separately, total losses associated with a swindler taking over a consumer's account rose nearly two-thirds to $2.3 billion.\par \par \uc2 Still, chip usage has helped bring down the amount of losses on existing card fraud to $961 on average per incident in 2016, down 2% from a year prior and down 30% from 2013.\par \par \uc2 House Passes Resolution to Kill Extractive Anti-Graft Rule\par \par \uc2 By Samuel Rubenfeld\par \par \uc2 The House of Representatives voted to repeal a \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  rule on oil, gas and mining companies that is aimed at preventing corruption.\par \par \uc2 The House passed, on a vote of 235-187, a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act disapproving the rule established by Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires oil, gas and mining companies to annually disclose the payments they make to foreign governments for things such as licenses and permits.\par \par \uc2 The Congressional Review Act, a rarely-applied law, allows legislators to repeal government-agency rules on a majority vote if they were finalized in the last 60 legislative days. The \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  is expected to vote Thursday on the resolution. The SEC rule on oil, gas and mining companies was finalized in June 2016.\par \par \uc2 Activists and observers have said payments to governments for permits can be used to hide bribes, but industry groups have said the rule's compliance requirements are costly and anti-competitive. The hour-long debate on the House floor focused on whether the rule, in fact, prevents corruption, or is an example of regulatory overreach.\par \par \uc2 "Even without this rule in effect \u8230\'20\'26 corruption will still be corruption, and it should be punished with the full extent of the law," said Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.), who had introduced the legislation to remove the rule.\par \par \uc2 "Conducting American foreign policy is not what Congress created the SEC to do," he said.\par \par \uc2 Democratic lawmakers countered, saying the compliance requirements of the rule aren't onerous, and they are merely a way to prevent resource-sector companies from hiding bribes that are illegal under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\par \par \uc2 "That's all we're talking about here\u8211\'20\'13transparency," said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D., N.Y.).\par \par \uc2 The rule is set to go into effect in 2018, but some companies already report such payments under similar rules imposed in Europe and Canada. It has been fought over since the passage of the Dodd-Frank in 2010. The oil industry successfully sued to vacate the first iteration of the rule approved in 2012, but after pressure from non-profits, the SEC rewrote its rule.\par \par \uc2 Activists immediately condemned the House vote, saying it supports corruption.\par \par \uc2 "Voting to roll back basic transparency rules provides zero benefit for the public but will instead allow corrupt elites continue to stuff their pockets with oil money and steal from their citizens," said Isabel Munilla, senior policy adviser for extractive industries at Oxfam America, in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The two authors of the Dodd-Frank provision, former Sen. Richard Lugar and current Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.) had called for the rule to stay in place, saying Tuesday in an op-ed that the provision, when passed, showed U.S. leadership on fighting corruption in the resource sectors, and the argument that the provision is anti-competitive is a red herring because of rules now in effect in 30 countries.\par \par \uc2 "With Europe and Canada in the same disclosure system, the playing field is now level. And the companies already filing have suffered no commercial harm nor revealed vital secrets," they wrote.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  to Pay Lehman Post-Bankruptcy Estate $797.5 Million\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Patrick Fitzgerald\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2  . and the remnants of \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  Wednesday resolved their remaining disputes over the investment bank's 2008 collapse with a deal that will result in the failed investment bank's creditors recovering nearly $800 million.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Lehman said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York that the global settlement "finally resolves the last of [Lehman's] disputes with \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  , its largest secured creditor, and enables creditor distributions of nearly $800 million."\par \par \uc2 In return for the $797.5 million payment, Lehman agreed to drop its objection to \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's $30 billion in so-called Tassimo claims related to losses the bank says it suffered when it was forced to liquidate Lehman's securities following the investment bank's bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  served as Lehman's clearing bank. The bank provided cash advances of up to $100 billion a day to Lehman to facilitate overnight repurchase, or repo, agreements. That role resulted in \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  being one of Lehman's adversaries in numerous disputes surrounding the investment bank's demise as well as one of its largest creditors.\par \par \uc2 When the dust from Lehman's bankruptcy settled, \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  said, some $30 billion it had advanced to Lehman was left unpaid. The bank had filed claims against Lehman's bankruptcy estate for that amount.\par \par \uc2 "We are pleased to have resolved Lehman's remaining claims and to put the matter behind us," said J.P. Morgan spokesman Brian Marchiony. He added the bank had previously reserved for this settlement.\par \par \uc2 A Lehman spokeswoman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  had earlier agreed to pay \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  $1.42 billion in cash to settle most of a 2010 lawsuit over what it called \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's "cash grab" in the weeks before the investment bank's September 2008 collapse.\par \par \uc2 That deal, which a bankruptcy judge approved last year, also put to rest Lehman's challenges over \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's closeout of thousands of derivatives contracts between the two financial firms. A hearing on the latest settlement, which also requires court approval, is set for Feb. 16.\par \par \uc2 Lehman, once the nation's fourth-largest investment bank, collapsed into the largest bankruptcy ever in September 2008, and its U.S. brokerage business was quickly sold off to \uc2 Barclays PLC\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 A team of bankruptcy professionals under the direction of turnaround firm \uc2 Alvarez & Marsal\uc2  managed \uc2 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc\uc2  .'s assets until the holding company's exit from chapter 11 in 2012, when a reorganized company emerged, overseen by a new board.\par \par \uc2 The remains of the holding company, which has returned more than $113 billion to creditors, is expected to exist in some form for several more years as it unwinds its remaining holdings.\par \par \uc2 Bundesbank's Dombret: No Deal on Basel III Better Than Bad Deal\par \par \uc2 By Todd Buell\par \par \uc2 FRANKFURT\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Deutsche Bundesbank\uc2  wants a compromise in protracted negotiations over international banking standards that is good for the country, the German central bank's representative for banking supervision said Thursday. He added, however, that not getting a deal is better than achieving a bad deal.\par \par \uc2 The comments come as international regulators continued to work to iron out a final arrangement over an agreement known as Basel III. The completion of these rules has been held up by a clash between bankers and regulators over how lenders calculate the riskiness of assets and, therefore, the amount of capital they have to hold. Many European banks use "internal models," which U.S. regulators argue have allowed them to underestimate capital needs.\par \par \uc2 Regulators put off a meeting scheduled for January that was supposed to complete a deal. An agreement could potentially come in March.\par \par \uc2 Andreas Dombret\uc2  of the Bundesbank said that his institution is working to ensure that a final deal doesn't mean higher capital requirements. "The motto must thus be: better no deal than a bad deal," he said, according to a speech text prepared for delivery in Berlin.\par \par \uc2 "At the same time, however, it is true that an international standard has great importance which cannot be underestimated," he said. In times in which countries are becoming ever more introverted, this is even more true, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The Bundesbank will continue to work for a compromise on Basel III, a compromise which is good for Germany," he said.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank Posts Loss as Litigation Costs Bite\par \par \uc2 By Jenny Strasburg and William Wilkes\par \par \uc2 FRANKFURT\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2  on Thursday reported a worse-than-expected net loss in the fourth quarter, ending another tumultuous year hurt by litigation costs, client concerns about the lender's stability and economic headwinds that challenged European banks broadly.\par \par \uc2 Germany's biggest lender made a net loss of \u8364\'20\'AC1.9 billion ($2.05 billion) after taking \u8364\'20\'AC1.6 billion in litigation charges in the fourth quarter. That compared with a year-earlier loss of \u8364\'20\'AC2.1 billion in the fourth quarter.\par \par \uc2 Analysts had expected a fourth-quarter net loss of \u8364\'20\'AC1.57 billion, according to consensus figures compiled by \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Its shares were down more than 5% Thursday morning.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  said it was stung late last year by a swirl of speculation about what it might have to pay to settle its biggest overhanging legal issue, related to U.S. probes into toxic mortgage securities. Clients pulled away, denting its global trading operation and other pockets of the bank, which didn't fare as well as competitors' despite spikes in market volatility that pumped up fixed-income trading.\par \par \uc2 That meant that the U.K.'s decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and U.S. election-driven trading didn't benefit \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  as much as it did many others in bond trading and other areas where it is historically strong. Nervous clients also pulled back from trading stocks through \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  , it said Thursday. Asset-management clients have withdrawn some of their business, hurting fees in that unit. The concerns about \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  's financial position last year increased the costs needed to fund its businesses.\par \par \uc2 In December, the lender agreed to pay $7.2 billion to settle the high-profile U.S. mortgage-securities cases in a deal completed last month with the \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  . The $3.1 billion cash portion of that settlement came in below worst-case fears but is still a burden on the lender's thin capital cushion.\par \par \uc2 In total, the bank has in the past two months agreed to pay out around $8 billion to settle some of its biggest long-running legal matters with the U.S. Justice Department and U.K. and New York regulators, but unresolved investigations still concern investors. The lender said Thursday it has set aside \u8364\'20\'AC7.6 billion for litigation. Of that, around \u8364\'20\'AC4.7 billion is earmarked for settlements already reached. Some of the payouts, such as relief to mortgage consumers hurt by the toxic securities, aren't due until next year or after.\par \par \uc2 Quarterly net revenue rose 6% to \u8364\'20\'AC7.1 billion but for the full year was down 10% at \u8364\'20\'AC30 billion. For the full year, \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  's net loss was \u8364\'20\'AC1.4 billion, following a 2015 loss of \u8364\'20\'AC6.8 billion.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  's shares have declined about 30% since Chief Executive \uc2 John Cryan\uc2  and his revamped management board announced a multiyear turnaround plan in October 2015. Their strategy has been to shrink some businesses and sell others, overhaul the lender's technology and compliance systems and cut thousands of employees while trying to preserve the strength of profit engines such as bond trading, deal advising and corporate lending.\par \par \uc2 But some of those key businesses have lost momentum, in part to stronger U.S. banks.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  said its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial health, was 11.9% at the year-end, up from 11.1% at the end of the third quarter. That closely watched figure is subject to increasingly strict regulatory requirements, and \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  's 2018 target is a primary focus of investors' concerns about whether the bank will need to sell shares to raise cash. Mr. Cryan has said he doesn't want to do that and that the bank meets its capital requirements.\par \par \uc2 European banks broadly have been hurt by low and negative interest rates, which eat into lending profit. \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  's challenges are exacerbated by an especially low-margin retail banking industry in Germany, and by the persistent questions surrounding its capital position that have driven away some clients.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  said last month it was slashing bonuses for many senior bankers and other staff, and that its top executives won't get bonuses for a second year. The cost-cutting moves have been cheered by analysts and investors who for years criticized the bank for promising to trim expenses only to disappoint. But morale among \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  employees also has suffered, and competitors have poached some of its senior bankers and traders.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cryan said Thursday that the lender has had "a promising start to this year." The bank's liquidity reserves were \u8364\'20\'AC218 billion at year-end, an increase from \u8364\'20\'AC200 billion at the end of September.\par \par \uc2 The bank cited as accomplishments its lower costs and the wind-down of a unit that housed noncore holdings. The full-time employee head count was slightly more than 98,000 at year-end, compared with 101,000 at the end of 2015.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  's 2016 provisions for credit losses increased to \u8364\'20\'AC1.38 billion, from \u8364\'20\'AC960 million in 2015, chiefly due to its shipping portfolio. Several European banks are wrestling with high exposure to a yearslong global crisis in the shipping sector.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Senators Press Wells Fargo on Branch Reviews Notices\par \par \uc2 Some Democratic senators sent a letter to \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  (WFC) following a WSJ article about the bank giving advance notice of branch reviews and some employees attempting to cover up sham accounts, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by WSJ. Led by Sen. Bob Menendez (D, N.J.), the senators asked WFC CEO \uc2 Timothy Sloan\uc2  15 questions, with a deadline of Feb. 17, about employees who shredded papers and forged signatures to cover up questionable sales practices. Questions ranged from why WFC gave managers a heads up on reviews to the board's awareness of such issues. WFC had no immediate comment but the bank changed the 24-hour notice after being contacted by WSJ and has been adding other procedures around branch checks.

She's spent more than a third of her time with just four key lawmakers: Sen Sherrod Brown (D, Ohio) and Rep Maxine Waters (D, Calif), the top Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee and \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  ; Sen Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass), who bucked her colleague and fellow populist Sen. Bernie Sanders (D, Vt) and opposed a measure to audit the Fed; and Sen Bob Corker (R, Tenn), one of the few Senate Republicans willing to openly support the central bank.

The settlement came two days after Green Dot (GDOT), a rival prepaid-card company, unveiled a plan to acquire UniRush for $147M. UniRush, the program manager of RushCard, founded by hip-hop producer \uc2 Russell Simmons\uc2 , didn't admit any wrongdoing. It is common among companies to settle outstanding regulatory enforcement cases before closing mergers and acquisition deals.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  thinks he can return the economy to 4% annual growth. \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2 , the Federal Reserve chairwoman, is expecting little more than 2%.\par \par \uc2 This looks like a recipe for a collision course. In fact, the dichotomy could help keep the peace between a growth-hungry president and inflation-wary central bank. The reason is that Ms. Yellen will be setting interest rates according to her forecast, not Mr. Trump's, and if her forecast is right, interest rates aren't going very high.\par \par \uc2 The statement {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-leaves-policy-rate-unchanged-offers-no-hint-on-when-it-might-next-move-1485975718"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 released by the Fed on Wednesday}}}\uc2  underlined this point. As expected, the Fed left its benchmark short-term interest rate between 0.5% and 0.75%. More important, it gave no clue it was in a hurry to raise it again. Last December, Fed officials indicated they would raise rates three times this year, and there's no sign they have a higher number in mind.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-rates-for-first-time-in-2016-anticipates-3-increases-in-2017-1481742086"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 As of their last projections}}}\uc2 , in December, they expect just 2.1% economic growth in 2017. Wednesday's statement did note the surge in business and consumer confidence since Mr. Trump was elected in November. But officials are wary of reading too much into confidence readings; they want to see actual behavior follow suit. "It has seen false dawns repeatedly in this expansion," notes \uc2 Krishna Guha\uc2 , a policy analyst at Evercore ISI.\par \par \uc2 Recent readings on purchasing managers' activity are upbeat, as was Wednesday's reading of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-sector-hiring-off-to-strong-start-in-2017-1485956456?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 January private payrolls}}}\uc2  by \uc2 Automatic Data Processing Inc\uc2 . and forecasting firm Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Nonetheless, investors' bets on "Trumpflation" appear to have peaked. The stock market and bond yields have both been range-bound since mid-December. The dollar has weakened. Roberto Perli at Cornerstone Macro infers that markets are expecting a moderate boost to growth from Mr. Trump's fiscal plans this year. My colleague James Mackintosh notes that the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-markets-dont-believe-in-trump-for-the-long-term-1485790384"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 divergent behavior between 10- and 30-year yields}}}\uc2  can be construed the same way. There's no pressure on the Fed from inflation. In recent months, core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) has stabilized {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-inflation-firmed-spending-accelerated-in-december-1485783234"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 just below its 2% target}}}\uc2 , using the Fed's preferred measure.\par \par \uc2 At this point, Fed officials have no firm views on how fiscal policy will unfold. Yet if baseline expectations of only a modest boost to growth prove correct, it's hard to see why the Fed would change its plans or why the markets would sell off. Bond yields have already priced in the Fed's projected path of gradual rate increases.\par \par \uc2 Unlike other recent presidents, Mr. Trump probably feels no compunction about commenting on the independent Fed. If 4% growth eludes him, he may blame Ms. Yellen. Yet if Ms. Yellen tightens as glacially as she now expects, it's difficult to see the economic or market mayhem that would set Mr. Trump off.\par \par \uc2 What if, instead, unemployment falls sharply and growth does start to accelerate? The Fed will, of course, tighten faster. Yet Mr. Trump may be so busy taking credit for the economic boom and soaring stock market, he may not bother to complain.\par \par \uc2 Write to Greg Ip at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:greg.ip@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 greg.ip@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170202ed220038r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 More consumers became victims of identity fraud last year than at any point in more than a decade despite new security protections implemented by the credit-card industry, a report released Wednesday said.\par \par \uc2 Some 15.4 million U.S. consumers were victims of identity fraud in 2016, resulting in $16 billion in total losses, according to the report by consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research and identity-theft-protection firm \uc2 LifeLock Inc\uc2 . The number of victims rose 18% from 2015 and was the highest since Javelin, a unit of \uc2 Greenwich Associates LLC\uc2 , started tracking the phenomenon in 2003.\par \par \uc2 The increase in identity fraud, the bulk of which comes from card activity, was driven in part by a 15% rise in cases of fraudulent online purchases, the study noted. That activity led to "existing-card" fraud, which involves criminals counterfeiting debit and credit cards already held by customers, reaching a new peak.\par \par \uc2 Big increases also occurred in rarer frauds that have been steadily rising in recent years and that are harder for consumers and lenders to detect. The incidence of new-account fraud, for example, in which new accounts are opened in consumers' names without their knowledge or knowledge by the lender, rose 40% to 1.8 million, while the number of cases of consumers having a bank account, credit card or other account taken over improperly increased by over one-fifth to 1.4 million.\par \par \uc2 The increases happened despite the rollout of tougher security measures around debit and credit cards over the past couple of years.\par \par \uc2 Most major card issuers in the U.S. have replaced consumers' magnetic stripe cards with chip cards, and merchants have increasingly shifted to more secure payment terminals, which combined are supposed to make it harder for consumers' card information to be stolen.\par \par \uc2 But the findings of the report suggest that fraudsters are finding ways around the new measures. "Fraud is kind of like squeezing Jell-O," said \uc2 Stephen Coggeshall\uc2 , chief \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and science officer at \uc2 LifeLock\uc2 . "Stop it one place, and it migrates to somewhere else."\par \par \uc2 With online shopping, there is no way to use the chips on cards. Most of those merchants still rely on the basic card numbers, expiration dates and security codes on the cards. That is largely why "card-not-present" fraud, in which criminals use card information to make transactions online without needing to present the actual card, affected 3.4% of consumers, up from 2.4% in 2015, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 Card networks, including \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 ., say chip cards have helped bring down the counterfeit fraud rate, in which card data are stolen from merchants and used to create fake cards. \uc2 Visa\uc2  also said last month that its fraud rate at online merchants was down 1% in September from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 In response to the persistence of online card fraud, credit-card networks, banks and technology firms are investing in more secure methods of sharing payment details online, such as "tokenization," in which a unique code is generated for each transaction to be approved instead of cardholders' account numbers.\par \par \uc2 Mastercard Inc. Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Martina Hund-Mejean\uc2  said on an earnings call Tuesday that the company is increasing spending in 2017 largely to boost customer and merchant usage of its digital wallet that uses tokenization, known as Masterpass.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich508\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal5240\pichgoal10160

Since its founding six years ago it has raced to about $15bn of assets generated, pushing into new products such as\u160\'00\'A0mortgages and personal loans from its roots in student loans.\par \par \uc2 The core product of Zenbanx, which was founded in 2012 by Arkadi Kuhlmann, a former head of ING Direct, is a mobile banking account that lets people save, spend and send money in multiple currencies, both domestically and internationally. Accounts are insured through a partnership with \uc2 WSFS Bank\uc2 , the banking arm of a $6.6bn-in-assets group headquartered in Delaware.\par \par \uc2 Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but a person familiar with the deal said that SoFi would pay Zenbanx\u8217\'20\'19s venture capital backers less than $100m in stock when the deal closes in mid-February. Zenbanx accounts will then be rebranded as SoFi accounts, allowing SoFi to broaden the range of products offered to its 225,000 customers, or \u8220\'20\'1Cmembers\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Kuhlmann is joining SoFi as a member of the executive team, in charge of banking products.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSoFi and Zenbanx share a vision that banking should and can be better, and have built products and services to do it,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Mike Cagney\uc2 , SoFi\u8217\'20\'19s co-founder, chief executive and chairman.\u160\'00\'A0He said SoFi was moving \u8220\'20\'1Ccloser to becoming the centre of our members\u8217\'20\'19 financial lives\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Many online lenders have had a\u160\'00\'A0tough time over the past year, as\u160\'00\'A0choppy credit markets, rising delinquencies and a governance scandal at \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  prompted many loan buyers to put programmes on hold. That, in turn, has caused the groups to cut back on\u160\'00\'A0generating assets, squeezing their bottom lines as revenues falter.\par \par \uc2 Data from Orchard, a technology and data provider, show that volumes across US consumer-loan platforms slipped for a third successive quarter between July and September, dropping 21 per cent to $1.86bn. That was less than half of the peak in the fourth quarter last year.\par \par \uc2 One of SoFi\u8217\'20\'19s big buyers of student loans,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Citizens Financial Group\uc2 , told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  last month that it planned to taper its purchases this year, as it originates more loans of its own. \u8220\'20\'1CIf we\u8217\'20\'19re doing more on our own we need a little less from them,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Bruce van Saun\uc2 , chief executive of the Providence, Rhode Island-based bank.\par \par \uc2 Other online lenders have made efforts to diversify sources of fee income.\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Lending Club\uc2 , the San Francisco-based specialist in supplying personal loans over the web, branched out into car loans in October, while Avant of Chicago signed a deal to supply its underwriting technology to\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Regions Financial Corp\uc2  of Birmingham, Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Several big platforms have foundered and more will probably follow, said James Wu, chief executive of Monja, a loan-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHonestly, I don\u8217\'20\'19t think many of the venture-backed lending platforms will survive in their current form,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CUnless you can find a strategic investor who wants a big share of the loan supply, the only plausible path forward is to be acquired by a bank.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170912ed210066g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

DE Shaw, which manages $27bn in assets, entered the list in third spot, while \uc2 Ken Griffin\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Citadel joined at number five. Two Sigma came in 20th place.\par \par \uc2 However, some well known hedge funds have fallen from the list this year. \uc2 Lansdowne Partners\uc2 , which joined the list for the first time in 2015 at number 20, fell out after its main fund lost 15 per cent in 2016. \uc2 Lee Ainslie\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Maverick and Jonathan Jacobson\u8217\'20\'19s Highfields fund managers also dropped from the list.\par \par \uc2 The biggest loss among the 20 managers last year was by \uc2 John Paulson\uc2 . His fund management group, \uc2 Paulson & Co\uc2 , fell six spots in the ranking to 13th place following a net loss of $3bn, according to LCH.\par \par \uc2 LCH estimates that the three newcomers, along with Bridgewater\u8217\'20\'19s Pure Alpha Fund, which also has a systematic element, have made $90bn of gains for investors over the past 10 years.\par \par \uc2 The move to include systematic funds by LCH shows the prevalence of modern quantitative trading strategies at hedge funds. The industry has largely shifted away from using solely discretionary methods to incorporating systematic trading and analysis of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe increasing capabilities of technology-based investment systems is evident in these results,\u8221\'20\'1D said Rick Sopher, chairman of LCH Investments.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese systems are being used by many of the most successful investment firms to provide alternative data sources, processed investment analysis and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ray Dalio\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Bridgewater, the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest hedge fund, held the top spot on the list, having made $49.4bn in net gains since it launched in 1975. \uc2 George Soros\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Soros Fund Management\uc2  stayed in second place with $41.8bn made since 1973, despite a net loss of $1bn last year.\par \par \uc2 While hedge funds\u8217\'20\'19 returns in 2016 mostly improved from the prior year, some managers came under fire for the high fees being charged for lacklustre results.\par \par \uc2 LCH estimates that the top 20 managers generated $16.1bn in gains after fees last year on a weighted basis, an average increase of 2.6 per cent.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe overall returns from hedge funds in 2016 were disappointing,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Sopher said. \u8220\'20\'1CEven the managers with the greatest long-term records did not perform strongly and their results were no better than the average. This underperformance by the world\u8217\'20\'19s greatest money managers reflects the difficulties experienced by most active managers for much of 2016.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The research also found that the top 20 managers generated 46.9 per cent of all the gains made by the hedge fund industry since inception, while only accounting for 17.6 per cent of the assets.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAlthough 2016 was a difficult year overall for active managers, including those which had performed strongly in the past, results improved sharply toward the end of the year,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Sopher said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis, combined with the continuing trend to lower fees, should improve the prospects for hedge fund managers to generate positive returns after fees for their investors.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170201ed21001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Since its founding six years ago it has raced to about $15bn of assets generated, pushing into new products such as\u160\'00\'A0mortgages and personal loans from its roots in student loans.\par \par \uc2 The core product of Zenbanx, which was founded in 2012 by Arkadi Kuhlmann, a former head of ING Direct, is a mobile banking account that lets people save, spend and send money in multiple currencies, both domestically and internationally. Accounts are insured through a partnership with \uc2 WSFS Bank\uc2 , the banking arm of a $6.6bn-in-assets group headquartered in Delaware.\par \par \uc2 Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but a person familiar with the deal said that SoFi would pay Zenbanx\u8217\'20\'19s venture capital backers less than $100m in stock when the deal closes in mid-February. Zenbanx accounts will then be rebranded as SoFi accounts, allowing SoFi to broaden the range of products offered to its 225,000 customers, or \u8220\'20\'1Cmembers\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Kuhlmann is joining SoFi as a member of the executive team, in charge of banking products.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSoFi and Zenbanx share a vision that banking should and can be better, and have built products and services to do it,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Mike Cagney\uc2 , SoFi\u8217\'20\'19s co-founder, chief executive and chairman.\u160\'00\'A0He said SoFi was moving \u8220\'20\'1Ccloser to becoming the centre of our members\u8217\'20\'19 financial lives\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Many online lenders have had a\u160\'00\'A0tough time over the past year, as\u160\'00\'A0choppy credit markets, rising delinquencies and a governance scandal at \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  prompted many loan buyers to put programmes on hold. That, in turn, has caused the groups to cut back on\u160\'00\'A0generating assets, squeezing their bottom lines as revenues falter.\par \par \uc2 Data from Orchard, a technology and data provider, show that volumes across US consumer-loan platforms slipped for a third successive quarter between July and September, dropping 21 per cent to $1.86bn. That was less than half of the peak in the fourth quarter last year.\par \par \uc2 One of SoFi\u8217\'20\'19s big buyers of student loans,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Citizens Financial Group\uc2 , told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  last month that it planned to taper its purchases this year, as it originates more loans of its own. \u8220\'20\'1CIf we\u8217\'20\'19re doing more on our own we need a little less from them,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Bruce van Saun\uc2 , chief executive of the Providence, Rhode Island-based bank.\par \par \uc2 Other online lenders have made efforts to diversify sources of fee income.\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Lending Club\uc2 , the San Francisco-based specialist in supplying personal loans over the web, branched out into car loans in October, while Avant of Chicago signed a deal to supply its underwriting technology to\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Regions Financial Corp\uc2  of Birmingham, Alabama.\par \par \uc2 Several big platforms have foundered and more will probably follow, said James Wu, chief executive of Monja, a loan-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHonestly, I don\u8217\'20\'19t think many of the venture-backed lending platforms will survive in their current form,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CUnless you can find a strategic investor who wants a big share of the loan supply, the only plausible path forward is to be acquired by a bank.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170201ed21007hh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The mainland industry is worth some $2.2tn, out of $9tn globally, according to logistics consultancy Armstrong & Associates.\par \par \uc2 Of that, express - effectively ecommerce delivery - accounted for $43.5bn last year and is the fastest growing segment, expanding at a compound annual rate of more than 30 per cent.\par \par \uc2 These numbers have piqued investors' interest , while cheap deliveries have wowed shoppers.\par \par \uc2 "To some degree Chinese consumers are spoiled," says Duncan Clark, chairman of consultancy BDA. "Because of the low-cost delivery options, the balance has shifted much more towards the consumer in China than it has in the US or Europe."\par \par \uc2 The average Rmb13 ($1.90) delivery fee, against $5-$10 in the US, means shoppers have no qualms about buying half a dozen jumpers and sending back five, he says. Meantime, the couriers who shuttle parcels around the towns and cities can often be spotted sorting their parcels kerbside, bikes askew.\par \par \uc2 But such scenes are being erased by the logistics industry .\par \par \uc2 "It is still changing very fast," says John Song, who leads Deloitte China's logistics and transportation practice.\par \par \uc2 "At least some of them call themselves tech companies, which means they invest big amounts of money in IT systems, \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , automation and also the last-mile delivery, using, say, drone deliveries and driverless vehicles."\par \par \uc2 Spearheading that drive is Cainiao, the tech-driven logistics network in which ecommerce giant Alibaba holds a 47 per cent stake.\par \par \uc2 Rather than an empire of warehouses and fulfilment centres like Amazon or local rival \uc2 JD.com\uc2 , Cainiao has assembled a network of 15-16 of the biggest delivery companies and built a data platform that enables speedier and more efficient service by letting couriers bundle deliveries in the same area.\par \par \uc2 Standardised addresses and mapping allow them to more easily find their destination, and Cainiao now processes seven out of every 10 packages delivered daily in China.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clark notes that Cainiao was born out of the same frustration with an inefficient national post office that prompted \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  to launch its own private parcel delivery and banking company during the California gold rush in the mid-19th century.\par \par \uc2 Wang Wenbin , chief technology officer at Cainiao, says that even with improved IT systems, Chinese couriers are still lagging behind the likes of \uc2 UPS\uc2  and \uc2 FedEx\uc2  in the US, although by starting later, China is able to leapfrog transitional changes.\par \par \uc2 China's market is more labour intensive, he says, and has other obstacles: inaccurate zip codes, for example, and in the rapidly growing cities new addresses are appearing all the time. By standardising addresses and using digital labelling codes, Cainiao has cut time, cost and errors in delivery.\par \par \uc2 Eliminating paper printing in favour of coded eshipping labels saved almost a fifth of the courier's estimated Rmb0.54 operating income per package, Mr Wang reckons. "Last year we probably saved close to Rmb1bn on shipping," he says. While that does not drop down to Cainiao's bottom line - the three-year-old company has yet to turn a profit - industry players and analysts have hailed the collaborative approach.\par \par \uc2 Jim Tompkins, who heads supply chain consultancy Tompkins International, dubs it "pre-click competition and post-click collaboration ".\par \par \uc2 By joining hands, Cainiao and traditional couriers have greater scale, he says. "It's really smart because that's the ultimate collaborative play: your stuff and my stuff is delivered together." That means more data, more packages delivered per minute. "So the cost goes down and the speed goes up."\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  can also help with managing inventory and knowing where to place it, says Mr Wang.\par \par \uc2 "If we can combine with the upstream selling data [on Alibaba platforms Taobao and Tmall] we can make a pretty good prediction beforehand how many packages, for example, will be going to Shanghai tomorrow," he says. "Eventually, we hope we can do this end-to-end forecasting" for express couriers, warehouses, and those doing supply chain management, he adds.\par \par \uc2 According to Elinor Leung, analyst at CLSA, numbers show that Amazon's model of owning the logistics assets would not work in China.\par \par \uc2 Amazon handles about 5.8m daily Investors are piling into couriers, truckers and warehouses, but with mixed results.\par \par \uc2 Private equity groups including Warburg Pincus are circling the $8bn Singapore-based warehouse operator Global Logistic Properties while Cainiao was among investors ploughing $760m into Huangzhou-based Best Logistics, which runs warehouses & distribution centres.\par \par \uc2 Last year's biggest US listing was a Chinese express delivery company, \uc2 ZTO Express\uc2 , which raised $1.4bn in October. ZTO's fellow couriers SFO Express and YTO Express both listed last year and SF Express is on the verge of completing its own backdoor listing.\par \par \uc2 Venture capital, too, has been active. Uber-style trucking company Huochebang ("truck gang"), backed by Tencent and the \uc2 International Finance Corporation\uc2 , raised funds that valued it at $1.1bn.\par \par \uc2 ZTO's performance , however, shows that the roads are not all paved with gold. Shares fell 15 per cent on its debut, and three months later are down roughly one-third. Some see the drop as a timely reminder that logistics companies may ride on the coat-tails of ecommerce but do not merit the same valuation multiples.\par \par \uc2 ZTO trades on a forward price/earnings multiple of 29.5 times, on Bloomberg numbers, or just a shade below Alibaba's 30 times.\par \par \uc2 orders with a headcount of 230,000, she says; \uc2 JD.com\uc2 , which apes the Amazon model, handles 3.5m with about 100,000. Scaling those up to Alibaba 's 33m daily orders would imply 1m employees, she says. Instead, Cainiao has just 1,200.\par \par \uc2 While Cainiao and its partners can piggyback off ecommerce's growth, challenges remain.\par \par \uc2 Deloitte's Mr Song says that further consolidation could be on the cards, noting that globally there are only three big players - \uc2 UPS\uc2 , \uc2 FedEx\uc2  and \uc2 DHL\uc2 . Extending the business model into, say, trucking or supply chain management could also prove tough, he reckons.\par \par \uc2 And competition is robust, says Evan Armstrong, president of Armstrong & Associates. Major international players "have spent significant sums building up their domestic China express delivery networks," he says. "We anticipate further investment and consolidation as the market continues its rapid growth."\par \par \uc2 Mixed showing\par \par \uc2 Investors learn roads are not all paved with gold\par \par \uc2 Investors are piling into couriers, truckers and warehouses, but with mixed results.\par \par \uc2 Private equity groups including Warburg Pincus are circling the $8bn Singapore-based warehouse operator Global Logistic Properties while Cainiao was among investors ploughing $760m into Huangzhou-based Best Logistics, which runs warehouses & distribution centres.\par \par \uc2 Last year's biggest US listing was a Chinese express delivery company, \uc2 ZTO Express\uc2 , which raised $1.4bn in October.

Two Sigma came in 20th place.\par \par \uc2 However, some well-known hedge funds have fallen from the list this year. \uc2 Lansdowne Partners\uc2 , which joined the list for the first time in 2015 at number 20, fell out after its main fund lost 15 per cent in 2016. \uc2 Lee Ainslie\uc2  's Maverick and Jonathan Jacobson 's Highfields fund managers also dropped from the list.\par \par \uc2 The biggest loss among the 20 managers last year was incurred by \uc2 John Paulson\uc2  . His fund management group, \uc2 Paulson & Co\uc2 , fell six spots in the ranking to 13th place following a net loss of $3bn, according to LCH.\par \par \uc2 LCH estimates that the three newcomers, along with Bridgewater's Pure Alpha Fund, which also has a systematic element, have made $90bn of gains for investors over the past 10 years.\par \par \uc2 The move to include systematic funds by LCH shows the prevalence of modern quantitative trading strategies at hedge funds.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Uptake Technologies Inc., the new act from \uc2 Groupon Inc\uc2 ., co-founders \uc2 Brad Keywell\uc2  and \uc2 Eric Lefkofsky\uc2 , has been valued at $2 billion in a new deal, according to a person familiar with the situation.\par \par \uc2 New investor {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/revolution-growth-looks-beyond-silicon-valley-with-525m-fund-1465943921"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Revolution Growth}}}\uc2 , a firm started by \uc2 Steve Case\uc2 , \uc2 Donn Davis\uc2  and \uc2 Ted Leonsis\uc2 , is backing the company with $40 million as part of the Series C round. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.revolution.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Revolution }}}\uc2 is focused on what it calls "the rise of the rest" companies\u8212\'20\'14the ones that are located outside of Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 Uptake sells predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  software that collects and interprets sensor data for clients in mining, rail, energy, aviation, retail, and construction industries. The Chicago company aims to leverage the data to improve safety, efficiency, and productivity of the clients' operations.\par \par \uc2 "It's about delivering an insight to a person who then takes action," Mr. Keywell said.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lot of interest and potential here," said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., referring to the industrial Internet-of-Things sector generally. "We believe it will unfold slowly. It requires retrofitting or adding sensors to your assets, requires adopting new technologies and learning new practices," he said.\par \par \uc2 Uptake, which sells software only, has seen a quick rise. Founded in 2014, the company employs about 700 people, up from 309 at the beginning of 2016, according to Mr. Keywell. It attracted such hires as Sonny Garg, former chief information officer at Exelon, as the head of its energy team, and Joseph Bradley, a former vice president of the Internet of Everything practice at \uc2 Cisco\uc2 , as Uptake's head of the business ventures team.\par \par \uc2 Uptake's valuation almost doubled from October 2015, when it was $1.1 billion. The company's revenue run-rate is now more than $100 million a year, the person said. Uptake expects to raise more capital in the latest round, said Mr. Keywell, the company's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Leonsis, who's joining Uptake's board, has known Mr. Keywell and Mr. Lefkofsky, for many years. He was, before Revolution Growth, on the boards of their previous ventures, MediaBank (now \uc2 MediaOcean\uc2 ) and \uc2 Groupon\uc2 . He also knew \uc2 Ray Lane\uc2 , another director on Uptake's board, who is a partner emeritus at \uc2 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\uc2  and former president and CEO at Oracle. Mr. Lane had {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120151027ebarnqw28"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 invested in Uptake previously}}}\uc2 , as part of \uc2 GreatPoint Ventures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We got invited in," Mr. Leonsis said of the way they deal came about.\par \par \uc2 In October he said he got Mr. Keywell tickets to a Green Day concert at the 930 Club in Washington, where Mr. Leonsis is based. They ended up getting dinner and catching up before the concert, Mr. Leonsis said. Soon thereafter Mr. Keywell called him about investing in Uptake. Revolution invested out of its $525 million Revolution Growth III fund.\par \par \uc2 The company's other backers include Lightbank, a fund headed by Mr. Lefkofsky, \uc2 New Enterprise Associates\uc2 , and \uc2 Caterpillar\uc2 , which is also a client. Last year \uc2 Caterpillar\uc2  opened a Chicago office, in part {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/downsizing-caterpillar-opens-first-chicago-office-as-analytics-focus-grows-2016-10-22"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 to be closer to Uptake}}}\uc2 , according to a \uc2 MarketWatch\uc2  report.\par \par \uc2 Large companies such as \uc2 Cisco\uc2 , \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 ., \uc2 SAP\uc2 , Bosch, and others have made a push in creating IoT products, as have numerous startups.\par \par \uc2 "I expect companies like Uptake to make some hay for a while, before life gets complicated," Mr. Gillett said about the potential of smaller, more nimble companies.\par \par \uc2 To better understand its clients, Uptake sends its employees to the field.\par \par \uc2 "We give [our data scientists] steel-toed boots," Mr. Keywell said. "That's part of the uniqueness of being in Chicago."\par \par \uc2 Correction: In an earlier version of this article, the name of \uc2 Donn Davis\uc2  was misspelled.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 More consumers became victims of identity fraud last year than at any point in more than a decade despite new security protections implemented by the credit-card industry, a report released Wednesday said.\par \par \uc2 Some 15.4 million U.S. consumers were victims of identity fraud in 2016, resulting in $16 billion in total losses, according to the report by consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research and identity-theft-protection firm \uc2 LifeLock Inc\uc2 . The number of victims rose 18% from 2015 and was the highest since Javelin, a unit of \uc2 Greenwich Associates LLC\uc2 , started tracking the phenomenon in 2003.\par \par \uc2 The increase in identity fraud, the bulk of which comes from card activity, was driven in part by a 15% rise in cases of fraudulent online purchases, the study noted. That activity led to "existing-card" fraud, which involves criminals counterfeiting debit and credit cards already held by customers, reaching a new peak.\par \par \uc2 Big increases also occurred in rarer frauds that have been steadily rising in recent years and that are harder for consumers and lenders to detect. The incidence of new-account fraud, for example, in which new accounts are opened in consumers' names without their knowledge or knowledge by the lender, rose 40% to 1.8 million, while the number of cases of consumers having a bank account, credit card or other account taken over improperly increased by over one-fifth to 1.4 million.\par \par \uc2 The increases happened despite the rollout of tougher security measures around debit and credit cards over the past couple of years. Most major card issuers in the U.S. have replaced consumers' magnetic stripe cards with chip cards, and merchants have increasingly shifted to more secure payment terminals, which combined are supposed to make it harder for consumers' card information to be stolen.\par \par \uc2 But the findings of the report suggest that swindlers are finding ways around the new measures. "Fraud is kind of like squeezing Jell-O," said \uc2 Stephen Coggeshall\uc2 , chief \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and science officer at \uc2 LifeLock\uc2 . "Stop it one place, and it migrates to somewhere else."\par \par \uc2 With online shopping, there is no way to use the chips on cards. Most of those merchants still rely on the basic card numbers, expiration dates and security codes on the cards. That is largely why "card-not-present" fraud, in which criminals use card information to make transactions online without needing to present the actual card, affected 3.4% of consumers, up from 2.4% in 2015, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 Card networks, including \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 ., say chip cards have helped bring down the counterfeit fraud rate, in which card data are stolen from merchants and used to create fake cards. \uc2 Visa\uc2  also said last month that its fraud rate at online merchants was down 1% in September from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 In response to the persistence of online card fraud, credit-card networks, banks and technology firms are investing {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tips-on-avoiding-identity-theft-1485975729"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in more secure methods }}}\uc2 of sharing payment details online, such as "tokenization," in which a unique code is generated for each transaction to be approved instead of cardholders' account numbers.\par \par \uc2 MasterCard Inc. Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Martina Hund-Mejean\uc2  said on an earnings call Tuesday that the company is increasing spending in 2017 largely to boost customer and merchant usage of its digital wallet that uses tokenization, known as Masterpass.\par \par \uc2 Separately, the study showed that nearly half of the instances of card fraud involved chip-enabled card accounts that have been used online or at stores that don't yet have chip-enabled terminals. Some 64% of storefront merchants still only accept cards' magnetic stripe, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 While other forms of identity fraud are less common than existing-card fraud, swindlers are exploiting them in part because they take longer to detect. With new-account fraud, total losses reached $3.6 billion, up 24% from 2015, even though less than 1% of consumers were affected.\par \par \uc2 Some 30% of all new-account fraud victims last year had a general-purpose credit card opened in their name, up from 21% in 2015, which often resulted in card issuers giving out chip-enabled cards to swindlers, said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security at Javelin.\par \par \uc2 Separately, total losses associated with a swindler taking over a consumer's account rose nearly two-thirds to $2.3 billion.\par \par \uc2 Still, chip usage has helped bring down the amount of losses on existing card fraud to $961 on average per incident in 2016, down 2% from a year prior and down 30% from 2013.\par \par \uc2 Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Peter Rudegeair at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tips-on-avoiding-identity-theft-1485975729"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tips on Avoiding Identity Theft}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170201ed2100565\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

They are a way of betting on its economy and a hedge against a stronger US dollar, a theme at the fore since Donald Trump's win.\par \par \uc2 "With a certain amount of inevitability the markets have almost completely stalled," said Malcolm Freeman, a director at Kingdom Futures.\par \par \uc2 One trader said the fall in volumes was partly selfreinforcing, with brokerages reluctant to take big positions or provide liquidity in the absence of Chinese investors in the "Spring Festival". As a result, some London traders were taking a holiday during Chinese new year.\par \par \uc2 Another factor weighing on activity, according to traders, is the lack of arbitrage opportunities with the Chinese markets shut. On top of that, the lunar new year has fallen just after the "third Wednesday" contract roll, which also typically sees lower volumes on the \uc2 LME\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Guy Wolf, global head of market \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at broker Marex Spectron, said it was not unusual to see \uc2 LME\uc2  volumes dip below 50 per cent of normal on certain days during the Chinese new year.\par \par \uc2 In 2015 and 2016, the slowdown was relatively mild, with volume declines of 20-25 per cent in copper. But in both those years there was intense scrutiny around the strength of the Chinese economy which stimulated demand, said Mr Wolf.\par \par \uc2 "This year, the market is much more positive on Chinese local conditions, and that relatively relaxed state is indicating we may see volume declines which are double that of the past two years," he said.\par \par \uc2 Volumes on copper traded on the \uc2 LME\uc2  fell to 4,527 lots yesterday afternoon. That compares with average daily trading volume of 53,555 lots last year. In aluminium, only 6,325 lots traded, compared with an average of 44,534 lots last year.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170131ed1v0002j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

"It's a little bit like how Amazon suggests what you might like to buy next," the person said.\par \par \uc2 The bank declined to comment, but the person said \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  hopes the new system will create a "more tailored and individual client experience", and will ultimately result in clients buying more products and services.\par \par \uc2 Clients will be able to request that certain information about their trades is known only by the people they deal directly with and not included in the general system.\par \par \uc2 The bank hopes to eventually host the system on the cloud, an online storage facility, so its sales people across the globe have the same tools and clients get the same service.\par \par \uc2 The new system is part of a wider technology and innovation investment by \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , which made almost $21bn in sales and trading revenues in 2016.\par \par \uc2 That was 15 per cent more than it made a year earlier, as the fallout from the UK's Brexit vote and then \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  's surprise election as US president drove a flurry of trading.\par \par \uc2 The underlying trend is bleaker; banks have all experienced sharp falls in trading revenues since the financial crisis began in 2008, and have also suffered a steep increase in costs, both in terms of holding extra capital and complying with new regulations.\par \par \uc2 This has made it essential for banks to find ways to become more efficient and exploit new commercial possibilities. Several banks, including \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , have tried to bolster their investment banks by getting their corporate and investment banks working more closely together, so that corporate clients get earlier and more targeted exposure to investment bank products.\par \par \uc2 Initiatives such as \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 's, and moving to electronic platforms for some products such as equities, have helped banks become more efficient.\par \par \uc2 Lenders are investing significant resources in technology as they seek new efficiencies.\par \par \uc2 But technology has also empowered a new crop of nimble competitors who offer a no-frills trading service cheaply through online portals and apps.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Ben McLannahan\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170131ed1v0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The name of Barings Real Estate Advisers was misspelled as Barings Real Estate Advisors in an earlier version of this article. (Jan. 31, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Sales of commercial real estate in Italy hit a nine-year high in 2016, driven by investors looking outside of Europe's biggest property markets for higher returns.\par \par \uc2 Property transaction volumes in Italy reached \u8364\'20\'AC9.1 billion ($9.7 billion) last year, topping the \u8364\'20\'AC8 billion in 2015 and the highest level since the \u8364\'20\'AC10.4 billion peak in 2007, according to real-estate services firm \uc2 CBRE Group Inc\uc2 . The increased demand has helped boost values of the most sought-after types of property in top cities, like stores in Milan's most fashionable shopping districts.\par \par \uc2 The size of the market in Italy remains small compared with the rest of Europe. While the Italian economy is the fourth biggest on the Continent, it accounted for just 4% of the \u8364\'20\'AC251 billion of property traded in Europe last year, CBRE said. Sweden, a much smaller economy, made up around 7% of the total.\par \par \uc2 Still, the increasing deal activity in Italy reflects a shift by some investors away from Europe's biggest markets. Following the 2008 financial crisis, investors in Europe first set their sights on the U.K., Germany and France, and later turned to countries like Spain and Ireland.\par \par \uc2 But after years of strong demand pushing up values in those markets, investors have been looking further afield. For instance, U.K. transaction volumes were nearly halved in 2016 from the year earlier, while deals in Germany fell around 27%, according to deal tracker \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Italy attracted a few U.S. private-equity investors and major global players like Houston-based Hines in the early postcrisis years. But lately they have been joined by others. Last year "marked the return of cross-border and domestic institutional investors," said Jos Tromp, head of EMEA research at CBRE.\par \par \uc2 Barings Real Estate Advisers\uc2 , based in Charlotte, N.C., recently made its first two acquisitions in Italy. In December, the firm bought an office building in Milan for \u8364\'20\'AC44.35 million. In January it bought the Nuovo Borgo shopping mall in the town of Asti, about 70 miles from Milan, for \u8364\'20\'AC51.5 million.\par \par \uc2 The property in Milan fits into Barings's plans to invest in major European office markets, said Valeria Falcone, head of Italy at the firm. The mall is in the wealthier northern part of the country, where retail has performed well even during periods of economic weakness, Ms. Falcone said.\par \par \uc2 Italy's higher yields than elsewhere in Europe "of course make it more interesting," Ms. Falcone said.\par \par \uc2 Yields for prime retail property in Milan averaged 3.25% in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with 2.25% in central London and 2.85% in Paris, CBRE data show. Milan and the surrounding area has been an especially popular destination for investors, Mr. Tromp at CBRE said.\par \par \uc2 Investing in Italy "is a way to move up the risk curve and deliver returns promised to investors," said Mahbod Nia, chief executive at NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., a U.S. real-estate investment trust. NorthStar, which focuses on the U.K., Germany and France, sold two properties in Italy last year that it had acquired in earlier portfolio deals.\par \par \uc2 Strong demand has started to push prices higher and initial returns lower for buyers. Prime office yields in Milan were 3.75% in the fourth quarter of last year, down from 5% in the same period two years earlier, CBRE data show.\par \par \uc2 Peter Papadakos\uc2 , an analyst with \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 , estimated that yields for top quality property in Italy have fallen 0.25 to 0.5 percentage point in the past year. Falling yields are a sign that prices are rising.\par \par \uc2 "Even with what we've all read about the Italian banking system, there is availability of credit from Italian banks at spreads that are very reasonable," Mr. Papadakos said. "There's nothing that's indicating the market is freezing. There's nothing that's indicating that volume is drying up."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, yields of some properties have fallen to the point that some investors are expressing concern about the Italian market overheating. They warn that the low yields could be a risk if interest rates at central banks start to rise.\par \par \uc2 "When you invest in a trophy building in the center [of Milan] at a 3% yield, that's pretty tight," said \uc2 Manfredi Catella\uc2 , chief executive at Italian property firm Coima. "Paradoxically, locations where investors perceive risk to be lowest might not be what they assume."\par \par \uc2 Investors caution that many of the perennial problems with investing in Italy remain. These include poor transparency, low liquidity, political uncertainty and weak economic growth.\par \par \uc2 "It's not one of those markets where one can autopilot a deal from abroad," said \uc2 Riccardo Dallolio\uc2 , a managing director at Miami-based private-equity firm H.I.G. Capital LLC.\par \par \uc2 H.I.G. in January bought an office building in a Milan suburb and a shopping mall about 55 miles away. The company didn't disclose what it paid. The firm's average deal size is around \u8364\'20\'AC40 million to \u8364\'20\'AC50 million, Mr. Dallolio said.\par \par \uc2 Despite challenges, investors expect demand in Italy to continue to rise this year. "There is a lot of capital chasing yield," Mr. Catella said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Art Patnaude at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:art.patnaude@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 art.patnaude@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170131ed1v003s6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Wall Street\u8217\'20\'19s biggest bank is taking a cue from Amazon in using customers\u8217\'20\'19 spending histories to sell them products or services they might want in future.\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2 , which has the biggest sales and trading businesses in the world, is launching a new Customer Relationship Management and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  system so that its sales people can sell better, a person familiar with the project said.\par \par \uc2 While CRM has been common place in other industries for decades, banks have been slow adapters. Their systems are notoriously poorly linked up, traders usually have to manually look up clients and may only then get some of the information the bank holds about that clients\u8217\'20\'19 dealings and preferences.\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s system works by linking clients\u8217\'20\'19 phone calls to profiles of the customers\u8217\'20\'19 previous trades and trading behaviours, using the same technology that call centres have employed for decades.\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  then overlays an \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  programme to help the salesperson suggest trades that would be most suited to the client. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s a little bit like how Amazon suggests what you might like to buy next,\u8221\'20\'1D the person said.\par \par \uc2 One large US institution said they did not yet have a system like \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s but it\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Ca good idea\u8221\'20\'1D. A person at a large European bank said they were planning to introduce something similar later this year which would identify callers and flash client details on to a screen\u8206\'20\'0E with details of meetings, holdings and due diligence on the client.\u8206\'20\'0E The information would be subject to controls on who could see and deal with the clients in question.\par \par \uc2 The bank declined to comment, but the person said \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  hopes the new system will create a \u8220\'20\'1Cmore tailored and individual client experience\u8221\'20\'1D, and will ultimately result in clients buying more products and services.\par \par \uc2 Clients will be able to request that certain information about their trades is known only by the people they deal directly with and not included in the general system.\par \par \uc2 The bank hopes to eventually host the system on \u8220\'20\'1Cthe cloud\u8221\'20\'1D, an online storage facility, so its sales people across the globe have the same tools and clients get the same service.\par \par \uc2 The new sales and trading system is part of a wider technology and innovation investment by \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , which made almost $21bn in sales and trading revenues in 2016.\par \par \uc2 That was 15 per cent more than \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s sales and trading revenue a year earlier, as the fallout from Brexit and then {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/donald-trump"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Donald Trump}}}\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s surprise election as US president drove a flurry of trading.\par \par \uc2 The underlying trend is bleaker; banks have all experienced sharp falls in trading revenues since the financial crisis began in 2008, and have also suffered a steep increase in costs, both in terms of holding extra capital and the cost of complying with a raft of new regulations.\par \par \uc2 This has made it essential for banks to find ways to become more efficient and exploit new commercial possibilities. Several banks, including \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , have tried to bolster their investment banks by getting their corporate and investment banks working more closely together, so that corporate clients get earlier and more targeted exposure to investment bank products.\par \par \uc2 Technology has been both a friend and foe for traditional banks. Initiatives such as \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s, and moving to electronified platforms for some products such as equities, have helped banks become more efficient. Lenders are investing significant resources in technology \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  employs more engineers than \uc2 Facebook\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 as they seek new efficiencies.\par \par \uc2 But technology has also empowered a new crop of nimble competitors who offer a no frills trading service cheaply through online portals and apps.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Ben McLannahan in New York\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020170130ed1u0050l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600
