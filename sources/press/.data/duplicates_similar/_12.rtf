In the time left, they are working to confirm certain Trump administration nominees. Succeeding at that goal will require something that has so far been lacking: a bit more reaching across the aisle.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of Trump administration picks, including individuals tapped for positions at the Treasury Department, \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  and other federal financial agencies, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-fight-over-president-donald-trumps-nominees-heats-up-1499897063"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 are pending before the full Senate for confirmation}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democrats have rejected Republican efforts to quickly advance these nominees through a process known as unanimous consent. Instead, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) in most circumstances has been invoking Senate procedures to require up to 30 hours of debate per nominee, an amount of Senate floor time that means lawmakers can't confirm more than a handful of nominees each week.\par \par \uc2 That could change as early as Thursday. Senate lawmakers are eager to leave town for their summer break and the health-care bill has collapsed, opening the door to other legislative priorities. Leaders of both parties say they are hopeful they will be able to reach a deal to unanimously confirm dozens of pending nominees.\par \par \uc2 While Senate leaders have declined to say which nominees would be included in any deal, Republican aides said a package could include {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-panel-advances-nomination-of-kevin-hassett-as-economic-adviser-1497471822"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Kevin Hassett, President Donald Trump's pick to head the Council of Economic Advisers}}}\uc2 , as well as individuals tapped for vacancies at the Treasury, CFTC, Department of Housing and Urban Development and Commerce Department.\par \par \uc2 Though prospects for a deal are high, it's unlikely any agreement in the next week or two will include Mr. Trump's picks for the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-to-nominate-hester-peirce-as-republican-sec-commissioner-1500417225"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission}}}\uc2  or the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-randal-quarles-trumps-pick-to-shake-up-the-fed-1501234201"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Federal Reserve}}}\uc2 , because those nominees have yet to clear the Senate Banking Committee, a crucial step before the full Senate can vote on them. As a result, it's unlikely these nominees will be confirmed until the fall, according to Senate aides.\par \par \uc2 It's far from a new era of cross-party comity. But the upshot of last week's collapse of GOP health-care legislation could mean the Senate is finally able to confirm a number of individuals to long-vacant posts\u8212\'20\'14a signal of slightly less partisanship in the chamber.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18London Whale' Has a New Target: \uc2 J.P.

Morgan trader in London, agreed to testify against two ex-coworkers for their roles in a 2012 trading debacle that cost the bank more than $6 billion. But over the past year, Mr. Iksil changed his story.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Iksil's shifting explanations about who was responsible helped end the high-profile U.S. criminal case, the person said.

The nominees were approved via voice vote, so there were no recorded dissenting votes. The nominees now proceed to the Senate floor for a vote, though it's unclear when that might occur, given a massive backlog of Trump administration nominees. Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, said last week that she wanted a full slate of nominees\u8212\'20\'14which would include an additional Democratic commissioner\u8212\'20\'14before proceeding to a floor vote.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: \uc2 MetLife\uc2  v.

The court indicated Wednesday it wouldn't decide the case anytime soon, and directed the parties to report back on next moves either by Nov. 17, or 30 days after the Treasury secretary issues an expected report related to federal oversight of nonbank financial firms, whichever is sooner.

After seeing how the industry was evolving, he said the choice was simple: "I had the choice between being the disrupter or the disrupted."\par \par \uc2 Quantitative hedge funds use complex algorithms to sniff out and take advantage of millions of small but lucrative trading opportunities. They are now proving increasingly popular, reflecting in part a long run of underwhelming performance and expensive fees across the broader industry.\par \par \uc2 The widening access to faster and cheaper computing power, coupled with an explosion of digital data such as satellite images, internet chatter and online commerce, has encouraged scientists and programmers to turn their expertise towards financial markets.\par \par \uc2 The challenges are profound. But with many big quant hedge funds also seeing returns moderate as their size swells, some investors are cautiously turning to these smaller, fledgling funds rather than big, established players such as DE Shaw, Renaissance and Two Sigma.\par \par \uc2 A few years ago, most investor money was ploughed into a star "prop" trader leaving one of Wall Street's blue-chip investment banks or an established portfolio manager splitting from his firm, while quant upstarts would struggle to raise money without a long record at a bank or asset manager.\par \par \uc2 These days, however, some investors are more willing to take a punt on "emerging" managers - especially if they have a solid grounding in science and the algorithmic investment world.\par \par \uc2 "Our machines never sleep," says Andrej Rusakov , one of the co-founders of Data Capital Management. "The future is systematic investment. There is no way it isn't."\par \par \uc2 There were 179 hedge funds launched in the first quarter of 2017, according to HFR. The data provider estimates about 55-60 of them were quant funds. While HFR does not have historical data on this area, it says "anecdotally" the number of quant hedge fund launches is clearly on the rise.\par \par \uc2 Assets managed by so-called systematic hedge funds have doubled in the past decade and hit a record $500bn this year, according to \uc2 Barclays\uc2  research. Even this probably understates the area's popularity, as many traditional mutual funds are turning to quant techniques to improve returns.\par \par \uc2 Emerging hedge fund managers often do better than their bigger peers. Research by Preqin, a data provider, shows new hedge funds with assets of $300m or less have consistently enjoyed higher rolling 12-month returns than the broader industry since January 2012, and returned 14.1 per cent over the past year. They also boast a higher "Sharpe ratio", a popular measure of returns when adjusted for the riskiness of their bets.\par \par \uc2 While Preqin's data are on new hedge funds overall rather than just quants, some investors are convinced the future belongs to these players.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Tarrant of Prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 Partners has launched a $1bn vehicle to invest solely in start-up investment funds that use artificial techniques such as \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Jeff Bezos picked off the bookstore business. Apple totally picked off the music business and \uc2 Netflix\uc2  totally changed television. Now [\b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 ] is going to pick off the hedge funds," he told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Many of these start-ups will clearly fail, but even some of the hedge fund industry's biggest stars think this is where the wind is blowing. \uc2 Paul Tudor Jones\uc2  , a hedge fund pioneer, has invested in two new quant hedge funds, Numerai and CargoMetrics.\par \par \uc2 Steven Cohen\uc2  of Point72 has also invested in \uc2 Quantopian\uc2 , a novel " crowdsourced " quant hedge fund, and like Mr Jones is investing heavily in data scientists and programmers to help his firm.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, there are some significant hurdles. While data and technology costs have come down considerably, they are still pricey to shoulder without any institutional backing - which remains tough to get. Many investors are still wary of what looks like a "black box" to non-experts.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the established quant powerhouses collectively employ thousands of PhD-level data scientists, mathematicians and programmers that are already scouring global markets for any tradeable patterns.\par \par \uc2 Many aspiring quants who think they have found a lucrative pattern in markets are often disappointed when they begin trading and discover the signals prove illusory or fade quickly from view.\par \par \uc2 "The ability to acquire data is much easier and cheaper than it was, and there is a lot of strong entrepreneurial talent coming up," says Stephen Prince, the North American head at Tetragon, an investment group that invests in hedge funds. "Because of that, there are some compelling opportunities among a handful of new managers. But you have to keep your eyes open to the challenges."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170802ed8200029\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Two years after its much-hyped IPO, \uc2 Etsy Inc\uc2 . finds itself in a predicament familiar to the rest of the retail industry: Sales are slowing and investors are frustrated.\par \par \uc2 The online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, which calls itself a "sophisticated technology platform" and says it treats "code as craft," is now under pressure to stop spending like a tech startup and start acting like a retailer.\par \par \uc2 "We're trying to find the right balance between a tech company and an e-commerce company," \uc2 Fred Wilson\uc2 , a venture capitalist and chairman of Etsy's board, said in an interview. "Engineering is still critically important, but we don't need to build technology for technology's sake."\par \par \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's new CEO, \uc2 Josh Silverman\uc2 , who took over in May, has slashed spending and is focusing on reviving the company's core marketplace, in which revenue growth has slowed in each of the past four years. "We have invested too much in building our version of things that already exist in the market," Mr. Silverman said.\par \par \uc2 Last year, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  booked a $30 million loss as higher costs offset a 33% jump in revenue to $365 million. In the first quarter, operating expenses rose 36% from a year ago, or twice as rapidly as revenue. The company reports its latest results on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Several people familiar with \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's thinking say the company has grappled with the expectations of public markets and failed to prioritize its marketplace, which now accounts for less than half of its revenue. Since 2015, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  generates most of its money from providing add-on services to merchants, such as shipping labels and advertising. Shares shot above $30 in their first day of trading in April 2015 but soon crumbled and have been trading below the $16 IPO price for about the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Hedge fund Black-and-White Capital LP publicly criticized the company in May, citing issues from \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's "horrendous search functionality" to a "historical pattern of ill-advised spending." The firm, along with buyout giant TPG and others, have encouraged \uc2 Etsy\uc2  to explore a sale of the company.\par \par \uc2 Asked if the company was for sale, Mr. Silverman said he would have to consider any offers that may surface but he is focused on revamping the business. "Step one is to have a plan and confidence in the plan and only then could we weigh any offers," he said.\par \par \uc2 Etsy\uc2 , according to former and current executives, long prided itself on building its own technology -- even touting the number of times it deployed code daily -- but many of the homegrown products, such as the site's email system and search engine, had limited capabilities.\par \par \uc2 The site's technology frustrated Amy Stringer-Mowat, who has been selling cutting boards on the marketplace since 2010.\par \par \uc2 When her items seemed to stop showing up in search results as frequently and her revenue declined, she shifted more of her business, American Heirloom, to her own e-commerce site.\par \par \uc2 "Everything felt like an experiment on \uc2 Etsy\uc2 ," she said. "I realized I could make better use of my time figuring out my own \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  rather than figuring out \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's algorithms."\par \par \uc2 Growth in \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's core marketplace business -- derived from charging transaction and listing fees -- began decelerating a few years before its IPO.\par \par \uc2 In search of growth, \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's previous CEO, \uc2 Chad Dickerson\uc2 , invested in business tools for merchants and an overseas expansion.\par \par \uc2 In May, the company announced plans to cut 8% of its workforce and said Mr. Dickerson, who had run the Brooklyn, N.Y., company since 2011, was being succeeded by Mr. Silverman, a former Skype and \uc2 eBay\uc2  executive.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Silverman is centralizing marketing in international markets and deploying more outside technology, a shift from the company's guerrilla-type marketing approach and do-it-all-yourself engineering culture.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich446\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal6690

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 About three years ago, when turmoil from the Arab Spring was spreading throughout the Mediterranean region, a fledgling Spanish real-estate investment trust backed by U.S. investors \uc2 George Soros\uc2 , John Paulson and others made a big bet the unrest would benefit the resort sector in Spain.\par \par \uc2 The wager was that tourists would eschew countries such as Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey in favor of the relative calm of the Canary Islands, Balearic Islands and other Spanish vacation spots.\par \par \uc2 "We saw that the political situation wasn't going to get better anytime soon," said \uc2 Cristina Garcia-Peri\uc2 , general manager of the REIT, known as \uc2 Hispania Activos Inmobiliarios SA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 They were right. Shares of Hispania, which were first sold to the public in 2014 at 10 euros ($11.84) apiece, closed at 15.39 euros on Tuesday, thanks mainly to the performance of the company's portfolio of 39 hotels. The company also owns office buildings in Madrid and Barcelona, which have been doing well.\par \par \uc2 Shareholders of Hispania, now one of Spain's largest resort owners, will be cashing out in the next few years as the company moves forward with plans to liquidate its assets.\par \par \uc2 The private-equity firm that founded and is managing Hispania, Azora Gestion Inmobiliaria SL, promised to move in and out of the market relatively quickly when it first went public.\par \par \uc2 The question now is whether the buyers of Hispania's assets will enjoy the same good fortune as its current owners.\par \par \uc2 The eight-year bull market in European and North American real estate is considered by many to be getting long in the tooth.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Hispania's resorts could be hurt if political calm returns to the Middle East and other countries now being avoided by many because of conflict and the refugee crisis.\par \par \uc2 Either way, Hispania's early years will likely be viewed as a success story in the formative years of Spain's fledgling REIT sector. Since 2014, more than 35 REITs have been formed.\par \par \uc2 Since 2013, domestic REITs have purchased 11.6 billion euros of commercial real estate, or about 26% of the total purchased during that period, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Last year, they accounted for 45% of the market, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 Deal activity could increase if Spanish REITs move into an era of consolidation, as many predict.\par \par \uc2 Representatives of Messrs. Soros and Paulson declined to comment.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170802000034"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170802ed820000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Two years after its much-hyped IPO, \uc2 Etsy Inc\uc2 . finds itself in a predicament familiar to the rest of the retail industry: Sales are slowing and investors are frustrated.\par \par \uc2 The online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods is now under pressure to stop spending like a tech startup and start acting like a retailer.\par \par \uc2 "We're trying to find the right balance between a tech company and an e-commerce company," \uc2 Fred Wilson\uc2 , a venture capitalist and chairman of Etsy's board, said in an interview. "Engineering is still critically important, but we don't need to build technology for technology's sake."\par \par \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's new chief executive, \uc2 Josh Silverman\uc2 , who took over in May, has slashed spending and is focusing on reviving the company's core marketplace, in which revenue growth has slowed in each of the past four years.\par \par \uc2 "We have invested too much in building our version of things that already exist in the market," Mr. Silverman said.\par \par \uc2 Last year, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  booked a $30 million loss as higher costs offset a 33% jump in revenue to $365 million. In the first quarter, operating expenses rose 36% from a year ago, or twice as rapidly as revenue. The company reports its latest results on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Several people familiar with \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's thinking say the company has grappled with the expectations of public markets and failed to prioritize its marketplace, which now accounts for less than half of its revenue. Since 2015, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  generates most of its money from providing add-on services to merchants, such as shipping labels and advertising. Shares shot above $30 in their first day of trading in April 2015 but soon crumbled and have been trading below the $16 IPO price for about the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Hedge fund Black-and-White Capital LP publicly criticized the company in May, citing issues from \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's "horrendous search functionality" to a "historical pattern of ill-advised spending." The firm, along with buyout giant TPG and others, have encouraged \uc2 Etsy\uc2  to explore a sale of the company.\par \par \uc2 Asked if the company was for sale, Mr. Silverman said he would have to consider any offers that might surface but he is focused on revamping the business. "Step one is to have a plan and confidence in the plan and only then could we weigh any offers," he said.\par \par \uc2 Etsy\uc2 , according to former and current executives, long prided itself on building its own technology but many of the homegrown products, such as the site's email system and search engine, had limited capabilities.\par \par \uc2 The site's technology frustrated Amy Stringer-Mowat, who has been selling cutting boards on the marketplace since 2010.\par \par \uc2 When her items seemed to stop showing up in search results as frequently and her revenue declined, she shifted more of her business, American Heirloom, to her own e-commerce site.\par \par \uc2 "Everything felt like an experiment on \uc2 Etsy\uc2 ," she said. "I realized I could make better use of my time figuring out my own \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  rather than figuring out \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's algorithms."\par \par \uc2 Growth in \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's core marketplace business derived from charging transaction and listing fees began decelerating a few years before its initial public offering. Some analysts say finding secondary revenue streams such as selling search ads and shipping services to merchants has been necessary because \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's marketplace has limited growth potential.\par \par \uc2 "Artisanal goods is a relatively small addressable retail market," said Cooper Smith, research director at L2, a digital brand consultancy. "\uc2 Etsy\uc2  is never going to scale to what \uc2 Amazon\uc2  can because its merchants are not major brands and they don't have a lot of merchandise."\par \par \uc2 In search of growth, \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's previous CEO, \uc2 Chad Dickerson\uc2 , invested in business tools for merchants and an overseas expansion. To prevent successful merchants from leaving the site, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  also loosened its rules to allow items produced in small manufacturing plants, departing from its handmade-only policy.\par \par \uc2 Executives continued investing over the past year, including the acquisition of a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  startup, a new marketplace for craft supplies and a brand-marketing campaign. After its IPO, \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's head count increased more than 30% to 1,043 by the end of 2016.\par \par \uc2 The company also moved into a 200,000-square-foot building in Brooklyn featuring a dining hall serving locally catered meals, breathing rooms for weekly yoga sessions and a rooftop with solar panels, among other amenities.\par \par \uc2 In May, the company announced plans to eliminate 8% of its workforce and said Mr. Dickerson, who had run the company since 2011, was being succeeded by Mr. Silverman, a former executive with Skype and \uc2 eBay\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Investors cheered the move on hopes that the company will find a buyer. Shares of \uc2 Etsy\uc2  have surged about 30% since the CEO change.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Silverman is centralizing marketing in international markets and deploying more outside technology, a shift from the company's guerrilla-type marketing approach and do-it-all-yourself engineering culture.\par \par \uc2 In June, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  said it would cut an additional 15% of its staff, bringing the total layoffs to 230 jobs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Silverman also intends to leverage customer data to offer more personalized product recommendations. As part of its new technology approach, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  on Monday named a new chief technology officer, Mike Fisher, the co-founder of consulting firm AKF Partners.\par \par \uc2 "Driving more visitors to the site, doing a better job of converting those visits to purchases, and getting buyers to come back" are the biggest priorities, Mr. Silverman said. "It doesn't necessarily mean spending more money."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170801000046"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170801ed8200012\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Investors are poking holes in a popular bet on the U.S. bond insurance business.\par \par \uc2 Shares of \uc2 Assured Guaranty Ltd\uc2 . and \uc2 MBIA Inc\uc2 . rallied in July, driven higher by investor expectations the bond insurance industry would continue to consolidate, said CreditSights analyst Josh Esterov. But other investors are questioning the rally. Short interest, a measure of negative bets, on Assured and \uc2 MBIA\uc2  rose by 18% and 16%, respectively, over the same month to roughly $400 million, according to financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm S3 Partners LLC.\par \par \uc2 The two are monoline insurance companies that guarantee billions of dollars of U.S. municipal bonds and structured finance products. Bond insurers, an often-forgotten category of U.S. financial stocks, sell policies that depend on the strength of their balance sheets. Their most problematic exposure at the moment is Puerto Rico, which has asked them to cover billions of dollars in shortfalls on municipal debt obligations.\par \par \uc2 The rising short bets correlate to deteriorating conditions on the island. Early in July, Puerto Rico's federal financial supervisors {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-officials-to-place-puerto-rico-utility-in-bankruptcy-1498832934"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  placed its public power monopoly }}}\uc2  under what amounts to bankruptcy protection, exposing \uc2 MBIA\uc2  and Assured to losses on more than $2 billion in utility debt.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 MBIA\uc2 's efforts to win market share evaporated in late June when S&P Global Ratings cut the company's credit rating, forcing it to stop writing new municipal bond policies. It sparked a somewhat counterintuitive stock rally as investors took the downgrade as a potential catalyst for \uc2 MBIA\uc2  to seek a merger partner, Mr. Esterov said.\par \par \uc2 Assured has shown a desire to consolidate the sector before, striking deals in recent years to acquire CIFG Holding Inc., \uc2 Radian Asset Assurance Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 MBIA\uc2 's U.K. business. Normally, buying \uc2 MBIA\uc2  would remove another source of competition. The S&P downgrade, though, "did that for them," said William Bonawitz, research director at PNC Capital Markets.\par \par \uc2 MBIA\uc2  told shareholders it had "reluctantly, but prudently and appropriately, ceased for now our efforts to actively pursue writing new insurance policies" but would "retool in a manner that continues to protect the interests of all of our policyholders."\par \par \uc2 Write to Andrew Scurria at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Related Coverage\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/creditors-of-puerto-rico-utility-demand-a-receiver-1500406259"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Creditors of Puerto Rico Utility Demand a Receiver }}}\uc2  (July 18)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-ricos-troubles-create-new-opportunities-for-investors-1500307504"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Puerto Rico's Troubles Create New Opportunities for Investors }}}\uc2  (July 17)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-insurers-sue-puerto-rico-board-to-enforce-9-billion-utility-deal-1498574356"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bond Insurers Sue Puerto Rico Board to Enforce $9 Billion Utility Deal }}}\uc2  (June 27)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170801ed81002sq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  will soon use a first-of-its-kind robot to execute trades across its global equities algorithms business, after a European trial of the bank's new \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  programme showed it was more efficient than traditional methods of buying and selling.\par \par \uc2 The AI, known internally as LOXM, has been used in the bank's European equities algorithms business since the first quarter and will be launched in Asia and the US in the fourth, Daniel Ciment, \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  head of global equities electronic trading, told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 LOXM's job is to execute client orders with maximum speed at the best price, by using lessons it has learnt from billions of past trades - real and simulated - to tackle problems such as how best to offload big equity stakes without moving market prices.\par \par \uc2 "Such customisation was previously implemented by humans, but now the AI machine is able to do it on a much larger and more efficient scale," said David Fellah, of JPMorgan's European Equity Quant Research team.\par \par \uc2 Mr Ciment said the European trials so far showed the pricing achieved by LOXM was "significantly better" than its benchmark.\par \par \uc2 Investment banks have been trying to use AI, automation and robotics to help cut costs and eliminate routine work. For example, \uc2 UBS\uc2  has deployed AI to deal with client post-trade allocation requests, saving as much as 45 minutes of labour per task. \uc2 UBS\uc2  has also brought in AI to help clients trade volatility.\par \par \uc2 "Best execution is becoming more and more important to clients," said Mr Ciment of \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 's decision to invest in the pioneering technology, adding it could become part of the marketing pitch the bank makes to clients.\par \par \uc2 One possible evolution of LOXM is teaching the machine how to get to know individual clients, so it could consider their behaviour and reaction as it decides how to trade. "Any customisation would only be if the client agrees to that," Mr Ciment added.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the robo advisers at some private banks, \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 's AI has no decision-making capabilities.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170801ed8100026\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

In a worse-case scenario, this could lead to a government shutdown as well as market turmoil.\par \par \uc2 While yields on three-month Treasury bills subsided somewhat at the end of last week, jitters have come sooner than during debt ceiling countdowns of 2011 and 2013, according to Mark Cabana, a strategist at \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2 . This is striking given Republicans have control of both wings of Congress and the White House, which ought to put them in a stronger position to reach a deal.\par \par \uc2 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said it was reasonable for investors to be getting a little nervous. "This is an administration that has shown it can't get anything done. Absolutely nothing," he said.\par \par \uc2 Congress sets a limit on the federal government's debt in law, which currently stands at $19.8tn. Once the limit bites, the Treasury can no longer borrow and, if it were to exhaust other ways of making payments, it would have to miss, delay or reduce payments.\par \par \uc2 The Treasury bumped up against the debt limit in March, so the Treasury has since then been using so-called "extraordinary measures" to buy Congress more time to act on the debt limit. The \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  and the \uc2 Bipartisan Policy Center\uc2  both estimate that those measures will finally expire in early-to-mid October.\par \par \uc2 The risk of a stand-off has implications for monetary policy, as well as markets. The Fed signalled in its latest meeting that it could start paring back its purchases of securities including government debt as soon as its September 19-20 meeting.\par \par \uc2 Investors said the Fed might choose to wait before starting to curtail purchases of government bonds if the Treasury is grappling with serious bond market turbulence. The central bank showed in early and mid-2016 it was reluctant to make important policy moves when financial markets were going haywire.\par \par \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2 , the Treasury secretary, has repeatedly urged Congress to lift the ceiling before its recess, but lawmakers have ignored his pleas, with the House adjourning for its summer break with no resolution in sight. "It does put them in a little bit of an awkward spot," Mr Cabana said. "The Fed may be thinking we don't want to have our monetary policy decisions unduly influenced by political developments, especially given every other debt limit issue has been resolved." Fear also exists that the debt ceiling discussion could get intermingled with other issues in Congress, in particular discussions over the 2018 budget and the potential for a government shutdown after the expiry of the fiscal year on September 30.\par \par \uc2 Rightwing Republicans including the Freedom Caucus have said they will only sign up to legislation addressing the debt ceiling if they get tough conditions on spending attached.\par \par \uc2 They used this gambit against \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , the former president; it is striking now to see them using it against a president and Treasury secretary from their own party. Any attempt by conservative Republicans to advance their broader public spending agenda in a debt ceiling bill would probably be immediately rebuffed by Democrats, however.\par \par \uc2 On top of this, the Trump administration has been sending confused signals over its debt ceiling strategy.\par \par \uc2 Mr Mnuchin has been calling for a "clean" bill increasing the debt limit, without any conditions attached. However, \uc2 Mick Mulvaney\uc2 , the president's budget chief, has publicly supported the idea of attaching riders, creating an impression of internal conflict in the Trump administration.\par \par \uc2 Both Mr Trump and Mr Mnuchin have said it might be possible to have a "good" government shutdown - heightening the risk of brinkmanship.\par \par \uc2 Shai Akabas of the \uc2 Bipartisan Policy Center\uc2  said most investors felt confident the debt limit would get worked out. But if just "one iota of doubt" crept in, it would affect how they thought about the relevant government securities, he said.\par \par \uc2 Insight see Markets\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170801ed8100010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 About three years ago, when turmoil from the Arab Spring was spreading throughout the Mediterranean region, a fledgling Spanish real-estate investment trust backed by U.S. investors \uc2 George Soros\uc2 , John Paulson and others made a big bet the unrest would benefit the resort sector in Spain.\par \par \uc2 The wager was that tourists would eschew countries such as Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey in favor of the relative calm of the Canary Islands, Balearic Islands and other Spanish vacation spots.\par \par \uc2 "We saw that the political situation wasn't going to get better anytime soon," said \uc2 Cristina Garc\u237\'00\'EDa-Peri\uc2 , general manager of the REIT, known as \uc2 Hispania Activos Inmobiliarios SA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 They were right. Shares of Hispania, which were first sold to the public in 2014 at \u8364\'20\'AC10 a piece, are trading in the \u8364\'20\'AC15.50 range today, thanks mainly to the performance of the company's portfolio of 39 hotels. The company also owns office buildings in Madrid and Barcelona, which have been doing well.\par \par \uc2 Shareholders of Hispania, now one of Spain's largest resort owners, will be cashing out in the next few years as the company moves forward with plans to liquidate its assets.\par \par \uc2 The private-equity firm that founded and is managing Hispania, Azora Gesti\u243\'00\'F3n Inmobiliaria SL, promised to move in and out of the market relatively quickly when it first went public.\par \par \uc2 The question now is whether the buyers of Hispania's assets will enjoy the same good fortune as its current owners. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-investors-cut-back-on-commercial-property-as-bull-market-loses-steam-1486463401"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 eight-year bull market}}}\uc2  in European and North American real estate is considered by many to be getting long in the tooth.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Hispania's resorts could be hurt if political calm returns to the Middle East and other countries now being avoided by many because of conflict and the refugee crisis. "If the security situation improves around the Mediterranean and things quiet down, all of a sudden there is more competition," said \uc2 Peter Papadakos\uc2 , analyst with real-estate investment researcher \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Either way, Hispania's early years will likely be viewed as a success story in the formative years of Spain's fledgling REIT sector. Since 2014, more than 35 REITs\u8212\'20\'14or Socimis as they are known in Spain\u8212\'20\'14have been formed, pumping billions of euros into the country's real-estate sector.\par \par \uc2 Since 2013, domestic REITs have purchased \u8364\'20\'AC11.6 billion of commercial real estate, or about 26% of the total purchased during that period, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Last year, they accounted for 45% of the market, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 Deal activity could increase if Spanish REITs move into an era of consolidation, as many predict. "There is more competition and a way to react to that competition will be mergers and specialization," said Orson Alcocer, a real estate partner with the law firm \uc2 DLA Piper\uc2  in Madrid.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spain-needs-to-tackle-tax-loopholes-oecd-says-1410172202"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Spanish real estate }}}\uc2 looked more challenging in 2013, when Azora executives began making plans to form Hispania.\par \par \uc2 Sales activity and values were weak when Hispania was launched as the Spanish economy struggled to recover from the global financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 But there were promising signs. Labor overhauls by the government led by Spanish Prime Minister \uc2 Mariano Rajoy\uc2  was sparking job growth while {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spains-finance-minister-slams-eus-deficit-target-fixation-1444232022"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 financial overhauls}}}\uc2  were moving banks to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spanish-banks-push-own-properties-1397421548"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 unload troubled assets }}}\uc2 to investors beginning to look for deals.\par \par \uc2 The government also made important changes to the Spanish REIT laws, making them more attractive. No REITs were formed under the original legislation, which was "a complete failure," said Mr. Alcocer of \uc2 DLA Piper\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Garc\u237\'00\'EDa-Peri said Azora executives reached out to Messrs. Soros and Paulson when they were touting Hispania on a roadshow. "They were probably two of the most convinced believers that real estate was a very good way to play the Spanish recovery," she said.\par \par \uc2 Representatives of Messrs. Soros and Paulson declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Hispania originally was a so-called cash box REIT that raised \u8364\'20\'AC550 million from investors before it owned any property. Funds controlled by Messrs. Paulson and Soros bought early and owned 18.4% and 16.7%, respectively, by late 2014.\par \par \uc2 The company's resort strategy evolved as it studied where best to invest the funds. Hispania recognized Spain's low prices made its resorts appealing to European holiday travelers even before political tensions tarnished competitive resort markets. "We are south of 300 million people that are richer than us and their weather is pretty horrible," Ms. Garc\u237\'00\'EDa-Peri said.\par \par \uc2 Hispania went on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/paulson-soros-property-fund-mulls-spanish-takeover-1416484989"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a shopping spree}}}\uc2 , buying properties from undercapitalized small operators and debt from banks looking to unload assets. Its business plan typically has involved buying two- and three-star resorts and upgrading them to four and five stars.\par \par \uc2 In the early years, Hispania also was able to buy higher-quality properties at discounts, especially compared with property values today. In 2015, for example, the company paid \u8364\'20\'AC105 million for the Gran Hotel Atlantis Bah\u237\'00\'EDa Real and the Hotel Guadalmina Golf, both in the Canary Islands.\par \par \uc2 The market has since steadily improved. Spain's tourism market is shaping up to hit a record this year. In the first five months of 2017, nonresidents stayed at hotels in the country 97,804 nights, up from 92,352 during the same period last year, according to \uc2 Eurostat\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Occupancy in the Canary Islands was 86.1% in 2016, up 4.2% from the previous year, according to data firm STR. Revenue per available room, a widely followed metric in the hotel industry, was up 4.2%, STR said.\par \par \uc2 "We delay bookings because the longer we wait the higher [the rate] we can sell," said Ms. Garc\u237\'00\'EDa-Peri.\par \par \uc2 Write to Peter Grant at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:peter.grant@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 peter.grant@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170801ed81002h2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Two years after its much-hyped IPO, \uc2 Etsy Inc\uc2 . finds itself in a predicament familiar to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brick-and-mortar-stores-are-shuttering-at-a-record-pace-1492818818"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rest of the retail industry}}}\uc2 : sales are slowing and investors are frustrated.\par \par \uc2 The online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, which calls itself a "sophisticated technology platform" and says it treats "code as craft," is now under pressure to stop spending like a tech startup and start acting like a retailer.\par \par \uc2 "We're trying to find the right balance between a tech company and an e-commerce company," \uc2 Fred Wilson\uc2 , a venture capitalist and chairman of Etsy's board, said in an interview. "Engineering is still critically important, but we don't need to build technology for technology's sake."\par \par \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's new CEO, \uc2 Josh Silverman\uc2 , who took over in May, has slashed spending and is focusing on reviving the company's core marketplace, where revenue growth has slowed in each of the past four years. "We have invested too much in building our version of things that already exist in the market," Mr. Silverman said.\par \par \uc2 Last year, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  booked a $30 million loss as higher costs offset a 33% jump in revenue to $365 million. In the first quarter, operating expenses rose 36% from a year ago, or twice as fast as revenue. The company reports its latest results on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Several people familiar with \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's thinking say the company has grappled with the expectations of public markets and failed to prioritize its marketplace, which now accounts for less than half of its revenue. Since 2015, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  generates most of its money from providing add-on services to merchants, such as shipping labels and advertising. Shares shot above $30 in their first day of trading in April 2015 but soon crumbled and have been trading below the $16 IPO price for about the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Hedge fund Black-and-White Capital LP publicly criticized the company in May, citing issues from \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's "horrendous search functionality" to a "historical pattern of ill-advised spending." The firm, along with buyout giant TPG and others, have encouraged \uc2 Etsy{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tpg-borrows-page-from-activist-playbook-in-buying-etsy-stake-1494976626"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 to explore a sale of the company}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Asked if the company was for sale, Mr. Silverman said he would have to consider any offers that may surface but he is focused on revamping the business. "Step one is to have a plan and confidence in the plan and only then could we weigh any offers," he said.\par \par \uc2 Etsy\uc2 , according to former and current executives, long prided itself on building its own technology\u8212\'20\'14even touting the number of times it deployed code daily\u8212\'20\'14but many of the homegrown products, such as the site's email system and search engine, had limited capabilities.\par \par \uc2 The site's technology frustrated Amy Stringer-Mowat, who has been selling cutting boards on the marketplace since 2010. When her items seemed to stop showing up in search results as frequently and her revenue dipped, she shifted more of her business, American Heirloom, to her own e-commerce site.\par \par \uc2 "Everything felt like an experiment on \uc2 Etsy\uc2 ," she said. "I realized I could make better use of my time figuring out my own \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  rather than figuring out \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's algorithms."\par \par \uc2 Growth in \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's core marketplace business\u8213\'20\'15derived from charging transaction and listing fees\u8213\'20\'15began decelerating a few years before its IPO. Some analysts say finding secondary revenue streams such as selling search ads and shipping services to merchants has been necessary because \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's marketplace has limited growth potential.\par \par \uc2 "Artisanal goods is a relatively small addressable retail market," said Cooper Smith, research director at L2, a digital brand consultancy. "\uc2 Etsy\uc2  is never going to scale to what \uc2 Amazon\uc2  can because its merchants are not major brands and they don't have a lot of merchandise."\par \par \uc2 In search of growth, \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's longtime CEO \uc2 Chad Dickerson\uc2  invested in business tools for merchants and an overseas expansion. To prevent successful merchants from leaving the site, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  also loosened its rules to allow items produced in small manufacturing plants, departing from its handmade-only policy.\par \par \uc2 Executives continued investing over the past year, including the acquisition of a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  startup, a new marketplace for craft supplies and a brand-marketing campaign. After its IPO, \uc2 Etsy\uc2 's headcount increased more than 30% to 1,043 by the end of 2016.\par \par \uc2 The company also made a big splash when it moved into a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/etsy-online-source-for-artisanal-goods-to-expand-in-brooklyn-1399991571"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 200,000-square-foot building in Brooklyn}}}\uc2 \u8213\'20\'15featuring a dining hall serving locally catered meals, breathing rooms for weekly yoga sessions and a rooftop with solar panels, among other amenities.\par \par \uc2 In May, the company announced plans to cut 8% of its workforce and said Mr. Dickerson, who had run the Brooklyn, N.Y., company since 2011, was being succeeded by Mr. Silverman, a former Skype and \uc2 eBay\uc2  executive.\par \par \uc2 Investors cheered the move on hopes that the company will find a buyer. Shares of \uc2 Etsy\uc2  have surged about 30%, closing Monday at $14.37 a share, since the CEO change.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Silverman is centralizing marketing in international markets and deploying more outside technology, a shift from the company's guerrilla-type marketing approach and do-it-all-yourself engineering culture.\par \par \uc2 In June, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  said it would cut {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/etsy-cuts-another-15-of-workforce-1498054690"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 another 15% of its staff}}}\uc2 , bringing the total layoffs to 230 jobs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Silverman also intends to leverage customer data to offer more personalized product recommendations. As part of its new technology approach, \uc2 Etsy\uc2  on Monday named a new chief technology officer, Mike Fisher, the co-founder of consulting firm AKF Partners.\par \par \uc2 "Driving more visitors to the site, doing a better job of converting those visits to purchases, and getting buyers to come back" are the biggest priorities, Mr. Silverman said. "It doesn't necessarily mean spending more money."\par \par \uc2 Write to Khadeeja Safdar at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170801ed81001ry\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Mr. Abbott, former vice president of engineering at Twitter, was one of five GPs at Kleiner's{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kleiner-perkins-raises-1-4b-for-two-new-funds-1467236436"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  $400 million early-stage fund}}}\uc2 , KPCB XVII, which closed last year.\par \par \uc2 All other Kleiner GPs at the firm are staying, but several more junior investment professionals have moved on.\par \par \uc2 Three partners who led Kleiner's seed-stage program called KPCB Edge\u8212\'20\'14Anjney Midha, Ruby Lee, and Roneil Rumburg\u8212\'20\'14have left the firm.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Shabih Rizvi, who focused on consumer investments at Kleiner, is now a founding partner at Gradient Ventures, \uc2 Google\uc2 's \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  fund. Also gone are Alex Tran, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker who had been a Kleiner partner since 2012, and Paul Yeh, who focused on hardware and sustainable technology investments at Kleiner since 2014.\par \par \uc2 "There's no common denominator theme to extract from this," said Amanda Duckworth, Kleiner Perkins' spokeswoman, about the string of departures at the firm. In addition to its GPs, the firm has seven remaining investment professionals, down from a dozen.\par \par \uc2 "We are not exiting the seed market," Ms. Duckworth said adding that Kleiner made six seed deals this year. "We have wound down Edge, but we continue very much to seed invest."\par \par \uc2 Edge was phased out at the end of last year as "the venture partners wanted to pull it back into the venture fund and not have a separate brand strategy for it," Ms. Duckworth said. The program had backed 15 startups, including Voodoo Manufacturing, TheWaveVR, and Abundant Robotics.\par \par \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2  has been going through a leadership transition. Several of its longtime investment partners have stepped back into advisory roles, including \uc2 Brook Byers\uc2 , \uc2 Randy Komisar\uc2  and \uc2 Ray Lane\uc2 . \uc2 John Doerr\uc2 , meanwhile, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-doerr-to-become-kleiner-perkinss-first-chairman-1459454815"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 became chairman of the firm }}}\uc2 last year, moving away from day-to-day operations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Abbott, who had joined Kleiner in 2011, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that he plans to get "back to focusing entirely on helping to develop and build products," instead of investing in companies.\par \par \uc2 At Kleiner Mr. Abbott focused on social, mobile and cloud computing sectors. He was involved with Kleiner portfolio companies including Airware, AngelList, Codecademy, Dollar Shave Club, and others. Ms. Duckworth said that other partners will take over his board seats.\par \par \uc2 "Mike has been a great partner during his time at \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2 . We wish him much success in his future endeavors," said a statement from \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Beth Seidenberg\uc2 , \uc2 Ted Schlein\uc2 , \uc2 Eric Feng\uc2  and Wen Hsieh are the remaining general partners in Kleiner's early-stage fund. The firm also manages a $1 billion Digital Growth Fund, closed last year.

These now cost the same as national payments. But retail banking in Europe is still divided along national borders, much like mobile roaming was until recently. (Until this year, consumers paid extra to use their phones in other EU countries.) With banking, a German vacationing in Croatia, which doesn't use the euro, might be hit by additional fees when using an ATM.\par \par \uc2 "I want to make sure that all Europeans pay less when transferring money abroad or taking money out of cash machines during their holidays\u8212\'20\'14no matter which currency they use or where they are in the EU," Mr. Dombrovskis said.\par \par \uc2 His move last week shows he plans to focus on passing financial regulation that would harmonize Europe's retail-banking landscape.\par \par \uc2 The bloc's financial-services chief celebrated his first anniversary in office in July. With two years left in his mandate, the clock is ticking: Any new legislative proposals that would shape the EU's financial regulation agenda will have to be made before year-end. In the EU lawmaking system, the majority of rules need to be approved by the member states and the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14which can take years.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Dombrovskis, Brexit-related work has eaten up some manpower and resources. His team had to come up with a politically sensitive proposal that could allow EU authorities to force clearinghouses that do a large chunk of business in euros to move into the bloc, as the majority of euro clearing takes place in London.\par \par \uc2 The commissioner is also grappling with debt-laden Italian banks as well as spats among European authorities trying to grab business from London after Brexit. Mr. Dombrovskis is reviewing the bloc's supervisory systems to curb EU countries in luring London finance firms by offering sweeteners such as less regulation. He expects to launch a proposal on the matter in September.\par \par \uc2 People close to the commissioner say he is pragmatic and stays on course. As prime minister of Latvia during the financial crisis, Mr. Dombrovskis refused to devalue the country's currency, the lats, and pursued deep budget cuts. That paved the way for the country to join the euro in 2014.\par \par \uc2 He is now plowing ahead with non-Brexit-related initiatives in retail banking and fintech.\par \par \uc2 "Fintech is a new area where we want Europe to be a major player, so creating a framework where companies in Europe can scale up, stay in Europe, and compete globally," Mr. Dombrovskis said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. "We are considering concrete initiatives there."\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Regulator Won't Seek Delay of CFPB's Arbitration Rule\par \par \uc2 By Yuka Hayashi\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A top financial regulator installed by the Trump administration said Monday he wouldn't seek to delay a new rule on arbitration agreements, skirting a showdown with another agency.\par \par \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , acting comptroller of the currency, was previously considering asking the \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2 , a board of top regulators, to temporarily halt the rule, citing concerns that the regulation could threaten the stability of the broad financial system.\par \par \uc2 The arbitration rule, unveiled by the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  on July 10, makes it easier for consumers to band together and sue banks, by prohibiting the use of clauses in financial services agreements to force consumers into arbitrations to resolve disputes.\par \par \uc2 Amid strong industry opposition to the rule, Republican lawmakers are seeking to repeal it using a legislative tool called the congressional Review Act.\par \par \uc2 "Given that Congress is considering use of the congressional Review Act to overturn the CFPB's final rule, I will not petition the FSOC to stay the effective date of the rule," Mr. Noreika said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noreika had been pursuing another route to thwart the rule: mobilizing the FSOC's authority to issue a temporary delay of a rule. The group made up of federal regulators monitors the health of the financial system and includes the heads of the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  and the CFPB.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noreika's announcement came after the deadline to file a petition with the FSOC passed on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 The acting OCC chief said the agency's economists would continue to review the impact of the arbitration rule. After receiving a set of requested data from the CFPB, Mr. Noreika has asked for more information from the agency, headed by Director \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2 , an Obama appointee.\par \par \uc2 "Nothing so far diminishes my concerns that the rule may adversely affect the institutions within the federal banking system and their customers," Mr. Noreika said.\par \par \uc2 Can \u8216\'20\'18the Mooch' Return to Wall Street?\par \par \uc2 By Rob Copeland and Lisa Beilfuss\par \par \uc2 Anthony Scaramucci is out as White House communications director. Can he come back to Wall Street?\par \par \uc2 On the Street, where Mr. Scaramucci is known as "the Mooch," he ran a firm that invests in hedge funds and started a popular hedge-fund conference in Las Vegas known as SALT.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scaramucci lost his White House role Monday just ten days after his appointment, ending a brief tenure that included a profanity-laced interview in which he insulted several administration staffers.\par \par \uc2 In January, Mr. Scaramucci agreed to sell a controlling stake in his hedge-fund investing firm, \uc2 SkyBridge Capital\uc2 , to Chinese giant \uc2 HNA Group Co\uc2 . and investment partner RON Transatlantic EG. The deal values SkyBridge at around $200 million, according to people familiar with the situation. The deal is currently facing a review by the \uc2 Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The company says it has $11.4 billion under management or advisement as of May 31, down from $11.8 billion at the end of January.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scaramucci's agreement to sell SkyBridge surprised many in the industry, given that several similar firms earlier tried to find buyers to no avail. The decline in assets at SkyBridge, coupled with broader lack of interest in hedge funds overall, suggests it's unlikely Mr. Scaramucci would walk away from a deal.\par \par \uc2 In one way, the deal could be less beneficial for him now. In general, employees of the executive branch are eligible to defer capital-gains taxes incurred on asset sales done to join an administration conflict-free. Without a job in the executive branch, that deferral would be in jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 "The deal remains on track. There is no intention to terminate," a spokesman for HNA said. The deal "is not contingent on Anthony Scaramucci's job," he said. He said he expects the transaction to close in the next month, "plus or minus a week."\par \par \uc2 A representative for SkyBridge said the deal remains on track and declined to comment about Mr. Scaramucci.\par \par \uc2 After the sale agreement in January, SkyBridge said in a statement that Mr. Scaramucci would "no longer be affiliated with SkyBridge or SALT." The conference brings together many of the biggest names in hedge funds, politics and entertainment. It also functions as a weeklong advertisement for SkyBridge.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scaramucci gave up his ownership stake as part of the deal.\par \par \uc2 Four months later, Mr. Scaramucci was omnipresent at the annual confab, much as he was in years past. He hosted private dinners for big name speakers and sponsors, conducted on-stage interviews and mingled with more than 1,000 attendees.\par \par \uc2 Months ago, after Mr. Scaramucci lost a post originally promised to him, he started laying the groundwork for a possible new venture in the event he didn't wind up in Washington. A person familiar with his thinking said he was considering starting an asset-management firm aimed at individual investors, in partnership with Jon Najarian, co-founder of Najarian Family Office and frequent CNBC commentator.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Kate O'Keeffe contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Goldman Finds Itself in Unusual Spot: Last Place in Trading\par \par \uc2 By Liz Hoffman\par \par \uc2 After catching a tennis match at Wimbledon in July, \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . trading chief \uc2 Pablo Salame\uc2  paid a visit to the London offices of bond-fund giant \uc2 Pacific Investment Management Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 His message to the Goldman client: "How can we do better?" according to people briefed on the July meeting.\par \par \uc2 The next day, Goldman reported quarterly trading numbers that were the worst on Wall Street. Those followed a disappointing first quarter in which Goldman failed to catch an upswing in debt trading reported by rivals.\par \par \uc2 A 40% decline in fixed-income activity, which includes bonds traded by Pimco and its ilk, left Goldman with first-half trading revenue that trailed its major banking rivals\u8212\'20\'14a first since Goldman went public in 1999.\par \par \uc2 The slump has rattled executives, sparking a charm offensive designed to showcase a more customer-friendly Goldman, focused on solving clients' problems rather than steering them into trades that benefit the firm's bottom line.\par \par \uc2 It has also tipped the scales in favor of more immediate action at the firm, despite a yearslong debate around whether changing market conditions were temporary or deep-rooted and how aggressively Goldman should respond to them.\par \par \uc2 "It could be secular, it could be cyclical, doesn't matter, who knows?" finance chief R. Martin Chavez said last month on the bank's earnings call. The bottom line: the firm has to go where its clients want to go.\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive \uc2 Lloyd Blankfein\uc2 , himself a former trader, has scheduled one-on-one meetings with some of the firm's top traders, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Senior executives and salespeople have fanned out to top clients, pitching trade ideas and talking down the bad quarter, according to people on both sides of the outreach.\par \par \uc2 The firm also is leaning on its investment bankers to pitch their corporate clients on hiring Goldman's traders for products that protect against swings in currency values and interest rates.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Goldman is working with a financial-data company to better understand what percent of each client's trading business it is getting, and how it can sell more products to existing clients, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Trading is the engine that has historically powered Goldman. The firm led the development of the institutional stock-trading market in the 1960s and dominated it for decades. In the 2000s, it was at the forefront of an explosion of complex debt instruments that ushered in a golden age of Wall Street profits.\par \par \uc2 \u8203\'20\'0BEven after postcrisis declines, trading still accounts for almost half of Goldman's revenue.\par \par \uc2 Big banks make fees by arranging trades for clients, ranging from simple corporate bonds to complex derivatives\u8203\'20\'0B tied to interest rates or currency prices.\par \par \uc2 The more complex \u8203\'20\'0Binstruments, which are often used by active investors like hedge funds, \u8203\'20\'0Bcommand higher fees. Plain-vanilla products are \u8203\'20\'0Ba low-margin, high-volume game.\par \par \uc2 Market and regulatory changes since the financial crisis have hit Goldman especially hard. Regulations closed its proprietary desks, which once made billions of dollars betting with the firm's own money.\par \par \uc2 A steadily rising stock market has also pushed investors away from risky investments and toward simpler products \u8203\'20\'0Bwhere giant banks such as \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . dominate.\par \par \uc2 Goldman's trading desk, by contrast, has been more geared toward hedge funds\u8212\'20\'14which have been less active as they face outflows and more trading moves to exchanges.\par \par \uc2 "The business changed around them," said \uc2 James Mitchell\uc2 , an analyst with Buckingham Research Group. "If you're a hedge fund and you're worried about investors pulling money next quarter, are you really going to be asking Goldman to build you a five-year yen swap?"\par \par \uc2 The shifting ground caused consternation within Goldman. In March 2016, a fixed-income sales executive, Tom Cornacchia, spoke publicly of an internal split between those who believed the business had changed for good and those betting on a return to the past.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cornacchia cast himself in the former camp, which felt the firm needed to adapt. The executive\u8212\'20\'14who left the firm last September\u8212\'20\'14said he had urged salespeople to be more patient and more client-focused, not to expect to land a trade with every phone call.\par \par \uc2 For a firm that has long hunted big game\u8212\'20\'14and where bonuses are set by "gross credits" that correspond to an employee's revenue generation\u8212\'20\'14that was uncomfortable for some, Mr. Cornacchia said.

Instead, long-term rates fell relative to short-term ones, and the dollar slid in March.\par \par \uc2 In the second quarter, the culprit was the commodities unit, which posted its worst three-month stretch in Goldman's 18 years as a public company.\u8203\'20\'0B The business ended the quarter in the black, \u8203\'20\'0Bbut barely, as the bank struggled to adequately hedge its inventory, according to people familiar with the results.\par \par \uc2 Goldman has responded by turbocharging a push\u8212\'20\'14begun about two years ago\u8212\'20\'14to court mutual funds, asset managers and other so-called "real money accounts."

Less support from Frankfurt will shift the onus onto national governments to help drive economic growth in the 19-nation currency union.\par \par \uc2 European governments can be fined up to 0.1% of gross domestic product if they repeatedly fail to address economic flaws flagged by EU authorities under a new risk-monitoring system launched during the region's recent debt crisis. The system, known as the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, aims to prevent worrisome economic developments such as high current-account deficits, unsustainable debt levels and house-price bubbles.\par \par \uc2 In practice, though, the EU has so far stopped short of issuing such sanctions.\par \par \uc2 But the ECB suggested that should change. "There seems to be a strong case for applying the corrective arm of this procedure for all countries with excessive imbalances," the central bank said.\par \par \uc2 EU policy recommendations typically address issues such as boosting the sustainability of public finances, reducing the tax burden on labor, and increasing the efficiency of public administration and state-owned enterprises.\par \par \uc2 ECB President Mario Draghi frequently scolds eurozone governments for their failure to implement reforms that could bolster the region's growth rate and lower unemployment. At a news conference 10 days ago, Mr. Draghi warned that the pace of reforms "needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost productivity growth."\par \par \uc2 The ECB has launched sweeping stimulus measures in recent years in an effort to support lending and growth in the currency bloc, to drive up inflation, which has hovered around zero. The bank is currently buying \u8364\'20\'AC60 billion ($70.4 billion) a month of eurozone bonds under its quantitative easing program, which is due to run through December.\par \par \uc2 But policy makers are expected to start reducing QE early next year, as the eurozone economy picks up speed.\par \par \uc2 The number of countries in which EU authorities have identified "excessive imbalances" is at an all-time high, according to the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , the EU's executive arm. They include Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal.\par \par \uc2 The commission said in February that for more than 90% of its 2016 recommendations, there had been only "some," "limited" or "no" progress on implementation, while only a very small number of recommendations had been "substantially" or "fully" implemented.\par \par \uc2 That failure "is all the more concerning given the remaining rigidities and vulnerabilities in euro area countries," the ECB said.\par \par \uc2 The use of financial sanctions for offending governments "offers a well-defined process ensuring greater traction on reform implementation for the most vulnerable member states," the central bank said.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin's Civil War: What You Need to Know\par \par \uc2 By Paul Vigna\par \par \uc2 This week, after years of industry infighting, the digital currency bitcoin is set to get a new competitor: itself.\par \par \uc2 A splinter group of bitcoin developers is launching a new version of the currency with a different configuration, the latest twist in a political quarrel for control over the network that controls bitcoin's trading.\par \par \uc2 But the new experiment, known as Bitcoin Cash, is causing confusion as exchanges and brokerages scramble to deal with the new currency.\par \par \uc2 The new bitcoin is slated to be launched Tuesday, a retaliation against a somewhat controversial July agreement in the industry that concerned expanding the bitcoin trading network. As a result, there will now be two competing versions of bitcoin, both vying for the support of investors, developers, and miners. Miners are companies and individuals that process bitcoin transactions\par \par \uc2 While bitcoin is known as a currency, its core is software, an open-source project initially supported by volunteers and technology enthusiasts. Because the software is open-source, anybody can copy it and release their own version.\par \par \uc2 The prospects for the new bitcoin are uncertain, and it isn't clear who exactly is behind it. A website for Bitcoin Cash says it is backed by a "group of miners, developers, investors, and bitcoin users" who previously were pushing for a split before the July compromise.\par \par \uc2 One large mining-equipment company, Bitmain, based in Beijing, was spearheading the split effort. The firm is still supporting the July compromise, but said it did "not rule out" supporting Bitcoin Cash, assuming it survives. Additionally, Roger Ver, a prominent bitcoin investor, has been publicly supporting Bitcoin Cash.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ver said he didn't know about Bitcoin Cash until it was announced July 22, but is enthusiastic about its prospects. "I think it fits the original vision of bitcoin," he said.\par \par \uc2 One exchange, China-based ViaBTC, which is partially owned by Bitmain, is already allowing users to trade Bitcoin Cash in accounts that would be redeemable once the currency goes live.\par \par \uc2 In very illiquid trading)\u8212\'20\'14fewer than 1,900 bitcoins over 24 hours\u8212\'20\'14the price of Bitcoin Cash was at 0.0951 bitcoin, or about $266 on Monday morning. Bitcoin was trading at $2,801.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear what volume and prices will look like once live trading begins, scheduled for 8:20 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, bitcoin exchanges are scrambling to figure how they will either support Bitcoin Cash or won't, and protect their customer accounts at the same time.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, the U.S. exchange \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  said in a statement that it wouldn't support Bitcoin Cash, on the reasoning that it wasn't clear how long the rebel currency would last and what market value it would have. It advised customers who wanted to access Bitcoin Cash to withdraw their bitcoin before July 31.\par \par \uc2 Another exchange, San Francisco-based Kraken, conditionally said it would support Bitcoin Cash trading, assuming it was successfully launched, and would credit its customer accounts with an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash.\par \par \uc2 The group behind Bitcoin Cash is copying bitcoin's software, adding a couple of new features, and releasing it to the public. It will be an almost identical copy, and anybody who has a bitcoin balance can automatically hold the exact same amount of Bitcoin Cash. The balances from the original to the new version will be copied on a 1:1 basis, and it will exist as of Aug. 1.\par \par \uc2 Whether or not users get access to the new coin depends. If a user has control over their "wallet," or online account, they can spend their existing balance anywhere either currency is accepted.\par \par \uc2 Some wallet services, like \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , act as a custodian for users, meaning the decision on whether an existing balance could be spent on Bitcoin Cash is up to the company.\par \par \uc2 Whether this new money retains any value or collapses though will depend upon whether exchanges support it, and users adopt it. If they don't, it could die quickly.\par \par \uc2 The main difference between bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is how fast it trades and how many trades can happen in a short amount of time.\par \par \uc2 On bitcoin, transactions are bundled into blocks that are limited to one megabyte in size, which means the network can process about seven transactions per second.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin Cash will have an eight megabyte maximum. It's an arcane coding issue, but it is the source of a major rift in the industry. On one side: developers who want to expand the system to compete against major payment companies. On the other: miners who prefer the status quo and fear big technology companies could be too dominant if speed and large trades take over.\par \par \uc2 "I think the idea is ill-advised," said Eric Lombrozo, a bitcoin developer and co-CEO of startup Ciphrex, "but do not wish them ill."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 UK Financial Reporting Council\uc2  to Investigate Mitie Audits\par \par \uc2 UK Financial Reporting Council\uc2  said it has opened an investigation into \uc2 Deloitte LLP\uc2 's audit of the financial statements of \uc2 Mitie Group PLC\uc2 , a British outsourcing and energy management firm.

Nauto Inc. Brain Corp. Plenty Inc. And soon, perhaps, \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In just the past few weeks alone, a flurry of deals in the nine- and ten-figure range all feature the name of one investor time and again: \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 's presence on the venture-capital scene has varied for at least 20 years, but it hasn't invested at this pace in almost two decades.\par \par \uc2 Armed with $93 billion raised from outside limited partners, the Vision Fund is poised to play the part that mutual funds like Fidelity, \uc2 T. Rowe Price\uc2  and BlackRock had in pouring cash into startups in 2014 and 2015. That turn of events, coming after a pullback in of late-stage funding, has raised the prospects of an easy-money resurgence for Silicon Valley's big tech names\u8212\'20\'14and their valuations, which dipped in 2016 after mutual funds scaled back on investing.\par \par \uc2 Already, since the mammoth Vision Fund began laying down bets this year, median valuations have shot back up, even surpassing previous levels, according to data from VentureSource.\par \par \uc2 "They're taking the place of the nontraditional VC investors, like mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.," said Felice Egidio, a research analyst with Preqin who oversees venture coverage. "Valuations started to normalize a bit. Now it's starting to come back around."\par \par \uc2 In the first tech boom he helped unleash, SoftBank founder \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2  mostly backed software companies, including some of the first high-profile internet businesses, such as \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  and Match.com.\par \par \uc2 This time he says he's on the hunt for the technologies\u8212\'20\'14across all fields\u8212\'20\'14that will power the future. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 's next-generation portfolio companies span agriculture, real estate, cancer research, robotics and more.\par \par \uc2 "The Vision Fund is not about taking on the world with one specific technology, business model or brand," Mr. Son said onstage at a July event in Tokyo. "It's about people sharing the same vision coming together to start a revolution."\par \par \uc2 To date, SoftBank, which declined to comment for this article, owns a strong investment record, citing an annual rate of return of 44% over the past 18 years. That includes a few spectacular investments, like its bet in 2000 on China's Alibaba.\par \par \uc2 Yet SoftBank's cash pile has been striking for big stakes, often surpassing $100 million in deals. Those large checks will mean late-stage investors face more competition for deals\u8212\'20\'14at higher valuations.\par \par \uc2 So far SoftBank has led two nine-figure financing deals directly out of the Vision Fund: a $114 million round for Brain Corp., a startup that makes robots empowered with vision sensors and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to navigate their environment; the other was a $200 million funding of indoor agriculture startup Plenty. In the past few months, SoftBank as a corporation has done many more marquee deals\u8212\'20\'14like ARM, OneWeb, \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 , \uc2 Social Finance\uc2 , \uc2 Improbable Worlds\uc2  and WeWork Cos.--that could be transferred to the Vision Fund portfolio down the road.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 's bold return to venture investing has set off a debate about its potential effect. Early-stage investors are downright thrilled that there is another source of capital to help their companies grow. Late-stage investors may be more conflicted, as they compete with SoftBank for deals.\par \par \uc2 "A fund like this might be able to have its pick of the later-stage businesses that might need a little more capital but might need that to get to profitability," said Rob Siegel, a professor at \uc2 Stanford's Graduate School of Business\uc2  and a partner at XSeed Capital. "I actually think this is going to help later-stage companies stay alive."\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  has shown a particular interest in ride-hailing businesses, where it appears to be {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-boosts-bet-on-ride-hailing-with-play-for-stake-in-uber-1501006584"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 hedging its bets}}}\uc2 . \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  holds big stakes in the three largest Asian ride-hailing companies: Singapore's \uc2 GrabTaxi Holdings\uc2  Pte., India's Ola and China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co. Now it is even {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-seeks-multibillion-dollar-stake-in-uber-1500958957"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 angling}}}\uc2  to take a multibillion-dollar stake in Uber.\par \par \uc2 "Timing-wise, it's actually great, because many of these big mutual funds are slowing down. It's going to be filling the void left by the mutual funds," said \uc2 David Chao\uc2 , a co-founder and general partner at \uc2 DCM Ventures\uc2 , a firm that has made several co-investments with SoftBank, including in Plenty. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  has also been a limited partner in DCM funds.\par \par \uc2 Yet even as the Vision Fund provides companies much-needed cash, it could set up a conflict with heavyweight venture firms who fear getting squeezed out of big deals.\par \par \uc2 This has already irked some investors, as in the case of Plenty's recent funding.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 SoftBank\uc2  wanted a certain percentage of the company. And therefore, there were funds that couldn't get in," Mr. Chao explained. "The guys who write big checks feel a little pressure because there's another kid in town."\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  aims to hold a sizable stake\u8212\'20\'14often about 30%--in most of the companies it backs, Mr. Chao said. This can mean asking the company to give up a large share of ownership, or can mean asking other investors to sell SoftBank some or all of their shares.\par \par \uc2 For SoftBank's recent round in Nauto, a driverless technology startup, it meant compromise. "The investors took a little bit smaller stake than they may have wanted," said Stefan Heck, Nauto's chief executive. "We took a little bit more dilution."\par \par \uc2 Write to Patience Haggin at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:patience.haggin@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 patience.haggin@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170801ed81000dz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

These now cost the same as national payments. But retail banking in Europe is still divided along national borders, much like mobile roaming was until recently. (Until this year, consumers paid extra to use their phones in other EU countries.) With banking, a German vacationing in Croatia, which doesn't use the euro, might be hit by additional fees when using an ATM.\par \par \uc2 "I want to make sure that all Europeans pay less when transferring money abroad or taking money out of cash machines during their holidays\u8212\'20\'14no matter which currency they use or where they are in the EU," Mr. Dombrovskis said.\par \par \uc2 His move last week shows he plans to focus on passing financial regulation that would harmonize Europe's retail-banking landscape.\par \par \uc2 The bloc's financial-services chief celebrated his first anniversary in office in July. With two years left in his mandate, the clock is ticking: Any new legislative proposals that would shape the EU's financial regulation agenda will have to be made before year-end. In the EU lawmaking system, the majority of rules need to be approved by the member states and the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14which can take years.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Dombrovskis, Brexit-related work has eaten up some manpower and resources. His team had to come up with a politically sensitive proposal that could allow EU authorities to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-derivatives-proposal-may-save-businesses-billions-1493898085"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 force clearinghouses that do a large chunk of business in euros to move}}}\uc2  into the bloc, as the majority of euro clearing takes place in London.\par \par \uc2 The commissioner is also grappling with debt-laden Italian banks as well as spats among European authorities trying to grab business from London after Brexit. Mr. Dombrovskis is reviewing the bloc's supervisory systems to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-sets-guidelines-for-members-luring-london-finance-firms-after-brexit-1496227727"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 curb EU countries in luring London finance firms by offering sweeteners}}}\uc2  such as less regulation. He expects to launch a proposal on the matter in September.\par \par \uc2 People close to the commissioner say he is pragmatic and stays on course. As prime minister of Latvia during the financial crisis, Mr. Dombrovskis refused to devalue the country's currency, the lats, and pursued deep budget cuts. That paved the way for the country to join the euro in 2014.\par \par \uc2 He is now plowing ahead with non-Brexit-related initiatives in retail banking and fintech.\par \par \uc2 "Fintech is a new area where we want Europe to be a major player, so creating a framework where companies in Europe can scale up, stay in Europe, and compete globally," Mr. Dombrovskis said {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-q-a-with-valdis-dombrovskis-1499620479"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in an interview with The Wall Street Journal}}}\uc2 .

Can he come back to Wall Street?\par \par \uc2 On the Street, where Mr. Scaramucci is known as "the Mooch," he ran a firm that invests in hedge funds and started a popular hedge-fund conference in Las Vegas known as SALT.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scaramucci lost his White House role Monday just 10 days after his appointment, ending a brief tenure that included a profanity-laced interview in which he insulted several administration staffers.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/scaramucci-removed-as-white-house-communications-director-1501526781"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  Scaramucci Removed as White House Communications Director at Kelly's Urging }}}\par \par \uc2 Goldman Finds Itself in Unusual Spot: Last Place in Trading\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-finds-itself-in-unusual-spot-last-place-in-trading-1501579804"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s}}}\uc2  40% decline in fixed-income activity has rattled executives, sparking a charm offensive designed to showcase a more customer-friendly Goldman.\par \par \uc2 Market and regulatory changes since the financial crisis have hit Goldman especially hard.

Capital-adequacy ratios, at 11% on average, might look healthy, above the minimum requirement of 7.5% to 9%, depending on bank size. But regulators have been tightening rules, including forcing banks to bring more off-balance-sheet assets onto their books. That will likely {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-banks-dash-for-capital-gets-under-way-1501488927"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 force more banks to raise capital}}}\uc2  to keep their ratios robust.\par \par \uc2 With Chinese banks trading at 60% to 70% of their book value, raising equity is tricky, one reason Chinese banks have raised $100 billion of debt this year, up 20% on last year. Such funding is getting more expensive and ultimately won't help absorb losses. A conversion to convertible bonds could prove lasting. While convertibles don't count as equity straight away, they could help improve a lender's equity levels when they are turned into stock.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday, Aug. 1\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Finance Committee {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/americas-affordable-housing-crisis-challenges-and-solutions"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 holds a hearing}}}\uc2  on the challenges behind and solutions to America's affordable housing market.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday, Aug. 2\par \par \uc2 11 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://43rdcbaoconvention.splashthat.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 gives a speech}}}\uc2  at the Community Bankers Association of Ohio annual convention in Cincinnati.\par \par \uc2 Thursday, Aug. 3\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2vY47Sh"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 holds a hearing}}}\uc2  on insurance fraud in America.\par \par \uc2 Postcrisis Policies Drive Housing Inequality\par \par \uc2 Housing inequality has worsened since the 2008 financial crisis, despite trillions of dollars in affordable-housing subsidies, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2uQmRD8"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a paper by Karen Shaw Petrou}}}\uc2 , managing partner of \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT\par {\*\bkmkstart toc21}{\*\bkmkend toc21}\b \uc2 In active fund management, churn is not necessarily burn; VIEWPOINT\b0\par\par\uc2 By Duncan Lamont \par \uc2 692 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 July 2017\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 Surveys FNM1\par 09\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

However, what appears common sense at first glance can turn out to be totally wrong on closer inspection. One aspect of the active/passive debate risks falling into this trap. The final report by the \uc2 UK's Financial Conduct Authority\uc2 , the regulator, on the asset management industry rightly champions value for money but states that it was wrong to interpret their findings as suggesting passive funds are better than active.\par \par \uc2 The thorny issue of transaction costs has drawn the ire of many. Every time a fund manager buys or sells a share they incur transaction costs. More frequent trading, or higher turnover, increases those transaction costs. In a world fixated on costs, it is easy to make the leap and assume that funds with higher turnover generate worse outcomes for investors. Conventional wisdom is overpowering on this front, but it is also wrong.\par \par \uc2 Of course it is true that high turnover might indicate low conviction or short-termism, and trading too often does eat into the returns an active fund delivers for investors. However, it is unfair to suggest that all turnover is bad. If a fund manager sells a stock that subsequently underperforms and replaces it with another that outperforms then the impact on performance should be positive, even after allowing for transaction costs. Conversely, if they hold on to stocks that have been underperforming then this could be a sign of a portfolio based on stale views.\par \par \uc2 We have spent some time analysing the link between portfolio turnover and excess returns among US-domiciled active equity funds and our research dispels this myth. We found no evidence of a structural relationship between turnover and excess returns among active US equity funds over the 1991-2016 period.\par \par \uc2 Statistical analysis confirms the lack of relationship. This conclusion holds over both one- and three-year investment horizons.\par \par \uc2 Past performance is not a guide to future performance and may not be repeated.\par \par \uc2 What may be more surprising is that we found no evidence of any relationship across all other styles of US equity fund, even in small-caps where the costs of trading are noticeably higher. On average, high turnover US equity funds have been able to add at least enough value to offset the additional transaction costs they incur. The moral is that pursuing a reduction in transaction costs without considering the consequences is misguided. Consistency between investment process and turnover is more important than the level of turnover.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, it is just as wrong to focus this aspect of the debate on active funds. Smart beta indices, the current darling of the investment universe, experience much higher levels of turnover than traditional equity indices.\par \par \uc2 But active managers are not out of the woods yet. Emerging market equity funds with consistently higher turnover have, on average, tended to underperform their lower-turnover rivals. The best-performing emerging market equity funds also typically have lower turnover.\par \par \uc2 And if you're going to invest in a fund with a process that results in higher turnover, you had better choose wisely. The best high-turnover US equity funds outperform the best low-turnover funds, but the worst do worse and high-turnover funds have a statistically significant lower survival rate. Get it right and the gains may be higher, but get it wrong and the downside is also greater.\par \par \uc2 This issue gets to the heart of the debate on asset management. It has become wholly focused on costs, where cheaper is assumed to be better. But there are good high-cost funds and there are bad high-cost funds. That's not to downplay the challenge of selecting an active fund manager who will outperform but a single-minded focus on cost is unlikely to be the best response. In the \uc2 FCA\uc2 's words, investors should focus on value for money.\par \par \uc2 Duncan Lamont is head of research and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , the UK's largest listed asset manager.

It has also attracted 213,000 new retail customers over the past 12 months. Union's assets under management rose 12.4 per cent year on year to reach \u8364\'20\'AC310bn at the end of June.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 \uc2 Daniel Loeb\uc2 , founder of Third Point, the activist hedge fund manager, has acquired a stake in \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , even though shares in the world's largest asset manager reached an all-time high this month.\par \par \uc2 Mr Loeb said \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  was "a misunderstood franchise" and that its shares were severely undervalued, given the explosive growth of its iShares ETF business and data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  services.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Cerberus has acquired a \u8364\'20\'AC675m stake in \uc2 Commerzbank\uc2 , setting up a potential clash between the US private equity manager and the \uc2 German government\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 German government\uc2  owns just over 15 per cent of the bank since its bailout during the 2007-08 global financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Berlin is unlikely to look favourably on any attempt by a US private equity group to put pressure on its strategy.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Britain's financial regulator plans to strengthen rules governing top managers at thousands of financial companies in a drive to make individuals more accountable for their conduct. The so-called senior managers regime, which has applied to banks for just over a year, is to be extended to cover all parts of the UK's financial services industry, including investment managers.\par \par \uc2 Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, the UK trade body for asset managers, cautioned that the new rules would arrive at a challenging time for many companies.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170731ed7v0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The company, based in Toronto, helps online retailers manage product information.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zifkin says he is only half-joking. But his message is part of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/campaigns/global-skills-strategy.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a coordinated push for talent}}}\uc2  by Canadian executives, government officials and venture capitalists to pounce on what they see as a rare opportunity for the nation's maturing tech sector.\par \par \uc2 "A year ago, the only people I could talk to were ex-Canadians who missed home, but the talent was lacking," said Mr. Zifkin, who returned last month from a recruiting trip in the San Francisco Bay Area. There, he met with 20 candidates for senior management positions. "This time it's much better."\par \par \uc2 The effort comes as the Trump administration in April {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-order-calling-for-changes-in-h-1b-visa-rules-1492558473"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 launched a review}}}\uc2  aimed at stricter enforcement of immigration rules and other laws governing entry of workers into the U.S. Any changes could affect thousands of foreigners on H1-B visas, widely used to employ high-skilled workers in the U.S. tech and other white-collar sectors.\par \par \uc2 "You're running a startup. You're involved in one of the most uncertain businesses of all time," Ray Sharma, CEO of Extreme Venture Partners, says he tells tech founders who aren't U.S. citizens but are living in the U.S. or considering it. "Now you're introducing your residency as part of that uncertainty? That's crazy."\par \par \uc2 Extreme Venture\uc2 , a venture-capital firm based in Toronto, helps relocate startups based in the U.S. and elsewhere to Canada and assists in securing Canadian citizenship for employees.\par \par \uc2 "It's such an easy sell sometimes," said Mr. Sharma. "It's like, 'You had me at Canada.'"\par \par \uc2 One taker was fulfil.io, a cloud-based software platform that aids companies in their supply-chain operations. Two of the company's founders decided to come to Canada in May from their native India after they had to leave the U.S. when their H1-B visas expired and renewal proved difficult. They closed their first sales deal a month later.\par \par \uc2 "Canada looks like the right place to grow," said one, Sharoon Thomas, fulfil.io CEO. "I'm just surprised that we didn't think of it first."\par \par \uc2 It can still be difficult to poach engineers and programmers from Silicon Valley, where large tech firms such as \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . reign. There, the salaries are higher, the venture-capital sector bigger and the winters warmer.\par \par \uc2 Meredith Trotter, a data scientist at Lumiata Inc., an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm in San Mateo, Calif., said she has plans to return to her native Canada but hasn't found anything superior to her current job that would compel her to make the move now. "Even when those jobs start becoming real, I'm not sure I'll be ready to go home," Ms. Trotter said.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, it could take as much as a year for foreigners offered a job in Canada to receive a work permit, which immigration lawyer Joel Guberman said was "unworkable."\par \par \uc2 But last month, the \uc2 Canadian government\uc2  announced a pilot program aimed at cutting this kind of wait and the red tape involved. Under the program, work permits and temporary resident visas are issued in two weeks instead of one year.\par \par \uc2 Platterz Inc., an online-catering platform, has already used the government program for three new hires, two of whom arrived in Canada last week. "When we started, we had someone from the government call us every day to walk us through the process," said Eran Henig, CEO of the Toronto startup. "I never would have expected that kind of attention from the government."\par \par \uc2 Canada's stepped-up recruitment effort is getting under way at a time of expansion in its tech industry. Several startups such as \uc2 Shopify Inc\uc2 ., which develops software for online retailers, and \uc2 Real Matters Inc\uc2 ., a real-estate data and software firm, have launched initial public offerings in recent years. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-looks-to-develop-a-new-resource-artificial-intelligence-1490982372"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The country is becoming a key hub for \\b artificial intelligence\\b0 .}}}\uc2  Venture-capital investment hit a record in 2016, with C$3.7 billion ($3.0 billion) invested in 571 deals, with total value up 37% from the previous year, according to Thomson Reuters.\par \par \uc2 Despite the gains, that is still a fraction of similar types of investment activity in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Ontario, home to most of Canada's tech firms, plans to launch an ad campaign later this year targeting workers and executives in Silicon Valley. In November, Salim Teja, president of venture services for MaRS, a Toronto tech hub, was part of a group that paid to erect two billboards along U.S. Route 101 in Silicon Valley inviting residents to "Go North."\par \par \uc2 In a survey conducted this month, MaRS found that 17 high-growth companies out of 26 respondents said they have experienced a notable increase in people based in the U.S. applying for positions in Canada so far this year compared with 2016. \uc2 Shopify\uc2 , one of the respondents, said it saw a 40% increase over the 2016 average, although it noted it cannot attribute the increase to any specific cause.\par \par \uc2 "Companies are recognizing that the level of anxiety is becoming a factor in attracting talent," said Michael Tippett, co-founder of True North, a consulting firm that aids startups looking to open offices in Canada.\par \par \uc2 Write to David George-Cosh at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:david.george-cosh@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 david.george-cosh@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Jacquie McNish at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Jacquie.McNish@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jacquie.McNish@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-order-calling-for-changes-in-h-1b-visa-rules-1492558473"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Trump Signs Order Calling for Changes in H-1B Visa Rules}}}\uc2  (April 18)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-looks-to-develop-a-new-resource-artificial-intelligence-1490982372"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Canada Looks to Develop a New Resource: \\b Artificial Intelligence\\b0 }}}\uc2  (March 31)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-immigration-uncertainty-threatens-americas-tech-dominance-1486031582"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 KEYWORDS: How Immigration Uncertainty Threatens America's Tech Dominance}}}\uc2  (Feb. 2)\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170729ed7t0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The result? The government has left ordinary investors guessing about what exactly is going on. Amid the lack of transparency, speculation by China watchers has been rife.\par \par \uc2 It started in June, when officials asked banks to examine the borrowings of select companies including \uc2 Dalian Wanda Group\uc2 . The Chinese banking regulator signaled its concern over specific firms, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-say-beijing-enabled-unfair-trading-by-chinese-banks-1498663134"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 giving banks information the rest of the market didn't have}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14and an opportunity to pare any exposure they had in those firms.\par \par \uc2 Behind the scenes, a crackdown on select firms gathered momentum. Regulators {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-blocks-dalian-wanda-from-completing-overseas-deals-1500268091"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 advised big state-owned lenders to cut off lending to Wanda}}}\uc2 , a property and entertainment company, on a number of deals.\par \par \uc2 The market was left guessing what was happening.\par \par \uc2 When Beijing's moves were finally leaked to the public, investors only had more questions, including what was motivating the clampdown. Officials said publicly that some private businesses loaded up on too much debt to invest abroad. But state-owned firms that had also taken on debt to do the same weren't named.\par \par \uc2 The targeted firms\u8212\'20\'14Wanda, \uc2 HNA Group Co\uc2 ., Anbang Insurance Group and Fosun International Ltd.\u8212\'20\'14are privately owned and have reputations for cultivating political ties. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-latest-clampdown-on-overseas-investing-has-president-xis-approval-1500802203"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Wall Street Journal reported that President Xi Jinping personally signed off}}}\uc2  on sanctions against Wanda.\par \par \uc2 The investment community has been on edge, unclear about how far Beijing will go in reining in certain firms. A major question is how much of this is politically motivated.\par \par \uc2 Government authorities took away the chairman of Anbang in mid-June. Less than a month later, shares of Fosun's listed units tanked on rumors that its chairman, Guo Guangchang, had also disappeared.\par \par \uc2 It turned out that a Chinese financial information services platform called Hithink RoyalFlush Information Network Co. had accidentally published an old report saying that Fosun had lost contact with Mr. Guo. But the market chose to believe it.\par \par \uc2 The country's securities regulator had a fix: It {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/newsite/zjhxwfb/xwdd/201707/t20170721_320805.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 said Hithink "seriously misled investors" and levied a fine}}}\uc2  of 200,000 yuan (about $30,000) on the firm.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Guo sent a memo to Fosun employees, lamenting the spreading of rumors. He thanked the securities regulator for its action against Hithink and said no single government department should be responsible for improving such a situation.\par \par \uc2 Neither the regulator nor Mr. Guo addressed the root of investors' nervousness. In 2015, Mr. Guo had really been incommunicado as he {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fosun-listed-units-halted-amid-questions-about-founders-whereabouts-1449798047"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 participated in a government investigation}}}\uc2 . To this day, it isn't clear what Mr. Guo had been involved in.\par \par \uc2 The list of opaque moves by Beijing is getting longer. Far from communicating clearly with the market, the government has effectively treated investors like second-class citizens. Chinese banks appear to be getting some guidance, privy to some of the matters that motivate Beijing. Meanwhile, investors are left in the dark. They may never get their answers.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 U.K. Will Shut Down Scandal-Hit Libor\par \par \uc2 By Max Colchester\par \par \uc2 In five years' time Libor should be no more.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday a top U.K. regulator said it will phase out the London Interbank Offered Rate, a scandal-plagued benchmark that is used to set the price of trillions of dollars of loans across the world.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Bailey\uc2 , the chief executive of the U.K.'s \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2 , which regulates Libor, said Thursday that work will begin to plan for a transition to alternate benchmarks by the end of 2021. "We do not think markets can rely on Libor continuing to be available indefinitely," he said.\par \par \uc2 Libor is calculated every working day by polling major banks on their estimated borrowing costs. Its integrity was called into question following a rate-rigging scandal where traders at numerous banks were able to nudge it up or down by submitting false data. Banks were fined billions of dollars and several traders were sent to jail. Over the last five years regulators have tried to find ways to tie Libor submissions to actual trades, as opposed to estimations. But in several cases that proved impossible because inter-bank lending has hugely diminished, said Mr. Bailey.\par \par \uc2 In one case banks setting the Libor rate for one version of the benchmark executed just 15 transactions in that currency and duration for the whole of 2016, he said. The U.K. regulator has the power to compel banks to submit data to calculate the benchmark. "But we do not think it right to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit expert judgements indefinitely," he said, adding that many banks felt "discomfort" at the current set up. The FCA recently launched an exercise to gather data from 49 banks.\par \par \uc2 The rate, created in the early 1980s, was previously overseen by a British banking lobby group. During the financial crisis it was closely watched as a gauge of a bank's health. The lower other banks charged an institution to borrow, the safer it was deemed to be. The problem: bank lending largely froze up, so the Libor rate was based on guesses and in some cases on deliberately skewed data.\par \par \uc2 Following the rate-rigging scandal it was stripped of its control of the benchmark. In 2014 IBA, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, became the new administrator of Libor. The IBA implemented a series of changes\u8212\'20\'14including instating a surveillance team that evaluates the data coming out of the banks\u8212\'20\'14to ensure that the lenders' submissions are more accurate. A spokeswoman for the IBA declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 A group within the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  is working on potential replacements to Libor. Any shift will have to be phased in slowly.\par \par \uc2 Some \u163\'00\'A330 trillion ($39.4 trillion) of over the counter derivatives reference the rate, while dollar Libor contracts run to the hundreds of trillions, according to the central bank. One potential replacement is the Sterling Overnight Index Average, which is calculated using banks' overnight funding rates in the sterling unsecured market. This rate is currently being reformed by the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fed Nominee Quarles: Bank Rules Need \u8216\'20\'18Refinements'\par \par \uc2 By Andrew Ackerman and Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Postcrisis bank rules have made the financial system safer but need "some refinements," President Donald Trump's pick to become the Federal Reserve's point person on financial regulation plans to tell Senate lawmakers Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "As with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order," Randal Quarles is expected to tell lawmakers, according to a copy of his prepared remarks released late Wednesday by the Senate Banking Committee.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Quarles is set to testify Thursday before the panel along with Joseph Otting, nominated to become the Comptroller of the Currency.\par \par \uc2 The hearing is a crucial step to advance the nominees toward confirmation in the coming months. Both are expected to be given the green light by the Senate.\par \par \uc2 If confirmed, both would likely install more industry-friendly voices at the country's top bank regulators. The Trump administration already is conducting a review of Obama-era banking rules that it says go too far and curb lending.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Quarles, an investment-fund manager nominated earlier this month, would become Fed vice chairman of supervision, taking on a job created by Congress in 2010. That post was never formally filled, although former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo effectively served in the role. In addition to his work on financial regulation, Mr. Quarles would weigh in on monetary policy as a member of the Fed's board of governors. The seven-seat board is currently short-staffed, with only four members.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Quarles previously served in the Treasury Department in both Bush administrations. He left the government in 2006 and the following year he became a managing director at private-equity firm \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2 , investing in troubled banks. To join the Fed, he is leaving a job as managing director at Cynosure Group, a Utah investment firm backed by family offices, including the Eccles family, which Mr. Quarles married into.\par \par \uc2 In a March 2016 Wall Street Journal opinion column that he co-wrote, Mr. Quarles said he didn't support "arbitrarily taking an ax to big banks and irreparably damaging the economy." He endorsed a review of postcrisis regulations but warned that "the consequence of a dramatic increase in bank capital is an increase in the cost of bank credit."\par \par \uc2 Not much is known about Mr. Otting's regulatory views, though he is expected to adopt a similar tone to other Trump administration officials, who have called for a review of banking rules.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Otting has worked in banking for decades. In 2010, he was hired as chief executive of OneWest, now owned by \uc2 CIT Group\uc2 . At the time, he was a lieutenant of Treasury Secretary \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2 , who was chairman of OneWest. Among Mr. Otting's tasks was convincing regulators and community groups that the merger with \uc2 CIT\uc2  should proceed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Otting would succeed \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , the acting comptroller.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Transcript: Donald Trump Discusses Candidates for Top Fed Job\par \par \uc2 Wall Street Journal editors and reporters interviewed President Donald Trump on Tuesday, July 25, 2017, at the White House. The 45-minute interview took place in the Oval Office. Mr. Trump was joined by several of his senior staff, including his daughter Ivanka and \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , director of the National Economic Council. Here are edited excerpts of his comments on whether he might nominate Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen to serve a second term, and on other possible candidates for the central bank's top job.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: We're coming up very soon to the time to decide whether or not to reappoint Janet Yellen as the chair of the Federal Reserve or to appoint somebody else. Are you\u8212\'20\'14have you reached a decision?\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: I have a lot of respect for her, and I like her. I've met her just a couple of times, but I like her. It's early to make the decision.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Does that mean it's possible you would keep her?\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: I do like low interest rates. I mean, you know, I'm not making that a big secret. I think low interest rates are good. I like a dollar that's not too strong. I mean, I've seen strong dollars. And frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar.\u8230\'20\'26I would say yes, she is in the running to stay.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Is Gary [Cohn] a candidate? (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: He doesn't know this, but yes, he is. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Are there other candidates?\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: I actually think he likes what he's doing right now.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: That's what he tells us.\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: Don't tell Gary what I just said.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Are there other candidates?\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: Yeah, there are two or three. But she is\u8212\'20\'14she is in the running, absolutely. I like her. I like her demeanor. I think she's done a good job. I'd like to see rates stay low. She's always been\u8212\'20\'14you know, she's historically been a low-interest-rate person, a believer.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Do you have a time frame for announcing a decision?\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: I would say sometime by the end of year, probably.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: It would need a confirmation process, which will take time.\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: Yeah, but it'll go quickly.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: Are there other names you might offer who are in the mix for the Fed?\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: I'd rather not do that.\par \par \uc2 WSJ: (Former Fed governor) \uc2 Kevin Warsh\uc2  has been mentioned.\par \par \uc2 MR. TRUMP: I'd rather not get involved. But I would say she is, certainly. And Gary is somebody that I've gained great\u8212\'20\'14I've known Gary for a long time\u8212\'20\'14but I've gained great respect for Gary working with him.

On Thursday, \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . took a step toward growing its securities-based lending business through a new partnership with \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For brokerages, these so-called securities-backed loans have become a reliable source of revenue in the years since the financial crisis as firms have begun moving away from a business model of charging commissions for trading to a system of fees based on assets under management. The loans themselves help brokers retain these assets because customers don't have to sell stocks and other securities when they need cash. These loans have also become a big factor in brokers' compensation.\par \par \uc2 Clients, in turn, are able to borrow money at relatively low interest rates because the loans are secured.\par \par \uc2 But they could be left in the lurch if markets tank and the value of that collateral shrinks, prompting the bank to demand loan repayment. If a margin call isn't met, the securities backing the loans are sold and the borrower is responsible for any remaining balance.\par \par \uc2 These arrangements are structured to benefit the brokerage, with the client shouldering virtually all the risk, critics say. And these loan products are often pushed without regard to whether clients even need them, they add. Regulators are also taking notice.\par \par \uc2 Several Merrill Lynch brokers said they have asked longstanding clients to open securities-backed lines of credit to help them hit bonus hurdles, assuring that clients wouldn't need to use it or pay any fees for opening it. Merrill brokers receive ongoing payments for getting clients to tap credit lines, and those loan balances contribute to year-end bonus calculations, people familiar with matter said.\par \par \uc2 Brokerage executives have said the longer a client has one of these loans tied to their account, the more likely they are to use it.\par \par \uc2 "We were dramatically pushed to put these on all of our client accounts," said Steven Dudash, a former Merrill Lynch broker who has been managing his own investment-advisory firm since 2014. "Whenever you're product-pushing, it's not in the client's best interest."\par \par \uc2 Merrill representatives say its brokers offer these loans to clients in a responsible manner, including disclosing the risks and fees.\par \par \uc2 "If people need the money, they should sell securities," said Terrance Odean, a professor of finance at the \uc2 Haas School of Business\uc2  at \uc2 University of California, Berkeley\uc2 . "It's very risky to take a leveraged position in the market, and I don't think people are thinking about it that way."\par \par \uc2 A major concern of critics is that the boom in securities-backed lending has coincided with what is now the second-longest bull market on record in the U.S. They worry that investors, nearly a decade removed from the financial crisis, have become less wary of debt backed by investments as stock markets keep rising.\par \par \uc2 If U.S. markets fell 10%, Mr. Odean and others predict that firms would make margin calls on some accounts.\par \par \uc2 As of the end of last year, clients of \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 .'s wealth unit, which includes \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2  and private bank U.S. Trust, had some $40 billion in such loans outstanding, up 140% from 2010. \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's customers had $30 billion in these loans, more than double from 2013. \uc2 UBS Group AG\uc2  and \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . also have made billions in such loans, people familiar with those banks said.\par \par \uc2 "The real story for us\u8230\'20\'26has been in the wealth business as we continue to increase our penetration of our client base with lending products," \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's finance chief, \uc2 Jonathan Pruzan\uc2 , said while discussing earnings this month, adding that the bank expects more clients to take out loans in the months ahead. "That's been a real key driver of our wealth business."\par \par \uc2 The growth of securities-backed loans has increasingly drawn the attention of regulators, who have questioned the brokerages' marketing and sales efforts as well as the suitability of the loans.\par \par \uc2 Merrill opened more than 121,000 such loan accounts between 2010 and 2014 with more than $85 billion in total credit extended, according to a \uc2 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\uc2  settlement order last year. In the matter, Finra alleged that Merrill didn't fully explain the risks of securities-backed loans and used risky or concentrated investments as collateral.\par \par \uc2 Merrill settled its case without admitting or denying the allegations. Merrill reported its securities-lending oversight lapses to Finra initially and cooperated with the regulator's inquiry, according to Merrill representatives. The representatives added that the firm has improved its procedures around how the loans are supervised.\par \par \uc2 Massachusetts' securities watchdog last year accused \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  of developing a sales program that encouraged brokers to pitch these loans regardless of whether clients needed them. Brokers involved in the incentive program were given scripts coaching them to offer securities-backed loans to clients who said they needed to pay taxes or cover expenses for a wedding or a graduation party, or if they mentioned "purchasing a luxury item like a car or yacht," according to the regulator.\par \par \uc2 "It's not healthy for the industry," said William Galvin, Massachusetts' top securities regulator, who has been investigating how firms motivate brokers to push these loans. Brokerages "should be more concerned about this," he said, "but they're in favor of competition and seeing who can get more loans."\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  agreed to a $1 million settlement with the regulator in April without admitting or denying wrongdoing. A Morgan Stanley spokesman said Massachusetts found no evidence that any clients were harmed or that any of the loans were unsuitable or unauthorized. "We have taken steps to strengthen and clarify our policies and controls around such initiatives," the spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 SEC Chairman Puts in a Good Word for Active Investing\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Stock pickers may have a friend in their newest regulator.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton said Wednesday that his investments in actively managed mutual funds have performed better than passive investments such as funds that track an index. Mr. Clayton, a former corporate lawyer who took over the SEC in May, said he has been "pretty much an index investor" but benefited from active management.\par \par \uc2 "Index investing has been great for me, but my best returning investments were actively managed funds," he told an audience at the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 . "So from personal experience, I certainly would not want to get rid of those."\par \par \uc2 Beyond providing insight into his own preferences as an investor, Mr. Clayton's views are relevant because the commission may pursue rules to impose stricter responsibility on brokers who advise investors. The Trump administration is weighing how to scale back a similar regulation issued last year by the \uc2 U.S. Labor Department\uc2  that it considers too costly.\par \par \uc2 Business groups hope that if the SEC writes its own rule, it could replace the framework issued by the Labor Department under former President Barack Obama, set to fully take effect in early 2018.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton has sought feedback on how to write a new SEC standard to govern the conflicts of interest that brokers face. Brokers generally enjoy a lower standard for dealing with customers than money managers, who have a legal duty to act in the best interest of their clients. Any new SEC rules shouldn't result in fewer choices for investors, Mr. Clayton said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "If someone wants to have an account where they pick 10 stocks and invest for the long term, evaluate them from time to time \u8230\'20\'26 that is how my grandparents who were both federal employees built their retirement," he said. "I don't want that choice to disappear for the Main Street investor."\par \par \uc2 The Labor Department measure, known as the fiduciary rule, is potentially a boon for lower-cost passive investments such as exchange-traded funds that track an index. The Labor rule makes it harder for brokers advising retirement accounts to sell higher-fee, actively managed mutual funds.\par \par \uc2 Mutual-fund companies have scrambled to launch new products meant to help brokers comply with Labor's rule even as the Trump administration signals that it wants to water down or delay the rule. The department recently sought more feedback from the industry on the costs of the rule for the financial-services industry.\par \par \uc2 Automation Takes Aim at Financial Advisers\u8212\'20\'14and Their Fees\par \par \uc2 By Jason Zweig, Anne Tergesen and Andrea Fuller\par \par \uc2 Automation is threatening one of the most personal businesses in personal finance: advice.\par \par \uc2 Over the past decade, financial advisers in brokerage houses and independent firms have amassed trillions in assets helping individuals shape investment portfolios and hammer out financial plans. They earn around 1% of these assets in annual fees, a cost advisers say is deserved because they understand clients' particular situations and can provide assurance when markets fall.\par \par \uc2 In the latest test of the reach of technology, a new breed of competitors\u8212\'20\'14 including \uc2 Betterment LLC\uc2  and Wealthfront Inc. but also initiatives from established firms such as \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14is contending even the most personal financial advice can be delivered online, over the phone or by videoconferencing, with fees as low as zero. The goal is to provide good-enough quality at a much lower price.\par \par \uc2 "It's always been questionable whether or not advisers were earning our money at 1% and up," said Paul Auslander, director of financial planning at \uc2 ProVise Management Group\uc2  in Clearwater, Fla., who says potential clients now compare him with less expensive alternatives. "The spread's got to narrow."\par \par \uc2 The shift has big implications for financial firms that count on advice as a source of stable profits, as well as for rivals trying to build new businesses at lower prices. It also could mean millions in annual savings for consumers and could expand the overall market for advice.\par \par \uc2 Competitors across the spectrum agree the demand is there. Advice "is big and growing\u8212\'20\'14it's what clients are looking for," said Roger Hobby, executive vice president of private wealth management at Fidelity Investments.\par \par \uc2 The hunger for help marks a shift from the 1990s, when do-it-yourself investing was in vogue. Back then, the adoption of 401(k) plans moved responsibility for investment choices to company employees just as one of the biggest bull markets in history was boosting individuals' confidence in their investing prowess. Meanwhile, pioneering online brokerage firms made trading inexpensive and convenient.\par \par \uc2 After internet stocks collapsed in 2000, along with the broader stock market eight years later, many individuals sought help. In the past decade, baby boomers started to retire and wanted technical guidance on drawing down their assets.\par \par \uc2 The advice industry expanded with the demand. Besides managing people's investment portfolios\u8212\'20\'14handling the trades, not merely suggesting them\u8212\'20\'14some financial advisers also provide help with budgets or tax and estate planning.\par \par \uc2 The number of advisory firms grew to almost 3,900 in 2017, up from fewer than 750 in 2002, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  data. This universe of firms handles at least $100 million in assets each and provides both investment management and financial planning to individuals.\par \par \uc2 As of March 2017, such firms collectively had $5.5 trillion in assets on which they made investment decisions, the Journal's analysis found. That is about six times as much as in 2002.\par \par \uc2 Throughout this period, advice fees have largely held steady\u8212\'20\'14typically 1% of assets, with a potential discount for big accounts. One reason the standard held is many clients value aspects of advice that can't always be measured or easily compared.\par \par \uc2 C. Lansdowne Hunt, 72, of Burke, Va., said he became more price-conscious after his portfolio fell 31% in the late-2008 stock-market meltdown. So in 2012, he switched to a less expensive adviser, and this year, asked for a discount on its 0.9% fee.\par \par \uc2 After being rebuffed, Mr. Hunt shopped for a new adviser for his $1.3 million portfolio at firms including \uc2 Charles Schwab Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 TD Ameritrade Inc\uc2 . and Edward Jones. The former Naval officer and defense-contractor employee concluded his current Virginia advisory firm offers services, such as tax-sensitive investing and stock picking, that might be hard to replicate for a lower cost.\par \par \uc2 "I couldn't get the exact twin," he said.\par \par \uc2 Many firms are wagering that other customers will take less, for less.\par \par \uc2 About two years ago, \uc2 Vanguard Group\uc2 , known for serving do-it-yourselfers, started undercutting the financial-adviser industry with an annual advice fee of 0.3%.\par \par \uc2 Assets in its service, which combines recommendations from computer-driven algorithms with phone, video and email consultations with human advisers, grew to about $35 billion in the first year and to $83 billion by end of last month, according to the firm.\par \par \uc2 Joe McDonald of Titus, Ala., was an early customer. Long a do-it-yourself investor, he decided he needed an adviser after making an ill-timed move into an all-cash portfolio after Barack Obama's 2008 election.\par \par \uc2 "I pulled out and stayed in cash until 2014, which was a terrible mistake," said the 74-year-old retired electrical engineer. "I found I didn't really have the discipline to stick with my own plan."\par \par \uc2 He thought about hiring a traditional adviser in Florida who charges 1% of assets under management. His wife wasn't comfortable entrusting money with someone she didn't know, he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McDonald said he first invested in a mutual fund from \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  in 1983. He liked its 0.3% fee on an account with advice, and moved his roughly $500,000 in retirement accounts there.\par \par \uc2 "Expenses don't mean a whole lot if you are making 10% a year," Mr. McDonald said, "but if you are making 2% or 3% a year, they are a real big deal."\par \par \uc2 At Schwab, assets handled by financial advisers, including those at independent firms that use Schwab's services, now account for more than half of the firm's total assets. In recent years, the discount brokerage firm has added a range of options for those seeking advice, including a "robo" service introduced in 2015 that uses algorithms to build and monitor portfolios.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Fidelity\uc2 , assets handled with financial advice, either from the firm or from independent advisers who use its services, have nearly doubled over five years.\par \par \uc2 Part of the shift is generational, as younger adults appear to trust technology more than what they see as salesmanship. "Kids are saying to their parents, \u8216\'20\'18Why the hell are you paying so much to your adviser? Is it worth 1% a year to have somebody to play golf with?' " said Joe Duran, chief executive of United Capital Financial Advisers LLC, an investment-management and financial-planning firm that also provides services to advisers.\par \par \uc2 Independent robo advisers that target younger customers\u8212\'20\'14with fees as low as zero for the smallest accounts\u8212\'20\'14have enjoyed hefty growth. Betterment and Wealthfront say they manage $9.7 billion and $7.1 billion in assets, respectively, up from $5.1 billion and $3.5 billion a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , \uc2 UBS Group AG\uc2 , \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . and Bank of AmericaCorp.'s \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2 , known for providing full-frills service at top rates, are testing or have already launched automated-advice ventures that charge less than their standard fees. The goal is to keep fee-conscious and lower-balance customers.\par \par \uc2 Some dealmakers are buying up traditional financial advisers with an eye toward consolidating and cutting costs, saying the industry has too many firms with outmoded technology and high overhead. The first half of 2017 was the most active yet for mergers and acquisitions among financial advisers, according to consulting and investment-banking firm DeVoe & Co.\par \par \uc2 The myriad pressures have traditional financial advisers investing in timesaving technology to cut costs. Some are passing along part of the savings to clients through fee reductions, while others are adding services to justify maintaining their fees. According to a survey from research firm Cerulli Associates, 79% of executives at advisory firms expect their fees to fall within the next five years.\par \par \uc2 Ann Gugle, a principal at Alpha Financial Advisors in Charlotte, N.C., said her firm recently cut its annual fee on assets of over $5 million to 0.125% from 0.25%. "If you do the math, you realize your practice will be worth significantly more if you're smart about aligning your pricing with the value you deliver," said Ms. Gugle. "If not, you're going to be mincemeat."\par \par \uc2 Robert Schmansky, a solo practitioner in Livonia, Mich., dropped his advisory fee to 0.85% from 1% earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, Mr. Schmansky said, he has mainly marketed himself as a fiduciary\u8212\'20\'14someone committed to working in the client's best interests. Now he finds himself in direct competition with \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 , Schwab and others that also call themselves fiduciaries. "My key marketing distinction is being eroded by these firms in some ways."\par \par \uc2 He said he works with a lot of younger investors, and "when I tell them my fee is 1%, they know immediately that Betterment costs less."\par \par \uc2 Of all the initiatives, \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 's is widely cited as the most threatening to the status quo. The firm's size, brand recognition and aggressive pricing will create a challenge unlike anything independent advisers have seen before, said \uc2 Michael Kitces\uc2 , director of wealth management at \uc2 Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc\uc2 . in Columbia, Md.\u8212\'20\'14much as \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 's index funds have wreaked havoc on the traditional mutual-fund business.\par \par \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 's Personal Advisor Services (minimum investment: $50,000), has gained traction because customers want it, said \uc2 Karin Risi\uc2 , head of the firm's retail investor group: "They didn't just want to invest in a fund with us\u8212\'20\'14they were saying they needed more help."\par \par \uc2 So far, only about 10% of assets in the program comes from clients new to the firm. Advisers and industry analysts say it is only a matter of time before the service starts poaching more clients from competitors.\par \par \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  has devoted about 500 financial advisers to its venture, said Ms. Risi. She expects the firm to hire roughly 100 advisers annually for the next several years. Clients with more than $500,000 get a dedicated adviser, who is a certified financial planner; those with less interact with rotating advisers drawn from a pool, some not yet CFPs.\par \par \uc2 Many traditional advisers suggest that partially automated services such as \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 's provide basic, cookie-cutter advice inferior to what an experienced financial planner can provide. Ms. Risi said the firm's advisers go through "pretty impressive training."\par \par \uc2 Elyse Foster\uc2 , an adviser in Boulder, Colo., has taken note. Three years ago, she cut financial-planning fees by an average of 40% at her firm, Harbor Financial Group Inc. It also has invested in technology that allows clients to open accounts online, automatically rebalances portfolios to a target mix of stocks and bonds, and shares software so clients can simulate their own planning scenarios.\par \par \uc2 "We are aware consumers are more price-conscious and are lowering our fees proactively," said Ms. Foster. "We are trying to stay ahead of the industry."\par \par \uc2 Analysis: The Myth of Trump's Do-Nothing Presidency\par \par \uc2 By Greg Ip\par \par \uc2 Six months into his presidency, Donald Trump's detractors portray him as a do-nothing president with no big wins on issues such as health care, taxes and infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 That may be true if the benchmark is legislation, but that is an incomplete benchmark. To gauge a president's impact you have to go beyond the laws he signs to the vast authority he wields through departments and agencies that apply the law. On that score, Mr. Trump is on track to do a lot. On finance, the internet, immigration and drugs, to name just a few issues, Trump appointees have begun nudging the economy and the country in a more conservative, pro-business direction. Whether that is good or bad is to a great extent in the eye of the beholder. What isn't debatable is that the imperial presidency, after expanding under Barack Obama, remains just as formidable under Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks headlines have been dominated by the Senate's stop-start efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Away from this drama, Mr. Trump's Labor Department moved to undo Mr. Obama's expansion of eligibility for overtime pay, financial regulators dropped efforts to tighten restrictions on banker pay and the Interior Department signaled it would rescind proposed rules on oil and gas fracking on federal land. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced transgender individuals couldn't serve in the military, reversing an Obama-era decision.\par \par \uc2 In Mr. Trump's first six months, rule-making has changed dramatically. The latest update on regulatory actions released last week by the \uc2 White House Office of Management and Budget\uc2  contained 1,731 preliminary, proposed or final rules, down 40% from its peak under Mr. Obama in 2011 and a 17-year low, according to Sofie Miller of George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center. Many actions taken under Mr. Trump are actually reversals of earlier rules. Ms. Miller says of 66 completed actions at the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2 , a third were rule withdrawals.\par \par \uc2 This may not yet meet Mr. Trump's promise to repeal two rules for every new rule written, and indeed, agencies may find they are often legally compelled to have a rule whether they like it or not.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, the shift is clear. Deciding not to act can be just as consequential as deciding to act, given the discretion presidents have in how they enforce existing laws. Mr. Obama, for example, chose to not deport some classes of illegal immigrants. Mr. Trump's playbook is similar. His appointees have signaled they will use the discretion allowed under the sweeping Dodd-Frank postcrisis regulatory overhaul to loosen the reins on finance. \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , the acting comptroller of the currency, has suggested he may reinterpret the "Volcker rule" prohibition on proprietary trading to make it less onerous.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has been criticized for how few officials have been confirmed to key jobs. Time will take care of that, and in the meantime, understaffed agencies can still get plenty done. The \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2  is moving quickly to undo the Obama-era decision to regulate internet service providers like utilities even though two of the commission's five seats are vacant.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump may be distracted with investigations into his campaign's links to Russia or cable news, but that really doesn't matter to regulators who have enormous freedom to act without any input from the White House. A shift in the political winds can also prompt agency staff, companies and individuals to fall in line. Amicus Therapeutics, a biotech company, recently applied for approval of a drug treating a rare genetic disorder without the additional clinical trial the Food and Drug Administration had previously demanded, a sign the agency's new commissioner, \uc2 Scott Gottlieb\uc2 , is pushing faster approvals.\par \par \uc2 Now that the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  is prioritizing deportation, far fewer illegal immigrants are attempting to enter the U.S., judging by reduced apprehensions at the Southwest border.\par \par \uc2 There are of course real-life limits to executive authority. Mr. Trump was ready to tear up the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  until other countries and companies persuaded him that would be rash.\par \par \uc2 And there are still the courts. Mr. Obama's sweeping limits on power-plant carbon-dioxide emissions and his overtime pay rule were both halted by courts, as was Mr. Trump's initial ban on travel from several majority-Muslim countries. But courts generally defer to regulators under a 1984 Supreme Court precedent called "\uc2 Chevron\uc2  deference."\par \par \uc2 Even liberal justices may be reluctant to challenge presidential prerogative, as the Supreme Court signaled with a unanimous preliminary decision upholding parts of the travel ban. Liberals who applauded Mr. Obama's exercise of presidential prerogative will have little grounds to protest when Mr. Trump does the same.\par \par \uc2 Of course, the fruits of Mr. Trump's presidential actions, like Mr. Obama's, could be swept away as soon as another president takes office. But for the time being, don't underestimate how much a president can shape the economy with no input at all from Congress.\par \par \uc2 U.K.'s Financial Regulator to Extend Accountability Rules\par \par \uc2 By Philip Georgiadis\par \par \uc2 The U.K.'s financial regulator is set to widen the scope of rules designed to hold senior bosses personally accountable for a firm's misconduct.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  said Wednesday it would extend its rules on accountability to all areas, from fund managers and stock exchanges to smaller firms. The rules\u8212\'20\'14which have been in place since 2016\u8212\'20\'14had previously only applied to banks, building societies, credit unions and some investment firms.\par \par \uc2 The focus on holding management personally to account is part of the U.K. regulator's broad response to misconduct since the financial crisis. A new accountability system to consider standards and culture in U.K. banking was first put forward by politicians following a wave of damaging scandals and government bailouts to the sector.\par \par \uc2 "There is a global trend on focusing increasingly on holding individuals to account, led by the U.S. and U.K.," said Barnabas Reynolds, global co-head of financial institutions at law firm \uc2 Shearman & Sterling LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While the U.S. doesn't have a directly comparable regulatory regime, U.S. regulators do have the ability to bring actions against individuals as part of their broad enforcement powers, said Mr. Reynolds.\par \par \uc2 In September 2015, the Justice Department unveiled new rules that encouraged a greater focus on individual wrongdoing as part of investigations. The so-called Yates Memo, named after Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, included guidelines instructing prosecutors to "focus on wrongdoing by individuals from the very beginning of any investigation of corporate misconduct."\par \par \uc2 The FCA said the rules aim to encourage staff at all levels to take responsibility for their actions, and ensure staff and firms can clearly understand and demonstrate where responsibility lies.\par \par \uc2 It said the responsibilities of senior staff should be clearly laid out, and that managers would be responsible for both their own actions and the actions of the staff they lead.\par \par \uc2 "This is about individuals, not just institutions," said Jonathan Davidson, an executive director at the FCA.\par \par \uc2 "The new conduct rules will ensure that individuals in financial services are held to high standards, and that consumers know what is required of the individuals they deal with," Mr. Davidson said.\par \par \uc2 The regulator is proposing five rules apply to all regulated firms.\par \par \uc2 "Individuals must act with integrity, act with due care, skill and diligence, be open and cooperative with regulators, pay due regard to customer interests and treat them fairly, and observe proper standards of market conduct," the FCA said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Around 47,000 firms will be affected by the rule changes, and the regulator has proposed a tailored approach to reflect the different risk complexities and business structures of firms across London, and said the new rules will be "proportionate and flexible."\par \par \uc2 China's Overhaul of State Companies Approaches Modernization Milestone\par \par \uc2 BEIJING\u8212\'20\'14China is close to completing a long-targeted overhaul of operations at its state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, saying Wednesday that a modernization of their corporate structures will be finished this year.\par \par \uc2 All major companies owned by the central government, excluding financial and cultural firms, will be transformed into limited-liability or joint-stock companies by Dec. 31, according to a plan released by the State Council, or cabinet.\par \par \uc2 Already, about 90% of these state-owned companies have completed the restructuring, the cabinet said.\par \par \uc2 As part of the overhaul, companies are setting up boards of directors to make important decisions, such as those related to hiring and compensation, the State Council said.\par \par \uc2 However, the ruling Communist Party, which currently appoints senior managers at the SOEs, is expected to maintain a strong influence over decision-making at the companies. The cabinet said the enterprises must ensure the party's "core leadership" role through their appointments of company officers and establishment of party organizations.\par \par \uc2 The statement came as the government continues efforts to energize China's often-lumbering state companies and make them more competitive, including through combining some into larger entities. Completing this latest wave of restructuring is likely to pave the way for further measures.\par \par \uc2 Ying Wang, a senior director at \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2 , said the overhaul was an initial step toward increasing efficiency and improving internal controls at state companies.\par \par \uc2 A party congress set to be held this fall is expected to further endorse "mixed ownership" structures allowing state companies to sell stakes to attract private capital\u8212\'20\'14a process already under way.\par \par \uc2 The goal to restructure SOEs was first proposed at a major party meeting in 1993 that set China on a path to building a "socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics"\u8212\'20\'14a euphemism for blending capitalism with state planning.\par \par \uc2 State-owned companies, while now much fewer in number, still dominate important sectors of the economy, including banking, energy and telecommunications.\par \par \uc2 An overall economic slowdown in recent years has crimped SOEs' profits, especially in backbone heavy-industrial sectors hurt by excess capacity.\par \par \uc2 However, a property boom and government spending on infrastructure over the past year have generated a turnaround, with state companies reporting double-digit profit growth during the first half of 2017.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Liyan Qi\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  Pushed 400 Companies to Put Women on Boards. Most Shrugged\par \par \uc2 By Justin Baer and Joann S. Lublin\par \par \uc2 Roughly 400 publicly traded American companies with no women on their board ignored a request to make a bigger effort on gender diversity when approached by one of the largest asset managers in the world.\par \par \uc2 Index-fund giant State Street Global Advisors, which oversees more than $2.5 trillion in assets, had pledged in March to throw its weight behind the issue this year. The company found 468 companies it owns shares of in the U.S. lacked a single female board member. Of that group, the Boston-based firm said about 400 companies failed to address gender diversity in any meaningful way.\par \par \uc2 The money manager, a unit of custody bank \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 ., then voted against the re-election of directors charged with nominating new board members at each of these companies. Directors faced reelection at those companies' latest annual meetings.\par \par \uc2 The paucity of women directors has drawn more scrutiny in recent years, emerging as a rallying cry for investors seeking to improve companies' governance practices. Progress has been slow. Nearly a quarter of the companies in the Russell 3000 index lack a female director, according to ISS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a unit of \uc2 Institutional Shareholder Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The fact that you have over 400 companies was surprising to me," said Rakhi Kumar, head of asset stewardship as State Street Global Advisors, referencing the almost 470 companies that lacked a female board member.\par \par \uc2 Boards have been slow to add women for various reasons, including their infrequent turnover and preference for experienced chief executives. But there also has been limited pressure from big institutional investors.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  hopes to change that picture.\par \par \uc2 Primarily a manager of exchange-traded funds and other passive investments, the firm reviewed companies within the Russell 3000 Index in the U.S., the U.K.'s FTSE 350 and S&P/ASX 300 in Australia. \uc2 State Street\uc2 , which owns a combined 3,500 stocks in those three indexes, said it contacted a total of 476 companies in those countries.\par \par \uc2 Health-care companies were the worst performing group, accounting for about a quarter of those with no women on their boards.\par \par \uc2 2020 Women on Boards, an organization that's working to bring better boardroom gender diversity, praised \uc2 State Street\uc2 's action this proxy season.\par \par \uc2 The votes set an example for "companies that may talk about diversity but don't take action,'' the group's president, Malli Gero, wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 In a report last week, 2020 Women found that nearly half of the 75 biggest initial public offerings of the last three years featured companies that lacked board women when they first sold shares to the public.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  is among the largest passive fund managers in the world\u8212\'20\'14a sector that is amassing significant governance power as investors pour billions into lower-cost index-tracking funds like ETFs. Since those investments are through passive vehicles, it doesn't have the ability to simply sell shares in a company. Instead, the firm has to use its voting power to bring about change.\par \par \uc2 "There are terrific longitudinal studies that show gender diversity leads to better performance," said \uc2 Ronald O'Hanley\uc2 , chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. "If there is clear evidence companies aren't making progress, or not attempting to make progress, we will use our power of vote."\par \par \uc2 Fellow passive investment giant \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . backed eight shareholder proposals this spring promoting gender diversity. In five of those instances, the money manager voted against the nominating committee chairman's re-election.\par \par \uc2 "We are an engagement-first company," a BlackRock spokesman said. "We meet with 1,500 companies a year to talk about a variety of issues. We do that because we believe a vote against a director or management is the end of the engagement process."\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  said some of the boards that failed to address their lack of women directors had reasonable explanations. For instance, several shared that they had been close to naming someone when the candidate changed jobs and could no longer serve. In another case, the company's board lost a female director when it went through a merger.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  isn't alone in its efforts to add gender diversity to corporate America. The 30% Club, which started in the U.K. and has since expanded globally, encourages companies to promote more women throughout their ranks and chairmen to put more women on boards. Notably, very few of the companies with no female board members came from the U.K.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Seeking to \u8216\'20\'18Normalize' Chinese IPOs\par \par \uc2 China's stock regulator pledged to maintain a "normalization" in IPOs, according to a meeting earlier this week on securities and futures regulation. The regulator posted a summary of the meeting, which it said followed the spirit set by the recent National Financial Work Conference, on its website Wednesday. The statement didn't explain what "normalization" meant, although it suggests a reluctance to halt the IPO market altogether. The regulator, which controls the pace of companies going public, has in the past sat on applications in order to stabilize a falling market. When shares came under pressure in May, the CSRC slowed its IPO approval pace for more than a month.

The capital-raising was for six deals, led by the IPOs of Brazilian airline Azul and Cuervo, the largest tequila maker in Mexico. Cuervo was the largest offering by a Mexican company over the last six years.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Turbulence in the retail sector is hitting executives working for the top mall companies where it hurts: in their wallets.\par \par \uc2 Senior management teams at the country's largest mall owners, including \uc2 Simon Property Group Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 GGP Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Macerich\uc2 , are taking cuts to their compensation as they navigate an industry beset with struggling retailers and increasing competition from online shopping.\par \par \uc2 The slide in compensation among retail landlords is unusual in the corporate world. Executives at companies in other sectors are less likely to feel the pain of a rough patch because their pay isn't as closely tied to stock performance.\par \par \uc2 But the real-estate investment trust industry is ahead of most other sectors in designing pay plans to align the interests of shareholders and management, according to \uc2 Jeremy Banoff\uc2 , a senior managing director with FPL Associates LP, a compensation-consulting firm that focuses on the real-estate industry.\par \par \uc2 As a result, when stocks fall, it is more likely that compensation cuts result, he said. "The rest of the world is playing catch-up," Mr. Banoff said.\par \par \uc2 Indianapolis-based Simon, the country's largest mall owner with stakes in more than 325 properties, took the rare step of eliminating stock grants tied to the company's long-term performance for top executives, according to its proxy statement filed with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Simon did this because of "the challenging business conditions in the retail industry that the company is facing," according to the proxy statement. A spokeswoman for Simon declined to comment beyond what was written in the filing.\par \par \uc2 Executives at other big mall owners suffered because their compensation is tied to the performance of their share prices, which have been hammered during the past 18 months as investors have fled the sector.\par \par \uc2 For example, Macerich Chief Executive \uc2 Arthur Coppola\uc2  had a target compensation package -- including base salary, annual incentive and other benefits -- potentially worth $12 million in 2016. But because the company's stock price dropped, Mr. Coppola was on track to receive only $5.7 million of that, according to the company's proxy filing.\par \par \uc2 "That's the way the stock plans are structured," said Macerich Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Thomas O'Hern\uc2  in an interview. "When the stock is down, we suffer from a compensation standpoint."\par \par \uc2 The retail sector was facing problems even before the e-commerce revolution. Rampant development left the U.S. with far more malls than it needed by the time the last recession hit.\par \par \uc2 A decade later the country is still considered "overstored" and Americans are doing more than 8% of all shopping online, creating enormous headaches for mall owners on the demand side. Space has emptied as big retailers like \uc2 Macy's Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 J.C. Penney Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Bebe Stores Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Sears Holdings Corp\uc2 . have closed stores across the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Until now most of the pain has been suffered by the lower-quality malls, which have taken the greatest hits to occupancy and rents. More of these properties are being sold at steep discounts or going into default.\par \par \uc2 But the cuts in compensation show that the pain is now spreading to the owners of the highest-quality malls. These popular malls, usually in higher-income areas, have done a good job thus far of keeping rents and occupancies from falling and replacing closing stores with new tenants, according to analysts.\par \par \uc2 For example, Simon earlier this year reported its occupancy was 95.6% at the end of the first quarter, unchanged from a year earlier. Base minimum rent was $51.87 a square foot, an increase of 4.4%, Simon said.\par \par \uc2 But the shares of the top mall companies haven't been immune to investor concerns that the internet's impact on bricks-and-mortar shopping could get much worse. "The severe negative sentiment surrounding retail real estate has sent many retail REIT share prices into a free fall," said a recent report on the sector by \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Last year, retail REITs rose only 0.95% while the broader equity REIT market gained 8.63% and the S&P 500 increased 11.96%. This year retail REITs were down 10.4% through Monday, compared with up 5.6% for the REIT market and 11.6% for the S&P 500.\par \par \uc2 The downdraft is hitting companies with top regional malls as well as those that own shabbier properties. For example, Simon owns such trophies as the Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas; Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, Fla.; and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, N.Y. Its shares were down about 9% this year through Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Part of the pressure on retail REITs is coming from short sellers, who bet share prices will fall. So-called short interest on Simon jumped to $2.3 billion in June from $870.9 million in November. Over the same period, short-interest trades in GGP increased to $1.4 billion from $424 million, according to data from S3 Partners, a financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm.\par \par \uc2 Many companies in the corporate world also use stock-price performance but to a lesser degree than REITs, Mr. Banoff said. This is partly because the real-estate industry has long had a focus on rewarding managers for increasing the value of their properties, he said.\par \par \uc2 At GGP, Chief Executive \uc2 Sandeep Mathrani\uc2  took a cut of more than $1 million based on criteria that include the company's stock performance, according to \uc2 Kevin Berry\uc2 , GGP's head of investor relations. The company revamped its compensation program following a negative vote by shareholders last year on a nonbinding "say on pay" resolution.\par \par \uc2 The impact on Simon executives' pocketbooks was greater because of the company's elimination of its stock-grant program last year. \uc2 David Simon\uc2 , the company's chief executive, was awarded stock valued at about $9.5 million from that program in each of the previous three years, according to Mr. Banoff of \uc2 FPL\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other members of Simon's executive team were awarded stock valued at $2.5 million or $3 million from the program in previous years. In 2017, no grants will be awarded, according to the company's proxy\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Esther Fung contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170726000031"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170726ed7r0000o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Intuition can be a wonderful thing when we need to make decisions quickly and efficiently. However, what appears common sense at first glance can turn out to be totally wrong on closer inspection. One aspect of the active/passive debate risks falling into this trap. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/market-studies/ms15-2-3.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 final report }}}\uc2  by the \uc2 UK\u8217\'20\'19s Financial Conduct Authority\uc2 , the regulator, on the asset management industry rightly champions value for money but states that it was wrong to interpret their findings as suggesting passive funds are better than active.\par \par \uc2 The thorny issue of transaction costs has drawn the ire of many. Every time a fund manager buys or sells a share they incur transaction costs. More frequent trading, or higher turnover, increases those transaction costs. In a world fixated on costs, it is easy to make the leap and assume that funds with higher turnover generate worse outcomes for investors. Conventional wisdom is overpowering on this front, but it is also wrong.\par \par \uc2 Of course it is true that high turnover might indicate low conviction or short-termism, and trading too often does eat into the returns an active fund delivers for investors. However, it is unfair to suggest that all turnover is bad. If a fund manager sells a stock that subsequently underperforms and replaces it with another that outperforms then the impact on performance should be positive, even after allowing for transaction costs. Conversely, if they hold on to stocks that have been underperforming then this could be a sign of a portfolio based on stale views.\par \par \uc2 We have spent some time analysing the link between portfolio turnover and excess returns among US-domiciled active equity funds and our {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.schroders.com/en/sysglobalassets/global-assets/english/pdf/churn-is-not-necessarily-burn-18-july-2017.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 research dispels this myth }}}\uc2 . We found no evidence of a structural relationship between turnover and excess returns among active US equity funds over the 1991-2016 period.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes low turnover funds outperform and sometimes high turnover funds, without exhibiting any real pattern. Statistical analysis confirms the lack of relationship. This conclusion holds over both one- and three-year investment horizons.\par \par \uc2 Past performance is not a guide to future performance and may not be repeated.\par \par \uc2 What may be more surprising is that we found no evidence of any relationship across all other styles of US equity fund, even in small-caps where the costs of trading are noticeably higher. On average, high turnover US equity funds have been able to add at least enough value to offset the additional transaction costs they incur. The moral is that pursuing a reduction in transaction costs without considering the consequences is misguided. Consistency between investment process and turnover is more important than the level of turnover itself.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, it is just as wrong to focus this aspect of the debate on active funds. Smart beta indices, the current darling of the investment universe, experience much higher levels of turnover than traditional equity indices.\par \par \uc2 In the 12 months to June 30 2017, compared with a 2.6 per cent turnover rate for the MSCI USA index, the US minimum volatility and quality indices run by the same provider had turnover levels of slightly more than 20 per cent while the MSCI momentum index had turnover of more than 100 per cent. If cost really is all that matters to some investors, they would do well to read the small print.\par \par \uc2 But active managers are not out of the woods yet. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/emerging-markets"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Emerging market }}}\uc2  equity funds with consistently higher turnover have, on average, tended to underperform their lower-turnover rivals. The best-performing emerging market equity funds also typically have lower turnover.\par \par \uc2 And if you\u8217\'20\'19re going to invest in a fund with a process that results in higher turnover, you had better make sure you choose wisely. The best high-turnover US equity funds outperform the best low-turnover funds, but the worst do worse and high-turnover funds have a statistically significant lower survival rate. Get it right and the gains may be higher, but get it wrong and the downside is also greater.\par \par \uc2 This issue really gets to the heart of where much of the debate has gone on asset management. It has become wholly focused on costs, where cheaper is assumed to be better. But there are good high-cost funds and there are bad high-cost funds. That\u8217\'20\'19s not to downplay the challenge of selecting an active fund manager who will outperform but a single-minded focus on cost is unlikely to be the best response. In the \uc2 FCA\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s words, what investors should focus on is value for money.\par \par \uc2 Duncan Lamont is head of research and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , the UK\u8217\'20\'19s largest listed asset manager.

Most Shrugged; The index-fund giant voted against the reelection of directors charged with nominating new board members at each of these companies\b0\par\par\uc2 By Justin Baer and Joann S. Lublin \par \uc2 853 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2017\par 00:22\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Roughly 400 publicly traded American companies with no women on their board ignored a request to make a bigger effort on gender diversity when approached by one of the largest asset managers in the world.\par \par \uc2 Index-fund giant State Street Global Advisors, which oversees more than $2.5 trillion in assets, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-street-says-it-will-start-voting-against-companies-that-dont-have-women-directors-1488862863"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 had pledged in March}}}\uc2  to throw its weight behind the issue this year. The company found 468 companies it owns shares of in the U.S. lacked a single female board member. Of that group, the Boston-based firm said about 400 companies failed to address gender diversity in any meaningful way.\par \par \uc2 The money manager, a unit of custody bank \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 ., then {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-street-votes-against-400-companies-citing-gender-diversity-1501029490"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 voted against the re-election of directors}}}\uc2  charged with nominating new board members at each of these companies. Directors faced reelection at those companies' latest annual meetings.\par \par \uc2 The paucity of women directors has drawn more scrutiny in recent years, emerging as a rallying cry for investors seeking to improve companies' governance practices. Progress has been slow. Nearly a quarter of the companies in the Russell 3000 index lack a female director, according to ISS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a unit of \uc2 Institutional Shareholder Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The fact that you have over 400 companies was surprising to me," said Rakhi Kumar, head of asset stewardship as State Street Global Advisors, referencing the almost 470 companies that lacked a female board member.\par \par \uc2 Boards have been slow to add women for various reasons, including their infrequent turnover and preference for experienced chief executives. But there also has been limited pressure from big institutional investors.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  hopes to change that picture.\par \par \uc2 Primarily a manager of exchange-traded funds and other passive investments, the firm reviewed companies within the Russell 3000 Index in the U.S., the U.K.'s FTSE 350 and S&P/ASX 300 in Australia. \uc2 State Street\uc2 , which owns a combined 3,500 stocks in those three indexes, said it contacted a total of 476 companies in those countries.\par \par \uc2 Health-care companies were the worst performing group, accounting for about a quarter of those with no women on their boards.\par \par \uc2 2020 Women on Boards, an organization that's working to bring better boardroom gender diversity, praised \uc2 State Street\uc2 's action this proxy season.\par \par \uc2 The votes set an example for "companies that may talk about diversity but don't take action,'' the group's president, Malli Gero, wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 In a report last week, 2020 Women found that nearly half of the 75 biggest initial public offerings of the last three years featured companies that lacked board women when they first sold shares to the public.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  is among the largest passive fund managers in the world\u8212\'20\'14a sector that is amassing significant governance power as investors pour billions into lower-cost index-tracking funds like ETFs. Since those investments are through passive vehicles, it doesn't have the ability to simply sell shares in a company. Instead, the firm has to use its voting power to bring about change.\par \par \uc2 "There are terrific longitudinal studies that show gender diversity leads to better performance," said \uc2 Ronald O'Hanley\uc2 , chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. "If there is clear evidence companies aren't making progress, or not attempting to make progress, we will use our power of vote."\par \par \uc2 Fellow passive investment giant \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . backed eight shareholder proposals this spring promoting gender diversity. In five of those instances, the money manager voted against the nominating committee chairman's re-election.\par \par \uc2 "We are an engagement-first company," a BlackRock spokesman said. "We meet with 1,500 companies a year to talk about a variety of issues. We do that because we believe a vote against a director or management is the end of the engagement process."\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  said some of the boards that failed to address their lack of women directors had reasonable explanations. For instance, several shared that they had been close to naming someone when the candidate changed jobs and could no longer serve. In another case, the company's board lost a female director when it went through a merger.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  isn't alone in its efforts to add gender diversity to corporate America. The 30% Club, which started in the U.K. and has since expanded globally, encourages companies to promote more women throughout their ranks and chairmen to put more women on boards. Notably, very few of the companies with no female board members came from the U.K.\par \par \uc2 Write to Justin Baer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:justin.baer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 justin.baer@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Joann S.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When it comes to learning more about Chinese stocks, for some investors there is no such thing as too much information.\par \par \uc2 Fund managers have been looking for new ways to conduct due diligence on Chinese companies in which they invest, from deploying the latest \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  software to getting friendly with the ex-wives of directors.\par \par \uc2 Foreign investors are eager to know more about companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen after index provider \uc2 MSCI Inc\uc2 . said in June it would {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/msci-to-include-china-a-shares-in-indexes-1497992319"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 add China's domestic equities to its global market measures}}}\uc2  next year. The companies they are investigating include some from mainland China that are already listed in Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 Even if investors find something they suspect is wrong with a company, it can be hard for them to act, due to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-clamps-down-on-short-selling-1438664957"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 restrictions on short selling}}}\uc2  in China's equity markets. In Hong Kong, meanwhile, the city's market regulators have been pushing back against critical research reports on companies.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, investors are still turning to the several firms that have sprung up in recent years, specializing in research into Chinese companies via a combination of new technology and on-the-ground investigations.\par \par \uc2 "If the company's doing one thing strange in its financials, generally it's doing a number of strange things," said Gillem Tulloch, the founder of Hong Kong-based GMT Research, which sells its reports to mutual funds and hedge funds but doesn't take short positions.\par \par \uc2 The firm recently used satellite imagery from Google Earth to view a large sample of projects owned by Hong Kong-listed China Evergrande Group, the country's largest listed property developer by sales. GMT alleges that the images show that progress of construction work had stalled at several of Evergrande's developments. It included its findings in a report that claimed the company could in practice be insolvent: GMT said its analysts also visited around 40 of Evergrande's properties to verify its findings.\par \par \uc2 Evergrande didn't respond to requests for comment. The company's shares have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-chinese-property-stock-surge-that-is-set-to-crumble-1493025964"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 almost tripled this year}}}\uc2  after it carried out a series of share buybacks.\par \par \uc2 Some companies in China are getting wise to on-the-ground visits. Sean Chen, Hong Kong-based director of strategy at Blackpeak Group, a research and risk-advisory firm, said that while investigating one company listed on the mainland on behalf of an investor, his team found one of its electrical component factories in Guangdong empty.\par \par \uc2 "When we asked the security guards of the neighboring factory, they told us that a few days prior to our own visit, the company had offered to pay 100 yuan ($14.80) to local villagers to come to the factory, wear hard hats and pretend to be workers to impress some [other] foreigner investors who were visiting," Mr. Chen said.\par \par \uc2 Some research firms deploy the latest \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools to comb through company financial data for warning signs. Typically, this involves writing computer code that hunts for traits common to fraudulent firms and then looks for other companies that match.\par \par \uc2 One company using such methods, Shenzhen-based blueflag.io says it is seeing interest from global long-only fund managers who occasionally want to check on individual companies where they suspect fraud.\par \par \uc2 "What they want to own are the new-economy stocks\u8212\'20\'14that's where you have the higher fraud risk," said Fredrik \u214\'00\'D6qvist, the company's founder.\par \par \uc2 Some research methods veer into the personal, as investors try to untangle the sometimes complex web of a company's so-called "related party transactions"\u8212\'20\'14deals between spouses, family members and other close associates that may not always represent the best interests of minority shareholders.\par \par \uc2 One portfolio manager, who asked not to be identified, said she had in the past tried to learn details about the ex-wives of directors or where their children go to school, as a way to unearth information on the company.\par \par \uc2 Making negative research on companies public in Hong Kong can be tricky. The city's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-tribunal-rules-against-u-s-short-seller-andrew-left-1472185068"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 market-misconduct panel last year banned}}}\uc2  short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research from trading securities in the city for five years for publishing a research report about Evergrande in June 2012. The case is currently pending appeal.\par \par \uc2 If a company issues a report questioning the accounting practices of a listed company, their management can ask \uc2 Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission\uc2  to begin an inquiry, which may escalate into an investigation. Disclosing that a company is under investigation is a criminal offense in Hong Kong, carrying penalties of up to two years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of 1 million Hong Kong dollars (US$128,086).\par \par \uc2 The aggressive stance from Hong Kong's regulator has produced a "chilling effect," and has minimized the amount of critical research produced, said Timothy Loh, a Hong Kong lawyer who defended Mr. Left in his case with the SFC last year.\par \par \uc2 "People want to be much more careful about what they say," he said. "They're more scared of what might happen with the SFC subsequently."\par \par \uc2 An SFC spokesman defended the commission's actions. "Responsible research, including research issued by credit-rating agencies and research houses, can all contribute to the overall market quality and price-discovery process and has no intention to suppress legitimate commentaries on listed companies, whether positive or negative," he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:gregor.hunter@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 gregor.hunter@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related Coverage\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/msci-to-include-china-a-shares-in-indexes-1497992319"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 MSCI to Add China Shares to Indexes, Opening Market to More Foreign Investors}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-tribunal-rules-against-u-s-short-seller-andrew-left-1472185068"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Hong Kong Tribunal Rules Against U.S. Short-Seller Andrew Left}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fall-in-evergrande-bond-price-adding-to-market-strains-1498481640"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Strains Emerge as China's Dollar Debt Piles Up}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170726ed7q00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Now \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other data-rich capabilities are making it easier to predict who will develop these conditions\u8212\'20\'14and intervene sooner.\par \par \uc2 "In the past, we looked at a big haystack for a needle," says Richard Popiel, chief medical officer of Cambia Health Solutions. Thanks to new analytical models "we've reduced dramatically the size of the haystack."\par \par \uc2 Cambia, a family of companies that includes six regional health plans, has just launched a pilot program with \uc2 GNS Healthcare\uc2 . \uc2 UnitedHealth Group\uc2  is expanding its work with Ayasdi, and \uc2 Cigna Corp\uc2 . is tapping technology from Prognos.\par \par \uc2 Startups such as Ayasdi Inc., \uc2 GNS Healthcare Inc\uc2 . and Prognos are providing insurers with data-analysis capabilities to help them forecast emerging illnesses and deploy resources. This can help them to better manage chronic diseases and improve the overall health of their members.\par \par \uc2 Health plans historically used claims data to spot and provide resources to people with chronic illnesses. But these efforts were backward-looking and weren't very predictive, according to Dr. Popiel. Through technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , data analysts predict which members will need help and the interventions most likely to work.\par \par \uc2 Cambia is working with Cambridge, Mass.-based \uc2 GNS Healthcare\uc2 , whose causal \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology can help match patients with medical interventions. With help from GNS, Cambia has launched a program to identify members of its Medicare population who have serious illnesses and are potentially facing end-of-life decisions.\par \par \uc2 People who are candidates for palliative care have complex needs. Cambia's goal is to find people it can help and provide them with information that helps them make decisions about their care, Dr. Popiel says.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, insurers such as Cigna are working with New York startup Prognos, which applies AI to clinical diagnostics, to identify members with a high likelihood of being diagnosed with diseases such as diabetes.\par \par \uc2 CareSkore, a Mountain View, Calif., company that serves health-care providers as well as insurers, uses various sources of information, including clinical, claims and demographic data, to generate risk stratifications for patients.\par \par \uc2 Improved data-crunching can also help insurers in other ways. \uc2 UnitedHealth\uc2  since 2014 has used AI capabilities from Ayasdi to root out fraud. The insurer seeks to prevent fraudulent claims from being paid instead of trying to recoup funds after the fact, says Patrick Stamm, chief operating officer, shared services, for UnitedHealthcare.\par \par \uc2 "We think [\b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 ] in general is going to continue to make it easier for us to find fraud, waste and abuse," Mr. Stamm said.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in July \uc2 UnitedHealth\uc2  purchased a license to Ayasdi's clinical variation management application aimed at making care delivery more efficient.\par \par \uc2 Not all startups depend on \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . A wristband from Spry Health Inc. collects cardiovascular and respiratory information from patients with chronic illnesses to spot worrisome trends, such as an elevated breathing rate in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\par \par \uc2 The company doesn't need to apply \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to the data because the information it captures is fundamentally predictive, according to Spry, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif.\par \par \uc2 Insurers are also turning to startups for help understanding the risk of outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as Zika or Ebola. This helps them underwrite risk for countries and corporations seeking insurance policies that help them respond quickly to emerging disease threats.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco-based \uc2 Metabiota Inc\uc2 ., for example, is launching a platform for estimating epidemic preparedness and risk. Reinsurer \uc2 Munich Re\uc2  and \uc2 In-Q-Tel\uc2 , the strategic investor for the U.S. intelligence and defense communities, are using the platform to identify, quantify and mitigate infectious-disease risk.\par \par \uc2 Write to Brian Gormley at brian.gormley@wsj.com.

Executives at companies in other sectors are less likely to feel the pain of a rough patch because their pay isn't as closely tied to stock performance.\par \par \uc2 But the real-estate investment trust industry is ahead of most other sectors in designing pay plans to align the interests of shareholders and management, according to Jeremy Banoff, a senior managing director with FPL Associates LP, a compensation-consulting firm that focuses on the real-estate industry.\par \par \uc2 As a result, when stocks fall, it is more likely that compensation cuts result, he said. "The rest of the world is playing catch-up," Mr. Banoff said.\par \par \uc2 Indianapolis-based Simon, the country's largest mall owner with stakes in more than 325 properties, took the rare step of eliminating stock grants tied to the company's long-term performance for top executives, according to its proxy statement filed with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Simon did this because of "the challenging business conditions in the retail industry that the company is facing," according to the proxy statement. A spokeswoman for Simon declined to comment beyond what was written in the filing.\par \par \uc2 Executives at other big mall owners suffered because their compensation is tied to the performance of their share prices, which have been hammered during the past 18 months as investors have fled the sector.\par \par \uc2 For example, Macerich Chief Executive \uc2 Arthur Coppola\uc2  had a target compensation package\u8212\'20\'14including base salary, annual incentive and other benefits\u8212\'20\'14potentially worth $12 million in 2016. But because the company's stock price dropped, Mr. Coppola was on track to receive only $5.7 million of that, according to the company's proxy filing.\par \par \uc2 "That's the way the stock plans are structured," said Macerich Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Thomas O'Hern\uc2  in an interview. "When the stock is down, we suffer from a compensation standpoint."\par \par \uc2 The retail sector was facing problems even before the e-commerce revolution. Rampant development left the U.S. with far more malls than it needed by the time the last recession hit.\par \par \uc2 A decade later the country is still considered "overstored" and Americans are doing more than 8% of all shopping online, creating enormous headaches for mall owners on the demand side. Space has emptied as big retailers like \uc2 Macy's Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 J.C. Penney Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Bebe Stores Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Sears Holdings Corp\uc2 . have closed stores across the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Up until now most of the pain has been suffered by the lower-quality malls, which have taken the greatest hits to occupancy and rents. More of these properties are being sold at steep discounts or going into default.\par \par \uc2 But the cuts in compensation show that the pain is now spreading to the owners of the highest quality malls. These popular malls, usually in higher-income areas, have done a good job thus far of keeping rents and occupancies from falling and replacing closing stores with new tenants, according to analysts.\par \par \uc2 For example, Simon earlier this year reported its occupancy was 95.6% at the end of the first quarter, unchanged from a year earlier. Base minimum rent was $51.87 a square foot, an increase of 4.4%, Simon said.\par \par \uc2 "Not everyone will be replenishing their wardrobe from their cell phone\u8230\'20\'26while binge watching Netflix , " said a recent report on the retail REIT sector by \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the shares of the top mall companies haven't been immune to investor concerns that the internet's impact on bricks-and-mortar shopping could get much worse. "The severe negative sentiment surrounding retail real estate has sent many retail REIT share prices into a free fall," the Green Street report said.\par \par \uc2 Last year, retail REITs rose only 0.95% while the broader equity REIT market gained 8.63% and the S&P 500 increased 11.96%. This year retail REITs are down 10.4%, compared with up 5.6% for the REIT market and 11.6% for the S&P 500.\par \par \uc2 The downdraft is hitting companies with top regional malls as well as those that own shabbier properties. For example, Simon owns such trophies as the Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas; Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, Fla.; and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, N.Y. Its shares are down 9% this year.\par \par \uc2 Part of the pressure on retail REITs is coming from short sellers, who bet share prices will fall. So-called short interest on Simon jumped to $2.3 billion in June from $870.9 million in November. Over the same period, short interest trades in GGP increased to $1.4 billion from $424 million, according to data from S3 Partners, a financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm.\par \par \uc2 Many companies in the corporate world also use stock price performance but to a lesser degree than REITs, Mr. Banoff said. This is partly because the real-estate industry has long had a focus on rewarding managers for increasing the value of their properties, he said.\par \par \uc2 At GGP, Chief Executive \uc2 Sandeep Mathrani\uc2  took a cut of more than $1 million based on a number of metrics including the company's stock performance, according to \uc2 Kevin Berry\uc2 , GGP's head of investor relations. The company revamped its compensation program following a negative vote by shareholders last year on a nonbinding "say on pay" resolution.\par \par \uc2 The impact on Simon executives' pocketbooks was greater because of the company's elimination of its stock grant program last year. \uc2 David Simon\uc2 , the company's chief executive, was awarded stock valued at about $9.5 million from that program each of the previous three years, according to Mr. Banoff of FPL.\par \par \uc2 Other members of Simon's executive team were awarded stock valued at $2.5 million or $3 million from the program in previous years. In 2017, no grants will be awarded, according to the company's proxy\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Esther Fung contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Peter Grant at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:peter.grant@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 peter.grant@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROBK20170726ed7q0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

In the first half, $209.4 billion of office buildings, stores, warehouses and other commercial real estate changed hands, down 9% from the same period in 2016, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 Declines were especially sharp in major markets. Deal activity fell 55% in Manhattan and 11% in Los Angeles, according to Real Capital. Volume, meanwhile, increased 19% in Dallas and 18% in Atlanta.\par \par \uc2 -- Peter Grant\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 HOUSING\par \par \uc2 Lack of Workers\par \par \uc2 Results in Shortage\par \par \uc2 One of the reasons for the housing shortage that is gripping the U.S. is especially perplexing is a dearth of construction workers.\par \par \uc2 The size of the construction workforce in the U.S. declined to 10.4 million in 2015 from 10.6 million near the bottom of the market in 2010, according to a new analysis of U.S. Census data by Issi Romem, chief economist at BuildZoom, a website for contractors.\par \par \uc2 Contrast that with the period from 2000 to 2005, when the construction labor force -- the sum of employed and unemployed workers -- swelled to 11.5 million from 9.3 million.\par \par \uc2 A critical reason for the recent declines is the graying of the American construction workforce.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, the average construction worker was 7.5 months younger than the typical U.S. worker. By 2005, the gap widened to nearly 18 months. But now the average construction worker is older than the average employee by 5.5 months.\par \par \uc2 "The industry has lost a lot of its younger workers and hasn't been able to bring them back," Mr. Romem said.\par \par \uc2 The result is that fewer new housing units are being built, and those that are tend to be more expensive, in part because of rising wages.\par \par \uc2 -- Laura Kusisto\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 SABRA HEALTH CARE\par \par \uc2 Funds Oppose Deal\par \par \uc2 Two major investors of \uc2 Sabra Health Care REIT Inc\uc2 . are coming out against its proposed deal to acquire another health-care REIT, saying Sabra is overpaying for skilled nursing assets that are in bad shape.\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds Eminence Capital LLC and Hudson Bay Capital Management LP said they plan to vote against Sabra's proposal to buy another real-estate investment trust, \uc2 Care Capital Properties Inc\uc2 ., noting that Care Capital's portfolio of 305 skilled nursing facilities is struggling and will likely continue to worsen.\par \par \uc2 "I clearly disagree with their assessment," said \uc2 Richard Matros\uc2 , chief executive and chairman of the board at Irvine, Calif.-based Sabra.\par \par \uc2 Eminence Capital currently has a 3.9% stake in Sabra, while Hudson Bay Capital has roughly a 3.4% stake. Eminence started investing in Sabra in May while Hudson Bay Capital invested in June.\par \par \uc2 "We think Sabra is making a big mistake in getting bigger in skilled nursing facilities," said Ricky Sandler, founder of Eminence Capital. "Our view is that it's a bad transaction."\par \par \uc2 -- Esther Fung\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170726000022"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170726ed7q0000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Big businesses have embraced flexible work practices, but fewer of them seem to favor full-time working from home.\par \par \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Aetna Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Best Buy Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Honeywell International Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Reddit Inc\uc2 . are among employers that have ended or reduced remote-work arrangements recently as managers demand more collaboration, closer contact with customers\u8212\'20\'14and more control over the workday.\par \par \uc2 Bringing workers back to the office isn't easy, managers say. Remote employees often set their own hours and ways of working, and bridle when faced with open-plan offices and set meeting schedules.\par \par \uc2 A large majority of U.S. employers let staffers telecommute sometimes, according to the \uc2 Society for Human Resource Management\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet the portion of U.S. workers who performed all or some of their work at home fell to 22% last year, from 24% in 2015. Such workers spent an average of 3.1 hours a day toiling at home last year, down slightly from 2015, according to the Labor Department's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://graphics.wsj.com/time-use/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 American Time Use Survey }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Coming back to the office can be "honestly terrifying" for remote workers, says Andrew Marder, a research analyst with \uc2 Capterra Inc\uc2 ., a business-software review site owned by \uc2 Gartner Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Marder telecommuted for about three years while blogging about investing for the \uc2 Motley Fool\uc2  financial website. He was also a full-time caregiver for his newborn during part of that time, and juggled writing and parenting duties by working many evenings.\par \par \uc2 Moving to an office role at Capterra in 2014, Mr. Marder had to get used to the lack of privacy at work and an hour-plus commute to Arlington, Va. As a telecommuter, he was used to working at any hour to meet deadlines. Once in the office, he struggled with prioritizing tasks and managing his time during work hours, frequently missing deadlines in the first months on the job.\par \par \uc2 His manager, J.P. Medved, set weekly meetings to plan Mr. Marder's workflow, arranging his calendar and plotting everything from research phone calls to team meetings and deadlines. Mr. Medved says those changes improved Mr. Marder's ability to submit work on time.\par \par \uc2 Bosses acknowledge that remote workers don't suffer from productivity problems. Research has found telecommuters who can work outside normal office hours and don't have to spend time commuting often are more productive than their cubicle-bound counterparts. Rather, managers want their teams within view and are willing to trade some efficiency for the serendipity that office-based conversations might yield.\par \par \uc2 Companies tend to clamp down on telework during periods of turmoil and reinvention, says Ken Matos, vice president of research at Life Meets Work, a workplace consultancy.\par \par \uc2 "Leaders often say 'I like my co-located team better than my [remote] team, but the work gets done just as well,'" he adds.\par \par \uc2 As a finance vice president at \uc2 Tetra Pak International SA\uc2 , George Benaroya observed waves of colleagues return to company workspaces when new leaders would take over divisions and rein in remote work.\par \par \uc2 Office comebacks were often a letdown, recalls Mr. Benaroya, who left the company in 2012. Workers accustomed to personal space and sole use of their equipment at home had to adjust to cramped spaces, full parking lots and jammed printer queues.\par \par \uc2 The formerly remote employees' egos were bruised, too: The top managers who made special time for them during office visits paid less attention once those workers were a regular presence, he says. Managers spent extra time hand-holding ex-home workers, leaving less time for other duties.\par \par \uc2 "You lose efficiency," Mr. Benaroya says.\par \par \uc2 Tetra Pak spokeswoman Carol Yang says the issues that Mr. Benaroya describe don't reflect the company's current situation.\par \par \uc2 This spring \uc2 IBM\uc2 , long a promoter of remote work, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-a-pioneer-of-remote-work-calls-workers-back-to-the-office-1495108802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 offered thousands of work-from-home employees a choice }}}\uc2  to follow their position back to an office location or apply for a new role. Those who chose to do neither could leave the company.\par \par \uc2 Marketing manager Dave Wilson spent a decade working from home in Nashua, N.H. With two young children home during work hours, distractions abounded and Mr. Wilson says he felt isolated from colleagues.\par \par \uc2 So when his job was relocated to Raleigh, N.C., he took a position marketing the company's Watson \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  products at \uc2 IBM\uc2 's Littleton, Mass., campus.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wilson says he was eager to return to an office, a better fit for his "water-cooler guy" personality.\par \par \uc2 He relishes the verbal sparring of the office, too. During a recent meeting to critique \uc2 IBM\uc2 's e-commerce offerings, participants challenged one another and got in each other's faces to make their points\u8212\'20\'14when he attended similar meetings via conference call, people would disengage unless they were leading the conversation, he recalls.\par \par \uc2 IBM\uc2 's leaders want to provoke those creative tensions, and have spent $750 million to redevelop its workplaces around a new system of teamwork; the company has also trained 160,000 employees on working more nimbly.\par \par \uc2 As former telecommuters arrive at \uc2 IBM\uc2 's Austin, Texas, location, Joni Saylor will help to integrate them into office culture. Ms. Saylor, a product design director who worked remotely for \uc2 IBM\uc2  until 2013, says telecommuters sometimes struggle to adjust to working in teams after operating on their own.\par \par \uc2 Best Buy\uc2 's work-from-home program gave 5,000 headquarters employees free rein to choose where they worked, a perk that complicated tasks like scheduling meetings, says Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman.\par \par \uc2 "There was no control," he says. "Managers didn't have the tools to do their jobs."\par \par \uc2 The company ended the policy in 2013. Workers now arrange time out of the office with their managers.\par \par \uc2 The four years since the telework rollback have coincided with \uc2 Best Buy\uc2 's resurgence. Net income has more than doubled in the period and shares have climbed more than 200%, though the company is reluctant to draw a connection between those results and the end of remote work.\par \par \uc2 "Obviously, there were lots of other things going on," Mr. Shelman says.\par \par \uc2 Write to John Simons at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:John.Simons@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 John.Simons@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170725ed7p000xf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Talks between the companies are described as preliminary and one-sided, and any deal would likely be on hold until Uber hires a new chief executive, which isn't expected for weeks, the people said.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  founder \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2  has sought to seize hold of cornerstone technologies he expects to dictate how humans interact with the world for decades to come. As early adopters of self-driving technology, ride-hailing firms are central to Mr. Son's strategy to accelerate a robotic revolution and generate value from his varied investments in semiconductors, networks, cybersecurity and \b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Softbank\uc2  is a big investor in the three largest Asian ride-hailing companies: Singapore's \uc2 GrabTaxi Holdings\uc2  Pte., India's Ola and China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co. On Monday, SoftBank said that it and Didi {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-rival-grabs-fundraising-values-it-at-6-billion-1500867380"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 would lead a $2.5 billion fundraising round }}}\uc2 in Grab, giving the startup more ammunition in its battle against Uber across Southeast Asia.\par \par \uc2 Spokesmen from both Uber and SoftBank declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 While it is rare for SoftBank to hedge its investments, an offer could mean the company hopes Uber combines its operations with Grab and Ola, as it did last year with Didi. Such a merger would give SoftBank a formidable share of the Asian market.\par \par \uc2 Uber, which is struggling with management challenges at home and strong competition from rivals overseas, has shown a willingness to retreat from costly battles around the world. Earlier this month, it said{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-merges-russian-arm-with-yandex-taxi-1499940002"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  it plans to combine its operations with Russian rival}}}\uc2  Yandex.Taxi, owned by \uc2 Yandex NV\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Uber co-founder \uc2 Travis Kalanick{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns-1498023559"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 relinquished his role as chief executive}}}\uc2  last month after investors demanded he step down. His resignation followed a number of scandals as well as an investigation into sexual harassment and sexism at the company. Mr. Kalanick remains on the board.\par \par \uc2 A massive capital injection wouldn't be out of the ordinary for Uber, which has raised more money\u8212\'20\'14about $15 billion in equity and debt funding\u8212\'20\'14than any other private company backed by venture capital. Uber has had to tap increasingly larger sources of capital to support its breakneck global expansion and fight fierce price wars around the U.S. The company's losses last year totaled more than $3 billion, though it still had about $7 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\par \par \uc2 A year ago Uber turned to the Middle East for its biggest single capital infusion, a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia's main investment fund, the \uc2 Public Investment Fund\uc2 . That deal handed an Uber board seat to \uc2 Yasir Al Rumayyan\uc2 , the managing director of PIF who also now sits on the board of SoftBank. The Saudi sovereign-wealth fund is the lead investor in SoftBank's new $93 billion fund that is already starting to shower startups with hundreds of millions of dollars in capital.\par \par \uc2 With the Vision Fund, Mr. Son is likely to wield extensive influence on Silicon Valley and beyond through significant bets in areas such as robotics and \b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  surpasses human capabilities. He has turned SoftBank into one of Japan's biggest companies by making sizable investments in telecommunications, e-commerce and technology, including an early investment in Chinese internet company \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 ., a gamble on U.S. telecommunications company \uc2 Sprint Corp\uc2 . and a buyout of U.K. Microchip designer ARM Holdings PLC.\par \par \uc2 "Many more changes are coming\u8212\'20\'14I am so excited, even sleeping is a waste of time," Mr. Son, 59, said at an event for SoftBank's corporate clients and partners on Thursday. He compared SoftBank's role to that of the landed elites played to enable the industrial revolution. "We want to be the gentry of the IT revolution."\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 's big wagers have tended to greatly inflate startup valuations. The newest investment in Grab, which operates private-car, taxi, motorcycle and carpool bookings across seven countries in Asia, would value the startup at more than $6 billion, according to a person familiar with the situation. That is double the valuation from less than year ago and would make Grab the most valuable startup in Southeast Asia. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 's $5 billion investment in Didi last year catapulted the Chinese startup's valuation to $50 billion from $33 billion.\par \par \uc2 Bloomberg News earlier reported SoftBank's potential interest in buying shares of Uber.\par \par \uc2 Write to Greg Bensinger at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:greg.bensinger@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 greg.bensinger@wsj.com}}}\uc2 , Joann S.

"That's what is exciting about Vicarious."\par \par \uc2 Vicarious Inc., which just closed the Series C round, aims to deliver the robotics industry an AI platform that would make it easier for machines to not only learn to do tasks but also to respond effectively to solve problems autonomously when confronted with "uncertainty."\par \par \uc2 "We want to move the world of robots beyond just one-off scripts for single-purpose work cells to more general-purpose intelligent machines that can do a lot of tasks," said Vicarious co-founder \uc2 D. Scott Phoenix\uc2 , who previously co-founded a touchscreen-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company backed by \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Union City, Calif.-based Vicarious has raised $120 million to date.

Now they're busy playing catch-up.\par \par \uc2 That has proven appetizing to venture capitalists who over the past two years have lined up behind software that helps restaurants manage data surrounding work at the front and back of the house. Products from point-of-sale startups such as \uc2 Revel Systems Inc\uc2 ., Lightspeed POS Inc., and Square Inc. cover platforms for payments, online ordering, inventory control, sales \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and even labor productivity.\par \par \uc2 In the latest sign of venture activity in the segment, Toast Inc. said Tuesday it has closed on $101 million in capital. London-based Generation Investment Management and \uc2 Lead Edge Capital\uc2  led the Series C round, with participation by existing investors including Bessemer Ventures.\par \par \uc2 Customers of Boston-based Toast's platform can manage and analyze data across most facets of the restaurant operation, including loyalty programs, in-restaurant kiosks for customers. It can also help determine which plates are the best-selling items on the menu.\par \par \uc2 "Restaurant operators aren't used to having real-time data right at their fingertips," said Toast Chief Executive Chris Comparato.\par \par \uc2 The startup, founded in 2011, says it has more than 50 midsize and large restaurants, including Mexican food chain Costa Vida, pizzeria Pieology and O'Maddy's Bar & Grille.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comparato declined to provide revenue figures but said the company has seen "fantastic growth" over the past year or two.\par \par \uc2 He said a big factor is the company's decision to allow Toast's platform to accommodate partnerships with companies like delivery startup \uc2 GrubHub\uc2  and loyalty platform Paytronix.\par \par \uc2 "We thought of things right out of the gate that pushed the user experience," Mr. Comparato said, "both for the operator as well as the guest--into one platform."\par \par \uc2 He said the Series C round was oversubscribed but declined to comment on Toast's valuation, which was estimated at $325 million pre-money, according to \uc2 PitchBook Data Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Toast sells Android-based devices and charges a monthly service subscription to restaurants of all sizes throughout North America.\par \par \uc2 Several competing point-of-sale systems largely run on iOS for iPad. Revel has raised more than $127 million in outside funding. \uc2 Oracle\uc2 's Micros and NCR's Aloha also focus on restaurant point of sale. In 2015 \uc2 Lightspeed\uc2  raised $61 million in a Series C round.\par \par \uc2 In another sign of the tech industry's hunger for a slice of the hospitality sector, a startup called BentoBox is offering a website-building service that it says was designed specifically for restaurateurs. The company on Monday said it has raised a $4.8 million Series A round, led by Bullpen Capital.\par \par \uc2 Write to Alexander Davis at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Alec.Davis@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Alec.Davis@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170725ed7p000e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The New York firm, which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aquiline-jeffrey-greenbergs-finance-pe-firm-raises-1-1b-for-third-fund-1459950207"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 closed its third flagship fund}}}\uc2  last year with $1.1 billion, typically targets midmarket companies in financial-services and insurance, often where those industries intersect with the technology sector.\par \par \uc2 Aquiline's desire to invest in a broader swath of companies, along with limited partner interest in early-stage technology deals and insurance technology, led the firm to start building its technology-growth unit late last year.\par \par \uc2 "We believe that having a presence in that market is good for the firm as a whole, good for limited partners and portfolio companies, and good for our general knowledge and awareness in the sector," said Mr. Greenberg.\par \par \uc2 Aquiline recruited Max Chee from venture-capital firm \uc2 Millennium Technology Value Partners\uc2  to lead the new unit, along with \uc2 Michael Cichowski\uc2 , a managing director at a family office who previously worked for growth-equity firm \uc2 Edison Ventures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Aquiline's approach with the new fund "is in some ways parallel to the way we operate in our main funds," said Mr. Greenberg, the former chairman of Marsh & McLennan Cos. and the son of Hank Greenberg, the former chief executive of American Insurance Group Inc. Aquiline, which was founded in 2005, aims for what Mr. Greenberg called "out of the limelight" deals and targets companies that are in position to capitalize on the changes the finance and insurance sector are going through.\par \par \uc2 The Aquiline Technology Growth fund makes minority investments of $3 million to $15 million in companies raising Series A funding up through the growth-equity stage. The firm expects the fund to invest in insurance technology, asset-management technology, benefits and retirement, and other sectors, according to a news release.\par \par \uc2 The new fund has made two investments so far, leading a $6.6 million Series A financing in Carpe Data, which provides customer-data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  for insurance companies; and investing in a home-warranty and concierge-repair company, whose name it hasn't made public.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chee said he expects to see strong deal flow in the insurance-technology sector, which saw a record $985 million in funding volume in the second quarter of this year, including $289 million in early-stage funding, according to a report from Willis \uc2 Towers Watson\uc2 . Mr. Chee also sees opportunities in the industry's adoption of data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  as well as in distribution and middle- and back-office operations.\par \par \uc2 Aquiline recently announced two exits for its midmarket investing strategy. In March, it agreed to sell \uc2 Simply Business\uc2 , a U.K. insurance distributor the firm acquired last year, to Travelers Cos. in a roughly $490 million deal. The firm that month also {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aquiline-sells-compliance-technology-provider-to-factset-for-205-2-million-1490039821"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sold Bisam Technologies SA}}}\uc2 , a French maker of compliance technology for asset managers, to \uc2 FactSet Research Systems Inc\uc2 . for $205.2 million.\par \par \uc2 Write to Chris Cumming at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:chris.cumming@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 chris.cumming@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20170725ed7p0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Over the past 23 years, he has turned one niche offshore insurer into a large and diversified company, become CEO of a big industry brokerage and co-founded his own insurance firm.\par \par \uc2 In returning to \uc2 AIG\uc2 , his plan is straightforward: Expand \uc2 AIG\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He thinks the company has shrunk enough after unloading a series of businesses to help repay a nearly $185 billion \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  bailout and then selling more assets to finance share buybacks. Mr. Duperreault wants to expand in part through acquisitions as well as \uc2 AIG\uc2 's life and personal lines insurance businesses, particularly internationally.\par \par \uc2 "I [was] looking at my alma mater having issues," the 70-year-old said in his first extensive interview since taking the \uc2 AIG\uc2  job in May. "My head was saying, 'Don't do it,' because I had a great job. But my heart was telling me otherwise."\par \par \uc2 Over the past few weeks, Mr. Duperreault has brought in executives from outside the company and plans to increase use of data science and predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , particularly as a way to expand sales to midsize businesses.\par \par \uc2 Many of \uc2 AIG\uc2 's 56,400 employees are now meeting Mr. Duperreault for the first time through town halls in New York, Boston, Chicago, London and Dublin, so far. Among things they are learning: Their new boss has a deep faith. A Roman Catholic who was educated by nuns in Trenton, N.J., he later attended the Jesuit-run St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 "Faith and family are the two things I wanted them to understand about me," he said. "The most important element of running a company is doing the right thing, and faith gives one the courage to do that."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duperreault said he speaks publicly of his religious side "when I am being asked about who I am." He has publicly thanked God for his successes and keeps a Bible in his office for "when I feel that I have to read it."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duperreault didn't initially aim for an insurance career. He went to \uc2 St. Joe\uc2 's to study chemistry, but "I just wasn't any good at lab work." He majored in math, then after college he enlisted in the Army during the Vietnam War and spent three years doing clerical work at Fort Knox, Ky.\par \par \uc2 Upon discharge, job choices were limited with a stalled U.S. economy. Actuaries were in demand.\par \par \uc2 "I didn't know anything about actuarial science," he said. "All I know is, I needed a job."\par \par \uc2 He was hired at \uc2 AIG\uc2 , then a midsize property-casualty insurer, in the early stages of its transformation into one of the world's largest financial-services firms by its CEO, \uc2 Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duperreault's first assignment was to create divorce insurance that would guarantee income should a marriage fail. While that product wasn't launched, he eventually became a key lieutenant of the hard-charging Mr. Greenberg.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duperreault said he left \uc2 AIG\uc2  in 1994 to determine if he had "the wherewithal to stand alone and succeed" without Mr. Greenberg.\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Mr. Greenberg said he is pleased to see Mr. Duperreault back at \uc2 AIG\uc2 , calling him "a good choice." Mr. Greenberg left \uc2 AIG\uc2  in 2005 and now runs insurance and investment firm \uc2 Starr Cos\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duperreault succeeded \uc2 Peter Hancock\uc2 , who lost his hold on the CEO job earlier this year after delaying profit-improvement deadlines. Mr. Hancock had been narrowing \uc2 AIG\uc2 's focus through divestitures.\par \par \uc2 "I think Brian is wise in getting rid of that liquidation strategy," said Mr. Greenberg, referring to Mr. Hancock's divestitures. Turning around \uc2 AIG\uc2  "will take time, and you have to have a strategy to differentiate \uc2 AIG\uc2  from other companies. He's had a lot of training, been in the industry a long time. But time will tell."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duperreault's first job outside of \uc2 AIG\uc2  was as CEO of ACE Ltd., which back then was a liability-insurance specialist. The job returned him to his birthplace: Bermuda, where he was born to American parents. Over the next decade, he diversified and expanded ACE through acquisitions. In 2004, he stepped down as CEO and became nonexecutive chairman.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, he became CEO of then-struggling brokerage and consulting firm \uc2 Marsh & McLennan Cos\uc2 . He cut costs, strengthened management and acquired smaller firms to bolster growth. He left in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The following year, while on a dinner cruise in Hamilton, Bermuda, he mentioned still having "gas in the tank" to insurance executive David Brown. Mr. Brown knew that hedge fund \uc2 Two Sigma Investments\uc2 , a leader in quantitative analysis, was looking to get into insurance, and he put Mr. Duperreault in contact with them.\par \par \uc2 That led to Mr. Duperreault co-founding Hamilton Insurance Group in 2013 with Two Sigma's principals. As part of Mr. Duperreault's new job, a Two Sigma affiliate aims to work with \uc2 AIG\uc2  on an insurance platform.\par \par \uc2 AIG\uc2  today is far different than the one Mr. Duperreault left in 1994. Gone to repay its bailout are Asian life-insurance operations, aircraft leasing and other crown jewels. Also gone are some former rivals such as \uc2 Aetna Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Cigna Corp\uc2 ., which divested property-casualty units. New competition has emerged, including \uc2 Chubb Ltd\uc2 . That insurer is the former ACE and is run by Hank Greenberg's son Evan, who succeeded Mr. Duperreault at ACE.\par \par \uc2 "You need to have great rivalries to make you better," Mr. Duperreault said. "So it's actually a wonderful thing, in a way, that they're out there and they're so good because it's going to make us better."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170725000031"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170725ed7p0000u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 As US bank chief executive pay settles at more than twice the average pay of bank bosses in Europe, shareholders are determined to prevent American norms from crossing the Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 The latest Financial Times bank chief executive pay review shows that the men running \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 , \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  were last year paid 2.1 times as much as Europe's top bank chiefs.\par \par \uc2 That is the first time in at least four years that US pay has been more than double European levels, according to the joint research from the FT and pay consultancy \uc2 Equilar\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Investors are working very hard to contain what they perceive to be a US pay escalation from infecting other geographies," says John Roe, head of \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at \uc2 Institutional Shareholder Services\uc2  , which advises more than 1,700 institutional investors on how to vote at shareholder meetings.\par \par \uc2 "At the behest of" those investors, he adds, \uc2 ISS\uc2  now excludes US companies from the "peer analysis" it does to assess whether executives in Europe, Canada and Asia are being paid in line with industry norms.\par \par \uc2 "Substantially" higher pay levels have long existed in the US for everyone from bankers to "academics, doctors, lawyers (and) IT experts," according to Roman Matousek from Kent Business School.\par \par \uc2 However, \uc2 Paul Lee\uc2 , London-based head of corporate governance at \uc2 Aberdeen Asset Management\uc2 , says European attitudes had recently diverged even further from Americans'.\par \par \uc2 "In the last two years . . . quantum has been on the European agenda in a way that it never used to be," he says. "You used to discuss only pay for performance, with the absolute number being irrelevant."\par \par \uc2 He believes US and European investors now have a fundamentally different outlook - in Europe, where memories of costly bank bailouts are still raw and recent, there is a "social contract" that pay should not go above a certain level. In the US, as Mr Lee diplomatically puts it, "the social contract is different".\par \par \uc2 Andrew Gebelin, of proxy adviser Glass Lewis, which advises investors with $35tn under management, has observed a similar aversion to high pay in Europe. Last year, four US bank chiefs were paid more than $20m between salary, bonuses, pensions and other allowances; in Europe, the highest package was the equivalent of $14m.\par \par \uc2 "If any European bank were to pay its CEO twenty million plus you would have seen that shareholders would go against the say on pay resolution in large numbers," says Mr Gebelin. "It would become immediately relevant in a political context . . . governments naming and shaming individuals to civil society raising awareness of the issue."\par \par \uc2 He believes the fact that European pay is "levelling off or even decreasing in some cases" is "very much a result of engagement with shareholders who are increasingly sceptical about rising level of pay". At \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , where both \uc2 ISS\uc2  and Glass Lewis called on shareholders to reject management's pay proposals, the executive board capitulated and volunteered for a 40 per cent bonus cut.\par \par \uc2 "It does seem that the same kind of pressure is simply not there in the US or that it hasn't paid off yet," says Mr Gebelin.\par \par \uc2 Maryland-based Mr Roe argues that US bank investors are simply more willing to pay. "If a bank is continuing to generate returns and has good ROTCE (return on capital employed) numbers, even twenty million compensation figures or thirty million . . . just doesn't affect earnings," he says.\par \par \uc2 "There is a vision that some of these are Steve Jobs-style CEOs," he adds, describing them as "really, really talented financial managers . . . and very hard to replace". His argument gains credibility from a simple statistic. The US bankers were paid an average of 2.1 times as much as their European rivals. The US banks made an average of almost 7.5 times as much net income as those same European banks last year.\par \par \uc2 The cases of \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  illustrate the point. The French and US banks are similar institutions by many measures. BNP has $2.4tn in assets; \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  has $2.5tn; BNP spans 74 countries, \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  operates in "more than 60". They both have big retail and investment bank arms, as well as related activities such as treasury services and private banking.\par \par \uc2 Described like that, it is hard to understand the almost $24m gap in the pay of JPMorgan chief executive \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  and BNP boss \uc2 Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u233\'00\'E9\uc2  , but \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  had net income of $22.6bn last year, while BNP made $8.5bn.\par \par \uc2 Still, Aberdeen's Mr Lee takes issue with the comparison of Wall Street's best to the man who created the iPod and Apple Mac. "Have they invented an entire consumer market, and taken that market as their own?" he asks. "No, they have inherited very substantial franchises and run them well, but these large banks now require a huge amount of shareholder capital."\par \par \uc2 Mr Lee says the fact that capital demands were now so high made it even less justifiable for big banks to, on average, pay about 40 per cent of their revenues out to staff.\par \par \uc2 And not all US investors are comfortable with rising pay rates - the \uc2 Equilar\uc2  data show that US bank investors have, on average, voted against more bank pay proposals this year than in Europe. In the US, pay votes attracted an average support level of 84 per cent last year; in Europe, 89 per cent of investors voted in favour.\par \par \uc2 Part of the reason may stem from the structure of the packages - an April report from research group Autonomous said US banks "lead the way with clear, easy to understand and focused" long-term incentive plans, calling \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  out for particular praise.\par \par \uc2 As the Eurozone's economy gathers pace, having just recorded its best industrial output in six months, Mr Lee says there is a "religious debate" about whether investors will succeed in keeping pay so far below the US levels.\par \par \uc2 Despite the global nature of the industry, and the international mobility of so many of its workers, Mr Gebelin of Glass Lewis thinks the gap seen in 2016 will persist, or even broaden.\par \par \uc2 "In Europe I would definitely expect a continuing trend of overall payments being capped at where they are now," says Mr Gebelin. "There's quite a big difference on pay going back a few years; we haven't seen top US banks poaching European talent," he adds. "The evidence speaks for itself."\par \par \uc2 The big moneymakers\par \par \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  $191.9m\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\par \par \uc2 Last winter JPMorgan chief executive \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  was approached about one of only a handful of jobs that would make him even more prominent: \uc2 US Treasury\uc2  Secretary.\par \par \uc2 Colleagues say Mr Dimon, who has headed the bank for 11 years, did not even seriously consider the role, such was his love of life at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and his fear that he and President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  would prove a combustible combination. By then, \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  was already riding the trading boom inspired by Mr Trump's election that would help it almost double investment bank profits in the fourth quarter. The bank's annual return on tangible equity came in at 13 per cent for the third year in a row. In his annual letter to shareholders, Mr Dimon promised there were better times to come, citing the "anticipated reversal of many negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment, coupled with our sustained, strong business results". Shares in the bank, which rose almost 13 per cent in 2016, were up another 5 per cent in the first half of 2017.\par \par \uc2 Laura Noonan\par \par \uc2 Brian Moynihan\uc2  $45.6m\par \par \uc2 Bank of America\par \par \uc2 Along with rival \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  was long seen as epitomising the post-crisis collapse in the fortunes of big US banks.\par \par \uc2 Profits were persistently underwhelming as it grappled with a series of regulatory and legal difficulties.\par \par \uc2 Since the US election last November, however, things have been looking up for the bank and its chairman and chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Soon after \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's victory, \uc2 Brian Moynihan\uc2  said optimism among US consumers was "palpable". Since the election shares have leapt 46 per cent, more than any other big six US bank, as investors reckon BofA will be a prime beneficiary of higher interest rates given the scale of its domestic lending business.\par \par \uc2 So far results remain mixed, though. In the first quarter, the bank generated a return on equity of little more than 7 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Alistair Gray\par \par \uc2 Lloyd Blankfein\uc2  $173.5m\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs\par \par \uc2 The first corporate news from \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  in 2016 was a 56 per cent fall in first-quarter earnings, a result that took some of the shine off the bank's reputation as a money printing machine.\par \par \uc2 Goldman rallied quickly, with second-quarter profits up 43 per cent year on year, as investment banks rode high on volatility caused by the UK's Brexit vote and the US presidential elections.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's victory was to claim some of \uc2 Lloyd Blankfein\uc2  's most valued colleagues, including chief operating officer \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , who became chief economic adviser to the new president. With so many Goldmanites in Mr Trump's administration hopes grew that the president would create a more banker-friendly regulatory regime, but such hopes are fading. Meanwhile, Goldman is hedging its bets away from its heartland of investment banking and markets; in October it launched online lending platform Marcus, which had loaned more than $1bn by the end of June.\par \par \uc2 Laura Noonan\par \par \uc2 Sergio Ermotti\uc2  $13.9m\par \par \uc2 UBS\par \par \uc2 UBS\uc2  took the restructuring plunge in 2012, much earlier than other European banks, so the Swiss bank and its chief executive \uc2 Sergio Ermotti\uc2  have been spared some of the turmoil that subsequently hit rivals.\par \par \uc2 But the bank's focus on wealth management meant it benefited less from the lucrative trading boom that this year boosted the pay packages of rival executives. Mr Ermotti believes \uc2 UBS\uc2 's strategy will allow it to keep outperforming over the long term. He still faces hurdles: competition is intensifying to manage money for the richest people in fast-growing Asian economies. Mr Ermotti must also decide whether to follow the example set by \uc2 Barclays\uc2  and refuse a possible US settlement offer over mortgage bond mis-selling. Although he has held the top management job at \uc2 UBS\uc2  since 2011, Mr Ermotti has given few indications he plans to step down any time soon.\par \par \uc2 Ralph Atkins\par \par \uc2 Stuart Gulliver\uc2  $18.7m\par \par \uc2 HSBC\par \par \uc2 Having worked at \uc2 HSBC\uc2  for 37 years and been its chief executive since the start of 2011, \uc2 Stuart Gulliver\uc2  is nearing the end of his career at Europe's biggest bank by market capitalisation.\par \par \uc2 After the board chose to appoint \uc2 Mark Tucker\uc2  from Asian insurer AIA to replace \uc2 Douglas Flint\uc2  as chairman earlier this year, Mr Gulliver told his fellow directors that he planned to step down in 2018. The search for his successor is already under way.\par \par \uc2 Buoyed by a multibillion dollar share buy-back programme its share price has gained more than 50 per cent in the past year, rising back above where it was when Mr Gulliver took charge.\par \par \uc2 But the bank has missed a string of financial targets and its return on equity fell to less than 1 per cent last year, weighed down by the cost of regulation and a restructuring to refocus on promising markets in Asia.\par \par \uc2 Martin Arnold\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170724ed7o0002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The notes were trading at a yield of about 4.8% above the three-month euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, as of July 24, according to FactSet data.\par \par \uc2 "AnaCap has been able to complete this transaction thanks to its longstanding track record in the European debt purchase sector," said Justin Sulger, AnaCap's head of credit investments.\par \par \uc2 In a report published after the bonds were issued earlier this month, Standard & Poor's Global Ratings said the proceeds of the bond issue would be used to buy a portfolio of "seed assets", including performing loans and performing loans that were previously owned by AnaCap's credit funds.\par \par \uc2 AnaCap closed its third credit fund on its \u8364\'20\'AC595 million hard cap in June 2016. At the time the firm said the strategy would "target performing, semi-performing or nonperforming credit assets comprising primarily consumer, SME and mortgage debt across Europe."\par \par \uc2 The transaction is the latest evidence of strong investor appetite for European banks' loan books. \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2 's credit arm this month agreed to buy two portfolios of nonperforming and subperforming real-estate assets, worth nearly $1 billion between them, from Portuguese lender \uc2 Caixa Geral de Dep\u243\'00\'F3sitos\uc2  SA and Spain's \uc2 Banco Ibercaja SA\uc2 . Pillarstone, a platform set up by \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 ., received a license to manage Greek banks' nonperforming loans in May.\par \par \uc2 S&P gave AnaCap Financial Europe a preliminary rating of BB-, saying the below-investment-grade rating reflects the new vehicle's "lack of operational track record under the new structure, its limited scale relative to rated debt purchasing peers, and its narrow business profile."\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, S&P noted AnaCap Financial Europe's "good market position in its primary markets, its ability to leverage the financial services expertise of \uc2 AnaCap Financial Partners\uc2 ; and its relatively low leverage and good debt-servicing."\par \par \uc2 Other private-equity backed debt-collection companies include Cabot Financial, a J.C. Flowers & Co. portfolio company, and Sweden's \uc2 Intrum Justitia\uc2 , which \uc2 Nordic Capital\uc2  agreed to buy in 2016.\par \par \uc2 The ratings agency said 60% of AnaCap Financial Europe's revenue will come from Italy, where it owns nine loan portfolios with a face value of \u8364\'20\'AC7.3 billion. Spain and Portugal will account for 15% each, with further contributions coming from Romania and the U.K.\par \par \uc2 In its news release, AnaCap said a "valuable component" of AnaCap Financial Europe's strategy is a proprietary intelligence gathering platform, dubbed Minerva, that AnaCap uses to inform its loan origination, pricing and debt servicing decisions across its portfolio. S&P said AnaCap's data mining and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  capabilities could help the new vehicle underwrite new investments.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ed Ballard at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ed.ballard@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ed.ballard@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20170724ed7o000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

In the US, as Mr Lee diplomatically puts it,\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Cthe social contract is different\u8221\'20\'1D.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Andrew Gebelin, of proxy adviser Glass Lewis, which advises investors with $35tn under management, has observed a similar aversion to high pay in Europe. Last year, four US bank CEOs were paid more than $20m between salary, bonuses, pensions and other allowances; in Europe, the highest package was the equivalent of $14m.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf any European bank were to pay its CEO $20m-plus you would have seen that shareholders would go against the say on pay resolution in large numbers,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Gebelin. \u8220\'20\'1CIt would become immediately relevant in a political context\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09governments naming and shaming individuals to civil society raising awareness of the issue.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 He believes the fact that European pay is\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Clevelling off or even decreasing in some cases\u8221\'20\'1D is \u8220\'20\'1Cvery much a result of engagement with shareholders who are increasingly sceptical about rising level of pay\u8221\'20\'1D. At \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , where both \uc2 ISS\uc2  and Glass Lewis called on shareholders to reject management\u8217\'20\'19s pay proposals, the executive board capitulated and volunteered for a 40 per cent bonus cut.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt does seem that the same kind of pressure is simply not there in the US or that it hasn\u8217\'20\'19t paid off yet,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Gebelin.\par \par \uc2 Maryland-based Mr Roe argues that US bank investors are simply more willing to pay.\u160\'00\'A0\u8221\'20\'1DIf a bank is continuing to generate returns and has good ROTCE (return on capital employed) numbers, even $20m compensation figures or $30m\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09just doesn\u8217\'20\'19t affect earnings,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a vision that some of these are Steve Jobs-style CEOs\u8221\'20\'1D, he adds, describing them as\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Creally, really talented financial managers\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09and very hard to replace\u8221\'20\'1D. His argument gains credibility from a simple statistic. The US bankers were paid an average of 2.1 times as much as their European rivals. The US banks made an average of almost 7.5 times as much net income as those same European banks last year.\par \par \uc2 The cases of\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  illustrate the point. The French and American banks are similar institutions by many measures. BNP has $2.4tn in assets; \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  has $2.5tn; BNP spans 74 countries, \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  operates in \u8220\'20\'1Cmore than 60\u8221\'20\'1D. They both have big retail and investment bank arms, as well as related activities such as treasury services and private banking.\par \par \uc2 Described like that, it is hard to understand the almost $24m gap in the pay of JPMorgan CEO \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  and BNP boss \uc2 Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u233\'00\'E9\uc2 . The figures make more sense when you consider that \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  had net income of $22.6bn last year, while BNP made $8.5bn.\par \par \uc2 Still, Aberdeen\u8217\'20\'19s Mr Lee takes issue with the comparison of Wall Street\u8217\'20\'19s best to the man who created the iPod and Apple Mac. "Have they invented an entire consumer market, and taken that market as their own?\u8221\'20\'1D he asks. \u8220\'20\'1CNo, they have inherited very substantial franchises and run them well, but these large banks now require a huge amount of shareholder capital."\par \par \uc2 Mr Lee says the fact that capital demands were now so high made it even less justifiable for big banks to, on average, pay about 40 per cent of their revenues out to staff.\par \par \uc2 And certainly, not all US investors are comfortable with rising pay rates \u8212\'20\'14 the \uc2 Equilar\uc2  data shows that US bank investors have, on average, voted against more bank pay proposals this year than in Europe.\u160\'00\'A0In the US, pay votes attracted an average support level of 84 per cent last year; in Europe, 89 per cent of investors voted in favour.\par \par \uc2 Part of the reason for that may stem from the structure of the packages \u8212\'20\'14 an April report from research group Autonomous said US banks \u8220\'20\'1Clead the way with clear, easy to understand and focused\u8221\'20\'1D long-term incentive plans, naming \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  for particular praise.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 As the Eurozone\u8217\'20\'19s economy gathers pace, having just recorded its best industrial output in six months, Mr Lee says there is a\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Creligious debate\u8221\'20\'1D about whether investors will succeed in their quest to keep pay so far below the US levels.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Despite the global nature of the financial services industry, and the international mobility of so many of its workers, Mr Gebelin of Glass Lewis thinks the gap seen in 2016 will persist, or even broaden.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn Europe I would definitely expect a continuing trend of overall payments being capped at where they are now,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Gebelin.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s quite a big difference on pay going back a few years, we haven\u8217\'20\'19t seen top US banks poaching European talent,\u8221\'20\'1D he adds. \u8220\'20\'1CThe evidence speaks for itself.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170723ed7n002p9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Times are tough for skeptics of the bull market.\par \par \uc2 Flummoxed by the endurance of a 2017 rally that produced its 27th S&P 500 record this week, investors are backing off bets that major indexes are headed downward.\par \par \uc2 Bets against the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund, the largest ETF tracking the broad index, fell to $38.9 billion last week, the lowest level of short interest since May 2013, and remained near those levels this week, according to financial-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm S3 Partners. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, expecting to repurchase them at lower prices and collect the difference as profit.\par \par \uc2 Bearish investors say they are scaling back on these bets not because their view of the market has fundamentally changed, but because it is difficult to stick to a money-losing strategy when it seems stocks can only go up.\par \par \uc2 They believe the market moves are at odds with an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gdp-rose-0-7-in-first-quarter-1493382900"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 economy that remains lukewarm}}}\uc2  as it enters its ninth year of growth, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stock-valuations-flash-a-warning-sign-1471189314"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 stock valuations that are historically high}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/05/17/the-trump-trade-is-done/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a delay of business-friendly policies in Washington}}}\uc2  like tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\par \par \uc2 "There seems to be an overall view that people are invincible, that things will always go up, that there are no risks and no matter what goes on, no matter what foolishness is in play, people don't care," said Marc Cohodes, whose hedge fund focused on shorting stocks closed in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cohodes is now a chicken farmer based in California who is looking to get into goat herding in Canada. He shorts a handful of individual stocks personally, but isn't focused on the broader market.\par \par \uc2 The practice of shorting companies is also going by the wayside as stocks continue to notch records. Short-biased hedge funds had $4.3 billion in assets at the end of March, down from $7.1 billion at the end of 2013, according to HFR Inc.\par \par \uc2 The difficulty for stock-market bears stems from a Goldilocks-like market environment, in which the economy is expanding fast enough to support corporate earnings, but slow enough {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-faces-inflation-conundrum-1500496541"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 for the Federal Reserve to keep rates relatively low}}}\uc2 . Years of low rates and easy-money policies have boosted stocks, defying forecasts for a steep, prolonged downturn.\par \par \uc2 "The shorts have been frustrated now for quite a while," said \uc2 Scott Minerd\uc2 , global chief investment officer at \uc2 Guggenheim Partners\uc2 , which has $260 billion in assets under management. The scenarios that might lead to a payout for market bears\u8212\'20\'14an economic recession or a sharp rise in interest rates\u8212\'20\'14don't seem imminent, either, Mr. Minerd added.\par \par \uc2 In one sign of capitulation among the bears, stock pullbacks have been getting shorter.\par \par \uc2 This year, there have been two times when the S&P 500 has closed down 1% or more. After these two selloffs, it has taken stocks an average of 14.5 days to recoup losses. That is well below the 25.5 days it took on average to bounce back from stretches of 1%-plus selloffs in 2016 and the 80 days it took to rebound in 2015, according to an analysis by WSJ Market Data Group.\par \par \uc2 The share of individual investors who are either bullish or bearish has also fallen in recent months, according to a weekly survey by the \uc2 American Association of Individual Investors\uc2 , while the share of those who are neutral has risen. As of the end of June, 43% of investors said they were neutral\u8212\'20\'14the most since last August.\par \par \uc2 "The danger is that you're too early getting out," said \uc2 Ernesto Ramos\uc2 , head of equities at \uc2 BMO Global Asset Management\uc2 , which has $246 billion under management.\par \par \uc2 The issue for investors, Mr. Ramos said, is that there remain few compelling alternatives to stocks.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weak-inflation-continues-to-hold-down-bond-yields-1498906802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bond yields have remained stubbornly low this year}}}\uc2 , with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ending Friday at 2.232%, down from 2.446% at the end of 2016.\par \par \uc2 Central banks around the world in recent weeks have signaled {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecbs-draghi-says-hes-in-no-rush-to-end-easy-money-1498556533"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 they will move toward normalizing monetary policy}}}\uc2 , nudging bond yields higher. But few investors believe inflation will pick up so much that the Fed will be pressured into lifting rates faster than it has forecast\u8212\'20\'14a scenario that could lead to sharp market losses.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, many who are invested in stocks are wary of signs that the bull market's days are numbered.\par \par \uc2 Valuations have risen to levels many investors say are stretched, with the S&P 500 trading this week at 17.86 times the next 12 months of expected earnings, according to FactSet, above its 10-year average of 14.06 times forward earnings.\par \par \uc2 Still, some who believe excesses are growing in the financial system say it is hard to convey those concerns to average investors. While signs of a housing bubble in the middle part of the last decade were abundant, indications that borrowing by companies will lead to a wave of defaults are more nuanced, said Albert Edwards, a strategist at \uc2 Soci\u233\'00\'E9t\u233\'00\'E9 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale SA\uc2 . Mr. Edwards has been bearish for most of the bull market and believes a corporate-debt binge will ultimately lead to a deeper bear market than in the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 "It's much harder this time to see the corporate-debt excesses," he said. "It's not a headline catcher. You have to be a bit geeky to pull apart the data and analyze it."\par \par \uc2 Despite persistent concerns that investment-grade corporate bonds and junk debt are pricey, a \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2  survey of credit investors found that none of the respondents were significantly underweight either sector.\par \par \uc2 In the week ended July 19, investors piled $4.6 billion into global equity funds, marking the eighth consecutive week of inflows for such funds, according to EPFR data.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lot of worry out there, but the market just keeps going up," Mr. Ramos said. "When everyone agrees that it's time for this bull market to keep going, that's exactly the right time for the market rally to stop."\par \par \uc2 Peter Levin and Charley Grant contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ben Eisen at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ben.eisen@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ben.eisen@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Akane Otani at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:akane.otani@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 akane.otani@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Read More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-is-no-bubble-but-the-stock-market-might-be-1500572064"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Streetwise: Tech Is No Bubble, But the Stock Market Might Be}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-are-the-dips-the-weird-unsettling-rise-of-global-stocks-this-year-1500456603"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Markets' 2017 Climb Defies Historic Odds}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/07/17/dow-transports-say-this-rally-could-keep-truckin/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Dow Transports Say This Rally Could Keep Truckin'}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170721ed7l000up\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SPRING HILL, Tenn.\u8212\'20\'14When real-estate agent Don Nugent listed a three-bedroom, two-bath house here on Jo Ann Drive, offers came immediately, including a $208,000 one from a couple with a young child looking for their first home.\par \par \uc2 A competing bid was too attractive to pass up. \uc2 American Homes 4 Rent\uc2 , a public company that had been scooping up homes in the neighborhood, offered the same amount\u8212\'20\'14but all cash, no inspection required.\par \par \uc2 Twelve hours after the house went on the market in April, the Agoura Hills, Calif.-based real-estate investment trust signed a contract. About a month later, it put the house back on the market, this time for rent, for $1,575 a month.\par \par \uc2 A new breed of homeowners has arrived in this middle-class suburb of Nashville and in many other communities around the country: big investment firms in the business of offering single-family homes for rent. Their appearance has shaken up sales and rental markets and, in some neighborhoods, sparked rent increases.\par \par \uc2 On Jo Ann Drive alone, \uc2 American Homes 4 Rent\uc2  owns seven homes, property records indicate. In all of Spring Hill, four firms\u8212\'20\'14American Homes, \uc2 Colony Starwood Homes\uc2 , Progress Residential and Streetlane Homes\u8212\'20\'14own nearly 700 houses, according to tax rolls. That amounts to about 5% of all the houses in town, a 2016 census indicates, and roughly three-quarters of those available for rent, according to Lisa Wurth, president of the local Realtors' association.\par \par \uc2 Those four companies and others like them have become big landlords in other Nashville suburbs, and in neighborhoods outside Atlanta, Phoenix and a couple dozen other metropolitan areas. All told, big investors have spent some $40 billion buying about 200,000 houses, renovating them and building rental-management businesses, estimates real-estate research firm \uc2 Green Street Advisors LLC\uc2 . Still, they own less than 2% of all U.S. rental homes, according to Green Street.\par \par \uc2 The buying spree amounts to a huge bet that the homeownership rate, which currently is hovering around a five-decade low, will stay low and that rents will continue to rise. The investors also are wagering that many people no longer see owning a home as an essential part of the American dream.\par \par \uc2 "The rental stigma has really subsided," says \uc2 Michael Cook\uc2 , operations chief at closely held Streetlane Homes, which owns about 4,000 houses. "People are realizing that houses are not necessarily the best places to store wealth."\par \par \uc2 For many years, the rental-home business was dominated by small businesses and mom-and-pop investors, most of whom owned just a property or two. Big investment firms concentrated on other real-estate sectors\u8212\'20\'14apartment buildings, office towers, shopping centers and warehouses\u8212\'20\'14reasoning that single-family homes were too difficult to acquire en masse and unwieldy to manage and maintain.\par \par \uc2 That all began to change during the financial crisis a decade ago. Swaths of suburbia were sold on courthouse steps after millions of Americans defaulted on mortgages. Veteran real-estate investors raced to buy tens of thousands of deeply discounted houses, often sight unseen. The big buyers included investors \uc2 Thomas Barrack Jr\uc2 . and \uc2 Barry Sternlicht\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14who later {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-landlords-in-talks-to-merge-betting-on-rising-rents-1442808003"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 merged their rental-home holdings to create Colony Starwood}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2 , the world's largest private-equity firm, and self-storage magnate \uc2 B. Wayne Hughes\uc2 , who is behind American Homes.\par \par \uc2 On the first Tuesday of each month during the crisis, investors sent bidders to foreclosure auctions around Atlanta, where the foreclosure rate exceeded 3% in 2011, according to real-estate \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 CoreLogic Inc\uc2 . They toted duffels stuffed with millions of dollars in cashier's checks made out in various denominations so they wouldn't have to interrupt their buying sprees with trips to the bank, according to people who participated in the auctions.\par \par \uc2 Similar scenes played out in Phoenix, where the foreclosure rate hit 5% in late 2010, and in Las Vegas, where it nearly reached 10%.\par \par \uc2 The big investors accumulated tens of thousands of houses around those cities and others, including Dallas, Chicago and all over Florida, then got to work sprucing them up to rent. Often, renovations were major. \uc2 Invitation Homes Inc\uc2 ., the company {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-as-landlord-blackstone-going-public-with-a-10-billion-bet-on-foreclosed-homes-1481020202"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Blackstone created to manage its rental homes and took public in January}}}\uc2 , says it spent an average of $25,000 fixing up each of the foreclosed homes it bought.\par \par \uc2 The bulk-buying brought blighted properties back to life and helped speed the recovery of some of the regions hardest hit by the housing crisis. Executives at the investment firms say they offer homes in good school districts to families that may not be able to buy in those neighborhoods because of damaged credit and tighter postcrisis lending standards.\par \par \uc2 One of those firms, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-onetime-housing-skeptic-plans-1-billion-bet-on-homes-1475619217"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Progress Residential, is owned by a private-equity firm formed by Donald Mullen Jr.}}}\uc2 , a former \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . mortgage chief who oversaw the bank's lucrative bet against the housing market a decade ago. Progress now owns about 20,000 houses.\par \par \uc2 On a call with investors earlier this year, Mr. Mullen said Progress was betting that much of the middle class will have to rent if it wants to maintain the suburban lifestyle of the past. He said Progress offers "aspirational living experience" to tenants he described as typically about 38 years old and married, with a child or two, annual income of about $88,000, less-than-stellar FICO credit scores of 665 and $45,000 of debt. "Our residents are quite a ways away from being able to purchase a home," he said.\par \par \uc2 Home prices in many markets are nearing their 2006 peaks, prompting some investors who bought homes during the downturn to flip them at a profit. But the big buy-to-rent investors are hanging on to their properties and looking to grow.\par \par \uc2 With fewer foreclosure properties available to buy, those firms have devised other ways to accumulate homes, including buying out rivals, building homes themselves, and buying properties one-by-one on the open market. They are focusing on places where they have gained scale through early foreclosure purchases, or around booming cities such as Nashville, Denver and Seattle.\par \par \uc2 With family renters in mind, they rarely consider anything smaller than a three-bedroom. They prefer easy-to-maintain newer homes in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-hot-housing-market-starter-homes-1494495003"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 entry-level price ranges}}}\uc2  and in neighborhoods governed by homeowners associations, which can help look after their properties. They often outfit their homes with the same appliances, fixtures and flooring so that their maintenance crews have parts on hand when they make house calls.\par \par \uc2 They have deep pockets and are dispassionate buyers, paying with cash and never fussing over the carpet or paint color.\par \par \uc2 Spring Hill is about an hour's drive south of downtown Nashville. It has attracted investors for the same reasons families flock there. It boasts top-rated schools and has been adding jobs at one of the fastest clips in the country.\par \par \uc2 General Motors Co\uc2 . kick-started the town's growth in 1990 when it opened a vast plant for its now-defunct Saturn brand. The population has grown from about 1,500 back then to some 36,000 today, with subdivisions covering what had once been farmland.\par \par \uc2 American Homes arrived in 2012, the year after it was founded by Mr. Hughes, now 83 years old, who made billions in the self-storage business, and David Singelyn, who is the company's chief executive. Mr. Hughes told {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-crude-collapsed-alaska-capitalized-on-the-u-s-housing-bust-1479038410"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 one of his earliest investors, Alaska's state oil fund}}}\uc2 , that he imagined the sort of tenants he wanted\u8212\'20\'14families with school-age children\u8212\'20\'14and then went looking for suitable houses in good school districts.\par \par \uc2 Nashville's foreclosure rate never exceeded 2%, so American Homes approached a local builder, John Maher, who had been renting unsold homes in his subdivisions. The company bought about 50 homes from him and later paid about $10 million for 42 rental homes in the area from local landlord Bruce McNeilage and his partners. Then it enlisted local brokers to find more.\par \par \uc2 Colony Starwood and Progress followed. The proliferation of rental homes spooked owners in some neighborhoods. A few subdivisions voted on whether cap the number of homes that could be rented, but the proposals failed.\par \par \uc2 "People want to sell their homes to the highest bidder, no matter who it is, and they want to be able to rent their home," says Jamie Shipley, president of the Wakefield Homeowners Association, which governs a subdivision in which 11% of the homes are owned by institutional investors.\par \par \uc2 Soon after American Homes closed its deal with Mr. McNeilage, the local landlord, it increased rents on some of the properties by hundreds of dollars a month, according to Mr. McNeilage and some of his former tenants. "People who were on month-to-month leases got a real rude awakening," he says.\par \par \uc2 American Homes, which owns more than 48,000 houses nationwide, controls nearly half of Spring Hill's rental homes, leaving aggrieved renters limited choices. "If you want to be in that subdivision and have your kids go to that elementary school, you have to deal with them," Mr. McNeilage says.\par \par \uc2 Jack Corrigan\uc2 , American Homes' operations chief, says rent increases for tenants renewing leases average 3% to 3.5%, and the company generally restricts larger hikes to new leases. "We try to be very reasonable with all of our tenants," he says.\par \par \uc2 When Aaron Waldie moved to Spring Hill for a job in the finance department of a new hospital, he and his wife, Jessica, intended to use profits from selling their California home to buy a new house. Despite offering thousands of dollars above asking prices, the couple lost several bidding wars and settled for a rental owned by Colony Starwood. "It's a lot more expensive than homeownership," he said.\par \par \uc2 To assess how rents sought by Spring Hill's big four corporate owners compare with the monthly costs of owning the same properties, The Wall Street Journal analyzed information from the companies' marketing materials and county sales records for 27 homes purchased by the four since the beginning of March. The analysis\u8212\'20\'14which assumed 10% down payments and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, plus taxes and insurance\u8212\'20\'14found the posted rents on those homes averaged 32% more than the monthly ownership cost.\par \par \uc2 The average rent for 148 single-family homes in Spring Hill owned by the big four landlords was about $1,773 a month, according to online listings since early May viewed by the Journal. Other landlords also have raised rents, local brokers say.\par \par \uc2 "The rent is crazy," says Bruce Hull, Spring Hill's vice mayor and owner of a local home-inspection business. "It hasn't been that long since you could get a three bedroom, two bath for $1,000 a month."\par \par \uc2 At a recent conference in New York, Mr. Singelyn, the American Homes CEO, told investors that the average household income declared by those applying to rent from American Homes had risen to $91,000, from $86,000 a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 "Their wherewithal to pay rent today as well as pay rent in the future, with increases, is sufficient," he said. "It's just up to us to educate tenants on a new way, that there will be annual rent increases. This has been a very passively managed industry for 30, 40 years up until institutional players came in."\par \par \uc2 When rents are significantly higher than the cost of ownership, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-time-home-buyers-show-more-interest-in-market-1500033602"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 renters tend to become house hunters}}}\uc2 . Builders who were sidelined during the recession are rushing to catch up to demand. Spring Hill issued more than 1,100 residential building permits for single-family homes since 2015, and over the past year its planning commission has rezoned and subdivided properties to accommodate thousands more, according to municipal records.\par \par \uc2 David Bowater and his fianc\u233\'00\'E9e were priced out of Spring Hill when the rent on their two-bedroom townhouse rose to about $1,100, from $875, over four years. "It's cheaper to buy at this point," Mr. Bowater says.\par \par \uc2 After bidding on six homes, they won the seventh. The house is even deeper into the middle Tennessee countryside and farther from the restaurants where they work. Mr. Bowater says it is costing him about $100 a month more to own the home than he was paying in rent on the townhouse, but that it is far cheaper than it would be to rent a comparable home with a yard.\par \par \uc2 "We had to make a big offer," he said.

The majority understand the risk to their operations from business interruption, and have modeled the impact of losing critical data assets, perhaps even establishing a cost of such an event.\par \par \uc2 But trying to model larger events is not something most enterprises have undertaken.\par \par \uc2 Lloyd's of London\uc2 , the specialist insurance market, and Cyence, a cybersecurity and risk \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company, this week released a report focused on the potential economic impact of large-scale cyber events. The report highlights how little thinking has been done to model mass losses.\par \par \uc2 Cyberinsurance companies doubtless have a challenge to provide policies that give adequate coverage at a reasonable premium. One of the key issues for insurers is the lack of data available to use in risk modeling; there simply are no long-term authoritative data sources. Adoption of cyberinsurance is growing, but is not yet pervasive.\par \par \uc2 In contrast to car insurance, where there is decades of data about drivers, geographies, types of vehicle and crime, the same does not exist in the cyber realm. A lack of incident disclosure exacerbates the situation.\par \par \uc2 Only once cyberinsurance becomes the norm, or obligatory, will insurers start to understand the risk to discrete organizations far better. Indeed, Lloyd's notes that cyberinsurance is very similar to coverage for natural disasters \u8211\'20\'13 risks are growing and insurance penetration figures are low.\par \par \uc2 The two scenarios raised by Lloyd's--one centered on disruption to a cloud services provider, the second related to mass-exploitation of a software vulnerability--both resulted in loss aggregation running into billions of dollars. In an extreme case of a cloud service provider being seriously disrupted--an outage of between 55 hours and almost six days--the headline cost of the incident was $53 billion, comparable to 2012's Hurricane Sandy that is assessed to have cost the U.S. economy between $50 billion and 70 billion.\par \par \uc2 Continuity Complexity\par \par \uc2 Typically, organizations struggle with business continuity when it comes to cybersecurity. Thinking beyond the boundaries of your own network is tough, not least because it is difficult to understand third party dependencies and interconnected risks. Understanding how a business would cope following an outage of a few hours is one thing, an outage of a few days creates a host of other, far more complex issues.\par \par \uc2 If organizations struggle to model how a cloud service provider outage would impact their business, understanding the systemic risk from vulnerabilities in software is in a different league altogether.\par \par \uc2 A vulnerability in software in widespread use could be exploited by attackers with catastrophic effects. Lloyd's estimate direct economic losses of $28.7 billion for an extreme event, according to their scenario, but this could be just the tip of the iceberg. Outages for extended periods could conceivably cause mass panic, especially if electric grids and banking go offline.\par \par \uc2 Lloyd's draw attention to the fact many companies are not covered for this type of incident.\par \par \uc2 On the upside, there are very few attackers capable of finding and executing an attack of this sort. The ramifications would be global, meaning it would not be in the interests of a nation state to conduct such an attack. Terrorists do not have capability, despite the intention to cause economic damage to developed economies.\par \par \uc2 Jake Kouns, chief executive of Risk Based Security Inc., a technical security consultancy that has recently conducted research in the area of systemic risk, said recognition of the issue is not a problem, but taking action is more difficult.\par \par \uc2 "There simply is no mitigation for individual companies," he said. "Enterprise risk management committees think about systemic risk until \u8216\'20\'18cyber' becomes part of the discussion, at which point conversation grinds to a halt and no actions are agreed."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kouns referenced the October 2016 attack on Dyn Inc., which crippled the system for looking up internet addresses and effectively rendered many website offline, as an example of what could go wrong. That attack, caused by a denial of service attack from internet-of-things devices lasted only a few hours.\par \par \uc2 "The websites were still online, but no one could access them because the protocol directing the traffic was broken," said Mr. Kouns. Insurance doesn't typically cover that sort of business interruption. He added that \u8216\'20\'18availability' of networks did not always live within the security function and therefore was not always something on the chief information security officer's radar.\par \par \uc2 (Rob Sloan is cybersecurity research director at WSJ Pro. Previously, Rob has worked as response director for a specialist IT security consultancy in London and built a team focused on detecting, investigating and protecting against cyber intrusions and responding to incidents, especially state-sponsored attacks. Rob started his career working for the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2 , looking at some of the earliest cyberattacks against the critical national infrastructure. Rob's main interest is the requirements, motivations and technical capabilities of threat actors.)\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20170720ed7k00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Oil prices are having a tough year. So are some commodity traders.\par \par \uc2 Major commodity players such as banks and hedge funds have stumbled, as low volatility and a faltering oil recovery derailed returns during the first half. The S&P GSCI commodity index slumped 10.2% in that period, the worst first-half performance since 2010.\par \par \uc2 Part of the trouble comes from a lack of volatility this year that has made trading more challenging, traders said. Range-bound markets offer little opportunity for investors and traders to profit from major price moves and arbitrage divergences.\par \par \uc2 Low volatility also leads to less demand from clients who want to lock in prices or investors looking to bet on market trends, both major components of banks' commodities businesses. While commodity prices have rebounded slightly in July -- the S&P GSCI index was up 0.2% this month through Tuesday -- a snapback in price swings hasn't occurred.\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., historically a major commodity trader, reported its worst-ever quarter for commodities trading in its earnings report Tuesday. "Commodities is a story of challenges on all fronts," Chief Financial Officer \uc2 R. Martin Chavez\uc2  said on a conference call after the release. When trading revenue fell during the first quarter from a year earlier, the bank had also blamed trading in currencies, commodities and corporate bonds.\par \par \uc2 Bank revenue from commodities broadly has been on a decline. Global revenue from commodities at the 12 biggest investment banks totaled $4.3 billion in the 2016 fiscal year, down from a peak of $14.5 billion in 2008, according to research and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Coalition Development Ltd., which measures trading and financing revenue.\par \par \uc2 Increased regulation has caused Wall Street banks to retreat in recent years from commodities, including activities in physical oil and gas.\par \par \uc2 An unexpected drop-off in oil prices this year has contributed to the malaise, after many banks and hedge funds had expected gains.\par \par \uc2 Veteran oil traders such as Pierre Andurand and Andrew Hall, both hedge-fund managers, lost money this year after betting that production cuts among members of the \uc2 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\uc2  would boost oil prices, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2 , energy's performance has lagged behind the returns of other commodities by the most in 27 years. The S&P GSCI Energy Total Return index lost 18.8% in 2017 through June 30, marking the sector's worst start to the year since 1998.\par \par \uc2 "Overall, the trading market is a little bit tricky right now," said Marc Fontaine, an independent consultant and former head of commodity derivatives for the Americas at \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2 . "There is a lot less volatility, and that makes it much more difficult not just for the \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 's of the world but the large merchants like Mercuria to trade and to trade well."\par \par \uc2 Returns from commodity-trading advisers, funds that trade futures including commodity contracts often based on market trends, have also suffered this year. \uc2 Societe Generale\uc2 's SG CTA Index, which tracks performance of the funds, is down 3.45% this year through June, the worst first-half return since 2011. While CTAs trade futures in all asset classes, some in the sector attribute losses to a lack of major moves in commodities.\par \par \uc2 "You get a market where you're bullish at the top and bearish at the bottom. And those are tough markets to trade," said Tai Wong, head of metals trading at \uc2 BMO Capital Markets\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Among longer-term investors, the lackluster returns in oil and other commodities have damped enthusiasm. Net flows into commodities in the first half totaled $9.5 billion, an 86% drop from the first half of 2016 when net inflows totaled $69.8 billion, according to \uc2 RBC Capital Markets\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "As we see the oil price continue to decline . . . we definitely see a lot of negative sentiment in commodities," said Darwei Kung, portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion Deutsche Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund.\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds and other speculative investors have pared their bullish bets on crude-oil futures after they reached a record high earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at \uc2 J.P. Morgan Asset Management\uc2 , said the drop in oil prices has prompted clients to focus more on holding commodities as an inflation hedge and a tool for diversification, rather than look for price gains. Ms. Kemery also sees more opportunities in soft commodities and industrial metals, which may benefit from an improved macroeconomic outlook. "What it has done is make our investors turn back to basics," she said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170719000039"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170719ed7k0000v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Starr Cos\uc2 ., an insurance and investment firm run by \uc2 Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg\uc2 , has acquired a minority stake in CoverWallet, a New York startup that aims to speed up the insurance-buying process with data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Starr's investment is the latest deal in a hot corner of "insure tech": the market for insuring small businesses, worth $100 billion in annual premiums.\par \par \uc2 Financial terms weren't disclosed.\par \par \uc2 CoverWallet, launched last year by technology entrepreneurs, focuses largely on the market of online issuance of policies and related services to small businesses.\par \par \uc2 Historically, many large insurers avoided small businesses because of the costs of dealing with them individually. Quantitative analysis is changing that, and suddenly a lot of big-name insurers want to sell to local retailers, coffee shops, contractors and other small businesses.\par \par \uc2 These firms believe that algorithms work well for the standardized policies used by many small businesses.\par \par \uc2 "Change is inevitable," Mr. Greenberg, 92 years old, said in an interview. "There is no stopping that."\par \par \uc2 Last year, $1.7 billion was invested in 179 insure tech deals of various sorts, according to CB Insights, a firm with a venture-capital database.\par \par \uc2 Entrepreneurs with engineering and other computer-related backgrounds say the insurance industry is ripe for innovation because of its reliance on traditional ways of doing business even as consumers increasingly favor online financial transactions.\par \par \uc2 Because of advances in computer \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , scientists can feed millions of data points into computers to find patterns. In general, algorithms can draw on publicly available data such as construction features of a business's premises, proximity to fire hydrants and code violations.\par \par \uc2 James Ermilio, CoverWallet's president of insurance, said the firm's goal is using "data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , data science and predictive modeling to make it easy for small businesses to understand, buy and manage their insurance."\par \par \uc2 Large sets of data, cloud computing and sophisticated algorithms operate behind the scenes, while the firm's services are available to customers around the clock online and through smartphones, CoverWallet said.\par \par \uc2 CoverWallet previously raised about$10 million from investors including \uc2 Union Square Ventures\uc2 , \uc2 Index Ventures\uc2  and \uc2 Two Sigma Investments\uc2 'Two Sigma Ventures division.\par \par \uc2 Among other insurers using predictive analysis to issue policies to small businesses is \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 ., which Mr. Greenberg used to run. Last year, \uc2 AIG\uc2  entered a joint venture with Two Sigma, a hedge fund that is a leader in quantitative analysis.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20170719000024"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020170719ed7k0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Oil prices are having a tough year. So are some commodity traders.\par \par \uc2 Major commodity players such as banks and hedge funds have stumbled, as low volatility and a faltering oil recovery derailed returns during the first half. The S&P GSCI commodity index slumped 10.2% in that period, the worst first-half performance since 2010.\par \par \uc2 Part of the troubles come from a lack of volatility this year that has made trading more challenging, traders said. Range-bound markets offer little opportunity for investors and traders to profit from major price moves and arbitrage divergences.\par \par \uc2 Low volatility also leads to less demand from clients who want to lock in prices or investors looking to bet on market trends, both major components of banks' commodities businesses. While commodity prices have rebounded slightly in July\u8212\'20\'14the S&P GSCI index is up 0.2% so far this month\u8212\'20\'14a snapback in price swings hasn't occurred.\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., historically a major commodity trader, reported its worst-ever quarter for commodities trading in its earnings report Tuesday. "Commodities is a story of challenges on all fronts," Chief Financial Officer \uc2 R. Martin Chavez\uc2  said on a conference call after the release. When trading revenue fell during the first quarter from a year earlier, the bank had also blamed trading in currencies, commodities and corporate bonds.\par \par \uc2 Bank revenue from commodities broadly has been on a decline. Global revenue from commodities at the 12 biggest investment banks totaled $4.3 billion in the 2016 fiscal year, down from a peak of $14.5 billion in 2008, according to research and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Coalition Development Ltd., which measures trading and financing revenue.\par \par \uc2 Increased regulation has caused Wall Street banks to retreat in recent years from commodities, including activities in physical oil and gas.\par \par \uc2 An unexpected drop-off in oil prices this year has contributed to the malaise, after many banks and hedge funds had expected gains.\par \par \uc2 Veteran oil traders such as Pierre Andurand and Andrew Hall, both hedge-fund managers, lost money this year after betting that production cuts among members of the \uc2 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\uc2  would boost oil prices, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2 , energy's performance has lagged behind the returns in other commodities by the most in 27 years. The S&P GSCI Energy Total Return index lost 18.8% in 2017 through June 30, marking the sector's worst start to the year since 1998.\par \par \uc2 "Overall, the trading market is a little bit tricky right now," said Marc Fontaine, an independent consultant and former head of commodity derivatives for the Americas at \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2 . "There is a lot less volatility, and that makes it much more difficult not just for the \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 's of the world but the large merchants like Mercuria to trade and to trade well."\par \par \uc2 Returns from commodity-trading advisers, funds that trade futures including commodity contracts often based on market trends, have also suffered this year. \uc2 Soci\u233\'00\'E9t\u233\'00\'E9 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale\uc2 's SG CTA Index, which tracks performance of the funds, is down 3.45% this year through June, the worst first-half return since 2011. While CTAs trade futures in all asset classes, some in the sector attribute losses to a lack of major moves in commodities.\par \par \uc2 "You get a market where you're bullish at the top and bearish at the bottom. And those are tough markets to trade," said Tai Wong, head of metals trading at \uc2 BMO Capital Markets\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Among longer-term investors, the lackluster returns in oil and other commodities have damped enthusiasm. While typically volatile, net flows into commodities in the first half totaled $9.5 billion, an 86% drop from the first half of 2016 when net inflows totaled $69.8 billion, according to \uc2 RBC Capital Markets\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "As we see the oil price continue to decline...we definitely see a lot of negative sentiment in commodities," said Darwei Kung, portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion Deutsche Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund.\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds and other speculative investors have pared down their bullish bets on crude-oil futures after they reached a record high earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at \uc2 J.P. Morgan Asset Management\uc2 , said the drop in oil prices has prompted clients to focus more on holding commodities as an inflation hedge and a tool for diversification, rather than look for price gains.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Kemery also sees more opportunities in soft commodities and industrial metals, which may benefit from an improved macroeconomic outlook.\par \par \uc2 "What it has done is make our investors turn back to basics," she said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Stephanie Yang at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:stephanie.yang@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 stephanie.yang@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170719ed7j002e5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Macy's Inc. held its investor day June 6. A Business & Finance story Tuesday mistakenly asserted the event was held two weeks ago. \par \par \uc2 Toys "R" Us Inc\uc2 . will get a new website this summer as it struggles to compete online with its cash-rich rivals. The toy retailer, laden with $5 billion in debt, has spent $100 million over the past several years to help boost its online sales.\par \par \uc2 That won't stop the toy chain from falling further behind its rivals. \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 . {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-to-acquire-jet-com-for-3-3-billion-in-cash-stock-1470659763"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bought Jet.com last August for $3.3 billion  }}}\uc2 and since then has purchased three more online retailers. \uc2 Target Corp\uc2 . is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/target-sales-fall-as-traffic-and-average-orders-decline-1495020727"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 investing billions to lower prices }}}\uc2  and improve online sales.\par \par \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2  is one of many retailers fighting to keep up. High debt loads, increasingly nervous lenders and falling sales make it impossible to invest enough to compete online. And when companies do generate online sales, the margins are so tight that future investments are harder to make.\par \par \uc2 Macy's Inc\uc2 . had $5.5 billion in net debt at the end of the first quarter. A year ago, it said it would improve its performance and use the cash to pay down debt. Instead, the retailer struggled and had to use nearly two-thirds of its free cash flow last year to pay off $750 million in maturing debt. It bought back more this year, further hurting its ability to fund plans to revive sales, including improving its mobile app and expanding its off-price concept Backstage to more stores.\par \par \uc2 Worries that borrowing will become more expensive or won't be there at all have prompted some relatively healthy companies to focus on paying down their debt, which further limits the amount they can invest.\par \par \uc2 Retailers sold just four high-yield bonds this year worth $2.8 billion, compared with seven bonds worth $5.7 billion last year. That is down from a 20-year peak of 28 bonds totaling $10.7 billion in 2013, according to Dealogic. The amount of retail bank and bond debt rated by \uc2 Moody's\uc2  is up 65% since 2007.\par \par \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2  and other struggling chains can likely survive for years, but they will constantly struggle to catch up with the competition while still turning a profit. During holiday 2015, the toy retailer had to resort to "sales prevention" by halting some online deals after a deluge of web orders overwhelmed its ability to get products to customers in time for Christmas. The company had planned to launch its new website ahead of Christmas 2016 but was forced to delay it to fully test the new platform.\par \par \uc2 On a conference call with analysts June 15, Chief Executive \uc2 David Brandon\uc2  said a clunky online registry tool and the lack of a subscription feature for parents to receive regular shipments of diapers and other products were holding back \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2 's baby business.\par \par \uc2 "It's just one of a number of examples where we're limited in terms of how we can compete until we transition over to our new website," Mr. Brandon said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . sold an estimated $4 billion worth of toys last year, more than a third of what \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2  sells, according to \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm One Click Retail. Amazon's toy sales were up 24%, compared with 5% for the overall market and five years of declines for \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For big retail chains, one of the few levers left to pull are store closures. "We're in a period where we're going to see indefinite top-line and gross-margin declines until there have been enough store closures," said Jenna Giannelli, a retail credit analyst at Citigroup. Store closures will likely continue for the next five years or so as leases expire, she said.\par \par \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2 , which was taken private in 2005 in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2 , \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Vornado Realty Trust\uc2 , has swapped debt coming due this year and next for longer-term debt with a higher interest rate. Analysts expect it to do the same with another $400 million bond due next year, but that could be tough. On June 20, S&P Global Ratings lowered its outlook for the retailer, saying that if markets are nervous or the company's business gets worse, it might not be able to pay off that bond when it comes due.\par \par \uc2 Toys "R" Us\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Macy's\uc2  has been forced to rethink its strategy in other ways. In March 2015, Chief Financial Officer \uc2 Karen Hoguet\uc2  said the company "liked having control of our real estate." That November, \uc2 Macy's\uc2  announced it was exploring joint ventures for its four flagship properties. In 2016, it sold its men's store in San Francisco's Union Square, reached an agreement to sell its downtown Minneapolis store and began work on a plan to shrink its store on Chicago's \uc2 State Street\uc2  to make way for a buyer or joint-venture partner.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Macy's\uc2  laid out plans at its investor day June 6 for a revamped marketing strategy and greater focus on exclusive products, it warned that its 2017 gross-margin rate could be weaker than it had expected in February. The company cited excess inventory and bigger discounting in the beauty business. As recently as November 2016, \uc2 Macy's\uc2  was touting lower inventory levels.\par \par \uc2 Write to Miriam Gottfried at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://graphics.wsj.com/image-grid/closedStores-2017/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Did Your Favorite Store Close? }}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/07/17/it-might-be-time-to-add-blue-apron-to-the-death-by-amazon-index/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Blue Apron Shares Tumble Anew as Amazon's Shadow Looms }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170717ed7h00107\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Sizmek, an advertising technology company owned by private-equity firm \uc2 Vector Capital\uc2 , has agreed to acquire public ad-tech company \uc2 Rocket Fuel Inc\uc2 . for $125.5 million, or $2.60 per share, the companies said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Including assumption of debt, the deal values \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  at approximately $145 million.\par \par \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  shares closed at $2.69 Monday. The deal includes a 30-day "go-shop" period, in which \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  will solicit and potentially enter into alternative proposals from third parties.\par \par \uc2 "The board unanimously approved this transaction and we encourage our stockholders to follow that recommendation and tender their shares," \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  CEO \uc2 Randy Wootton\uc2  said in an email.\par \par \uc2 The deal price shows how \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2 , one of ad tech's high-profile players, has fallen from its lofty position a few years ago. The company's stock traded as high as $66 in its first month as a public company in 2013 and its market valuation peaked at around $2 billion.\par \par \uc2 Sizmek provides advertising buyers with tools to purchase digital ad space, optimize what their ads look like and manage their data for ad-targeting purposes. \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  also has data-management capabilities and offers a demand-side "predictive marketing" platform that it says uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to help marketers place their ads efficiently.\par \par \uc2 The two companies plan to combine their technology and scale in the hope of providing ad buyers with an alternative to \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 ., as well as other ad tech vendors. Together, they will serve more than 20,000 advertisers and 3,600 ad agencies, the companies said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The acquisition will mark the latest in a wave of consolidation for the ad tech sector, which has seen private-equity firms and companies in the media, cloud computing and telecommunications industries swoop in as buyers.\par \par \uc2 The majority of pure-play ad-tech firms have had a rough ride on the public markets, struggling to convince investors of their long-term potential, largely thanks to the dominance of \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  in the digital-advertising market. Combined, the two firms collect 77 cents of each new dollar spent on digital advertising in the U.S., according to research firm \uc2 eMarketer\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Excluding the sector's star performers, \uc2 Criteo\uc2  and \uc2 The Trade Desk\uc2 , ad-tech stocks were down an average of 7% in the three-month period ended June 6, 2017, according to data from investment bank \uc2 Luma Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the firm's share price began a precipitous decline in 2014. In May of that year, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/content/788d6d42-da6c-11e3-8273-00144feabdc0#axzz3HXN9M2tv"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Financial Times published a report}}}\uc2  alleging ads \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  bought on behalf of its client \uc2 Mercedes-Benz\uc2  had been viewed by more bots than humans.\par \par \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  denied the allegation, saying only 6% of the ads served were questionable.\par \par \uc2 The following year, the company announced layoffs and sweeping changes in its top management.\par \par \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2 's net loss, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, is expected to be between $4 million and $3 million in the second quarter of this year and full-year results "will be below current analysts' estimates," according to Mr. Wootton, who became CEO in November 2015.\par \par \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  posted a 1% decline in revenue last year to $456 million in 2016. It narrowed its net losses to $66 million, from $211 million in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Rocket Fuel\uc2  is trying to change from being a managed-service business that makes the majority of its revenue from taking a margin from clients' advertising spending, to becoming a technology-platform business that takes in regular software fees. Mr. Wootton said the pivot was taking longer than expected and the costs of being a public company made this process more challenging.\par \par \uc2 Sizmek, also previously a public company, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vector-capital-to-take-sizmek-private-1470231543"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 was acquired by}}}\uc2 Vector Capital\uc2  in an all-cash deal valuing the firm at $122 million including debt, in August, 2016.\par \par \uc2 "Vector has a broad vision for the digital advertising and marketing space, an appetite for funding the roll-up of great technology and the strategic approach to accelerate the creation of an independent, third-party" platform for ad buyers, said Sizmek Executive Chairman Mark Grether.\par \par \uc2 Write to Lara O'Reilly at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:lara.o'reilly@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 lara.o'reilly@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170718ed7i00209\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Security Technology, Says Famed Hacker\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jeff Stone \par \uc2 926 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 July 2017\par 12:24\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Cybersecurity\par \uc2 RSTPROCY\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 Internet security has come a long way since Peiter Zatko started calling himself "Mudge." That was Mr. Zatko's online identity two decades ago when he led the hacker think tank known as L0pht, which famously warned Congress about computer-security risks in 1999 and has since followed him into corporate America.\par \par \uc2 While the name "Mudge" has stuck Mr. Zatko and his L0pht cohorts have watched as the private sector became increasingly vulnerable to cybercrime and corporate espionage. Now, dogged not only by hacking threats such as phishing and ransomware, business leaders have learned how difficult it is to find qualified cybersecurity employees and to give those workers the means to protect as many systems as they can.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zatko--who spent time at the \uc2 U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\uc2  and \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . before he joined the payment technology company \uc2 Stripe Inc\uc2 . in May--is advocating \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  as one solution to data insecurity. He's an advisor to the board of directors at Versive Inc, an A.I. company building technology that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.versive.com/white_papers/next-generation-adversary-detection-artificial-intelligence-meets-mission-focused-threat-hunting/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 aims to bottle the skills}}}\uc2  of a top-tier researcher and use those tendencies as part of a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  program meant for IT teams at small- and medium-sized organizations.\par \par \uc2 When talking to small and medium-sized businesses frustrated with their current cybersecurity vendors, what's the first thing you tell them about \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zatko: First, I entirely sympathize because I've been on both ends and the vast majority of solutions out there cause more problems than they solve, to be most generous. When I went in as an outside consultant to improve security somewhere, it would take a lot of manual labor that I acquired over decades of being on both the offensive and defensive side.\par \par \uc2 What excited me about A.I. was that we could step back and look at the core things I was looking for. The \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and A.I. could also detect some of the subconscious things I would have been looking for, which is a fantastic marker, and tie it in together to say, \u8216\'20\'18What would someone like Mudge look like if he was doing this at scale and what was he doing subconsciously to look for adversaries?'\par \par \uc2 Maybe the technology is at a time and place that it can pull this off.\par \par \uc2 Generally, is that type of technique successful at identifying hackers lurking inside a business network?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zatko: Many organizations that do A.I. and security take a naive approach where they model networks and users and anything that's abnormal is inherently of interest. The problem is there's a tremendous amount of abnormal behavior that's actually innocuous and there's only a very thin line between what's tediously abnormal and what's abnormal for an adversary.\par \par \uc2 In reality what you're trying to do is find how adversaries find data, how they collect the data and how they move it out. There's normally tons of false-positives in each stage but very few false positives in all three. When that happens, that's where you can start to see what an adversary is doing.\par \par \uc2 How much does A.I. speed up the process of sifting through false-positives and finding actual bad guys?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zatko: With Versive I sat down early in the lifecycle with a set of data with the goal of just finding a few situations where I could say, \u8216\'20\'18This is a situation that scares the bejesus out of me and we'll be able to come up with a narrative for what I see,' which is the best way to get past false-positives. It took me at least a week of 9- or 10-hour days--and low and behold we had two true positives.\par \par \uc2 That was a relatively small amount of data compared to what they're looking at now, and by now they're doing all of that every night in just a few hours at a level that's a thousandfold more granular in detail.\par \par \uc2 How well-suited is the private sector to adopt this kind of technology? Will this help solve the employment shortage?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zatko: I think it does. I've run teams and I just don't have the staff or ability to train the people I need. I prefer this A.I. approach to a whole team of security folks who spend their time chasing false-positives and finding any number of intrusion attempts. What I really care about is the one successful entry.\par \par \uc2 In many cases small- and medium-sized businesses are in a better situation because their networks are a lot more manageable and they don't have decades of sprawl. One of the beautiful things about A.I. is that it's automated in going through all your systems. Say you have 5,000 systems or 500 systems, the network and the description and the number of ways to hide becomes smaller and smaller. The ability to collect all of the data on your structure--which has gotten easier with dropping cloud prices--it's actually cost-affordable now. A decade ago it would have been prohibitive.\par \par \uc2 (Jeff Stone writes exclusively for WSJ Pro Cybersecurity.

The underinsurance gap is even worse, finding just 7% of economic losses are covered.\par \par \uc2 Lloyd's estimates the cyberinsurance market to be worth $3 billion and $3.5 billion, with PwC estimating the market could hit $7.5 billion by 2020, stated the report.\par \par \uc2 "Despite this growth, insurers' understanding of cyber liability and risk aggregation is an evolving process as experience and knowledge of cyberattacks grows," stated the report. "Insureds' use of the internet is also changing, causing cyber risk accumulation to change rapidly over time in a way that other perils do not."\par \par \uc2 The report suggests risk managers should use the two cyberattack scenarios depicted to test the effects "on their core business processes, and plan what actions they could take to mitigate these risks."\par \par \uc2 George Ng, co-founder and chief technology officer at Cyence, said by making better use of the data in this report and from other sources insurers can get a better handle on the market and its risks and therefore offer better coverages that consumers need and want.\par \par \uc2 "If when I am writing the risk as a carrier and I am not really confident I can hedge by writing less risk," said Mr. Ng. "But if they can better understand what can happen they can provide more liquidity\u8230\'20\'26which can lead to a company getting the proper amount of insurance it needs. The better handle insurance companies can have on it the more willing they will be to supply that space."\par \par \uc2 Because companies have little or no control over hardware and software run by third-party providers, Mr. Ng said there is little they can do. "That's part of reason why we think insurance is such a key instrument there," he said, adding: "There are a lot of risks in world that aren't completely avoidable; in those cases they should look to transfer risk when they can't mitigate it."\par \par \uc2 (Ben DiPietro is an editor and reporter for Risk & Compliance Journal.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A rating firm in China is aiming to boost transparency in the country's often-murky world of corporate credit ratings.\par \par \uc2 Beijing-based \uc2 Dagong Global Credit Rating Co\uc2 . plans to launch a digital credit-rating platform in the coming months that requires companies to submit financial information daily.\par \par \uc2 "We need to limit the credit risks stemming from financial engineering and leveraging, especially among Chinese firms," said \uc2 Jianzhong Guan\uc2 , chairman of the agency. "Creditors and rating agencies often don't get access to crucial information."\par \par \uc2 The push for better reporting comes at a time of increasing competition from Western rivals to play a role in China's bond market, which was valued at $9.3 trillion at the end of last year. \uc2 China's central bank\uc2  said this month that foreign-owned rating firms would be allowed to assess credit risks in the interbank bond market if they register with the central bank and meet certain criteria.\par \par \uc2 Investors {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinpings-comments-spook-chinese-stock-markets-1500281053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 are also growing more nervous }}}\uc2  about some Chinese borrowers as Beijing cracks down on runaway debt. President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  over the weekend again stressed the importance of reining in high debt levels, sparking a drop in share prices.\par \par \uc2 Companies rated by Dagong will be able to enter sales and revenue data on a daily basis. An algorithm then calculates their creditworthiness and if necessary, makes changes to the rating. It focuses on a company's profitability, its debt-reduction capability and the nature of its assets, Mr. Guan said.\par \par \uc2 "Tools like this could boost the credibility of Chinese credit-ratings firms," said Oliver Rui, a professor for finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. Currently, there is no local rating agency that asks companies to submit data on a daily basis, he said.\par \par \uc2 In fact, few raters globally do anything similar, although Business Funding Research Ltd., a U.K. firm, takes data submitted in filings and adjusts risk ratings within 24 hours if warranted.\par \par \uc2 Some Western competitors express doubts about the self-reporting. "I don't know whether a company would provide financial information on a daily basis," said Gary Lau, managing director at Moody's Investors Service Hong Kong Ltd.\par \par \uc2 Moody's\uc2  doesn't use an algorithm-based system, he said, adding, "We monitor rated entities on an ongoing basis."\par \par \uc2 However, Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc., a separate unit, has since 2010 used models that can calculate ratings and default probabilities for Chinese companies, said David Hamilton, managing director for Asia Pacific Stress Testing and Credit Risk \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The company uses both company financial data and market data, such as changes in equity value, in its models. The \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group doesn't have access to information that issuers share with the ratings agency, he said.\par \par \uc2 For Dagong, besides defending its home turf, it is also looking to challenge the industry's leaders outside China. It has offices in Milan and Frankfurt, and is looking to add more locations, although it doesn't currently have plans to set up in London because of concerns about Britain's planned exit from the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , Mr. Guan said.\par \par \uc2 He sees Chinese credit-ratings firms serving as a counterweight to \uc2 Fitch Ratings Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 S&P Global Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Moody's\uc2 . "After the crisis, the three Western credit-rating organizations dramatically downgraded the ratings of over two-thirds of their clients," he said. "It proved that their rating method was wrong."\par \par \uc2 Western agencies point to changes they have made since the 2008 financial crisis. "The notion that nothing has changed in this industry is pure fiction," a spokesman for \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  said. The company said it doesn't apply ratings using algorithms.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for S&P Global said the firm in recent years has improved its ratings methodology.\par \par \uc2 Like its competitors, Dagong is paid by the issuer of a bond. After the financial crisis, critics of ratings firms decried the practice, saying it can cause a conflict of interest. "We don't see this as a good solution, but it is required by the regulator," Mr. Guan said.\par \par \uc2 Still, he is relying on the firms to provide accurate information\u8212\'20\'14a potential risk in a country such as China, where transparency is low and investors struggle to verify financial information provided by companies. "This is a huge issue in China," said Mr. Rui, at the China Europe International Business School.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Guan said he trusts the information entered into the database will be correct, reasoning that the firms are mostly listed entities that he argues can't afford to provide false information.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rui said he thinks more needs to be done to improve the quality of Chinese credit ratings. "They [the Chinese agencies] tend to be over-optimistic about the firms they rate," he said.\par \par \uc2 Dagong's Mr. Guan rejects the criticism. "If we discover sensitive issues or find a company incapable of repaying its debt, we will keep a very close eye on it," he said.\par \par \uc2 The agency's daily credit updates could help flag whether a company is in danger of defaulting on its bonds, said Mr. Guan. At the end of March, domestic bonds from Chinese companies totaling 4.04 trillion yuan ($595.5 billion) were up for repayment within 12 months, according to Wind Info, a data provider.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, defaults by Chinese companies have risen, as the government no longer prevents all of them. "They are allowing selective defaults, as long as a company does not pose a systemic risk," said Mr. Lau of \uc2 Moody's\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170717ed7h002p9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

This has prompted several fund companies - including \uc2 Woodford Investment Management\uc2 , M&G and Jupiter - to decide it is simpler and more appealing for investors if they cover the cost of research themselves.\par \par \uc2 Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes, which oversees \u163\'00\'A330bn of assets, said: "We think it is the right thing to do in terms of the end beneficiary. And when we looked at the cost of [alternative] arrangements [whereby research costs are passed on to clients] and the amount of compliance you have to put in around those, the difference in budget was not huge."\par \par \uc2 Previously fund companies tended to receive research from banks and brokerages for free, although the cost of this service was built into trading prices. Under the new regime, which is intended to stamp out conflicts of interest and reduce costs for investors, the banks and brokerages will need to set out exactly how much they think their research is worth. This has prompted a period of fierce negotiations between asset managers and analysts over research prices since the start of the year.\par \par \uc2 Mr Murray said Hermes has held meetings with three-quarters of the 60 research providers it uses since the start of the year to discuss prices. "Some figures are eye-raisingly high, and others are most realistic," he said. He added that any bank hoping to charge hundreds of thousands of pounds for annual access to their research is unlikely to win Hermes' business.\par \par \uc2 "Our sense is that over the next five months, those numbers will come down. We will end up with a large handful of big providers who cover everything, and then have a more selective group of providers focused on specific areas. We will be quite choosy," he said.\par \par \uc2 Other asset managers, including Amundi, Janus Henderson, \uc2 Schroders\uc2  and \uc2 Man Group\uc2 , plan to continue to pass this cost on to their clients.\par \par \uc2 Many large fund houses are also expected to cull the number of external research providers they use in an effort to control costs. Amundi, Europe's largest-listed asset manager, has already halved the number of research houses it uses, while Union Asset Management, Germany's third-largest fund manager, said it June it was poised to cull 100 research providers.\par \par \uc2 Mr Murray said the new rules would be "hugely transformative" for the industry. "My sense is that there will be a reduction in the use of traditional sellside research, and almost certainly [asset managers will make] more use of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data science. The nature of research consumption will change dramatically."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170717ed7h00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Charles Scharf\uc2  is returning to Wall Street as the new chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon Corp., placing a retail banking veteran in charge of a firm that safeguards trillions of dollars for big institutions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scharf, 52 years old, replaced \uc2 Gerald Hassell\uc2  as CEO Monday. The 65-year-old Mr. Hassell will remain chairman at BNY Mellon until Dec. 31, when he will hand the title to Mr. Scharf.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scharf's challenge will be to jump-start growth and navigate the technological changes sweeping through the financial-services industry. The New York company responded to pressure earlier this decade from shareholders, including activist \uc2 Trian Fund Management LP\uc2 , to cut costs during a period of low interest rates. Profits have improved, but revenue growth remains tepid.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hassell planned to retire once the firm showed progress on a series of goals set in 2014, according to the BNY Mellon CEO and Ed Garden, Trian's chief investment officer and a BNY Mellon director. Trian didn't push for a change in leadership, Mr. Hassell said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 "I have enjoyed a highly collaborative and constructive relationship with Gerald and am excited to welcome Charlie to BNY Mellon," Mr. Garden said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 BNY Mellon's shares rose 1.9% and closed at $53.35 on Monday. They have climbed 32% in the past year, underperforming the benchmark KBW Bank Index's 43% gain.\par \par \uc2 The appointment gives Mr. Scharf a second chance at running a public company. He {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-ceo-charles-scharf-is-stepping-down-1476735288"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 left the top post }}}\uc2 at San Francisco payments network \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 . in 2016 so he could be closer to his family in New York.\par \par \uc2 Before heading to \uc2 Visa\uc2  in 2012, Mr. Scharf worked in the banking industry, including a seven-year stint running the enormous retail-banking division of \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A top lieutenant to J.P. Morgan Chief Executive \uc2 James Dimon\uc2  for roughly two decades, Mr. Scharf was at one time considered a potential successor. He left \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scharf had been eager to return to his roots at a large financial firm, people familiar with the matter said. On Monday he said in an interview that he weighed options inside and outside the financial-services industry before concluding BNY Mellon "was one of the most exciting places to be" given the company's central role in the world's financial system.\par \par \uc2 The bank now has more than {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bny-mellon-assets-fall-hurt-by-outflows-and-strong-dollar-1484829559"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $30 trillion in assets}}}\uc2  under custody, and runs a collection of investment managers that oversee a combined $1.7 trillion.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hassell spent his entire career at BNY Mellon. He was named CEO in 2011 when the company was still coming to terms with the lasting effects of a financial downturn. Low interest rates crimped its profits, and the bank's margins lagged behind those of rivals \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Northern Trust Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He also had to wrestle with demands made by Trian, which purchased a stake in June 2014 and sought cost cuts. In October 2014, BNY Mellon unveiled plans to shed $500 million in expenses through 2017. That December, the company added Trian's Mr. Garden {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-new-york-mellon-gives-activist-trian-fund-a-board-seat-1417524537"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 to its board.}}}\par \par \uc2 The cuts and investments in technology helped lift profits even as revenue growth languished below some of BNY Mellon's biggest peers, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said. In 2016, the bank reached many of its targets Mr. Hassell set in 2014, including those on its return on equity and operating margin.\par \par \uc2 Yet competition in the firm's core custody business has made it more difficult for BNY Mellon and its rivals to charge higher fees.\par \par \uc2 "Their business size and client mix has shown limited growth," Mr. Schorr said. "I'm not sure Charlie or anyone else in the world can impact that."\par \par \uc2 BNY Mellon, like its rivals, plans to develop \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other tools that harness the reams of data produced by its custody business. The company may also look to expand its markets business beyond its main currency-trading arm.\par \par \uc2 "Because of digitization, there are more opportunities to do things for clients if you have the right kind of structure," Mr. Scharf said.\par \par \uc2 Conversations about who would succeed him "have been under way for several years," Mr. Hassell said. The outgoing CEO turns 66 this year.\par \par \uc2 The company retained \uc2 Korn/Ferry International\uc2  to lead the search, and weighed several internal and external candidates. Several shareholders, though, expected BNY Mellon to choose an outsider.\par \par \uc2 Korn/Ferry\uc2  reached out to Mr. Scharf late last year, and eventually introduced him to the board, a BNY Mellon spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 "Charlie became not only available, but the best person for the job," Mr. Hassell said.\par \par \uc2 In a memo to employees Monday, Mr. Scharf said "I know change is never easy, but I will do my best to make it smooth."\par \par \uc2 Emily Glazer contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Justin Baer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:justin.baer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 justin.baer@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Read More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/06/07/bny-mellon-chief-information-officer-suresh-kumar-is-leaving-company/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 BNY Mellon Chief Information Officer Suresh Kumar Is Leaving Company }}}\uc2 (June 7)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bny-government-securities-unit-formed-to-settle-treasury-trades-1496234700"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 BNY Government Securities Unit Formed to Settle Treasury Trades }}}\uc2 (March 31)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bny-mellon-assets-fall-hurt-by-outflows-and-strong-dollar-1484829559"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 BNY Mellon Cost Cuts Help Lift Profit }}}\uc2 (Jan. 19)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-ceo-charles-scharf-is-stepping-down-1476735288"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Visa CEO Charles Scharf Is Stepping Down }}}\uc2 (Oct 17, 2016)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170717ed7h001me\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Hermes Investment Management\uc2  has followed the lead of star UK fund manager \uc2 Neil Woodford\uc2  and rival asset manager Jupiter by deciding to stop passing the cost of external analyst research on to its clients.\par \par \uc2 The London-based fund manager, which is owned by the pension scheme for UK telecoms group BT, plans to cover the cost of research itself ahead of the introduction of sweeping European rules in 2018 that will transform how investors pay for analyst research.\par \par \uc2 The rules, which fall under Europe\u8217\'20\'19s Mifid II directive, will force asset managers to present a clear budget for research to clients for the first time. This has prompted several fund companies \u8212\'20\'14 including \uc2 Woodford Investment Management\uc2 , M&G and Jupiter \u8212\'20\'14 to decide it is simpler and more appealing for investors if they cover the cost of research themselves.\par \par \uc2 Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes, which oversees \u163\'00\'A330bn of assets, said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe think it is the right thing to do in terms of the end beneficiary. And when we looked at the cost of [alternative] arrangements [whereby research costs are passed on to clients] and the amount of compliance you have to put in around those, the difference in budget was not huge.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Previously fund companies tended to receive research from banks and brokerages for free, although the cost of this service was built into trading prices. Under the new regime, which is intended to stamp out conflicts of interest and reduce costs for investors, the banks and brokerages will need to set out exactly how much they think their research is worth. This has prompted a period of fierce negotiations between asset managers and analysts over research prices since the start of the year.\par \par \uc2 Mr Murray said Hermes has held meetings with three-quarters of the 60 research providers it uses since the start of the year to discuss prices. \u8220\'20\'1CSome figures are eye-raisingly high, and others are most realistic,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. He added that any bank hoping to charge hundreds of thousands of pounds for annual access to their research is unlikely to win Hermes\u8217\'20\'19 business.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur sense is that over the next five months, those numbers will come down. We will end up with a large handful of big providers who cover everything, and then have a more selective group of providers focused on specific areas. We will be quite choosy,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Other asset managers, including Amundi, Janus Henderson, \uc2 Schroders\uc2  and \uc2 Man Group\uc2 , plan to continue to pass this cost on to their clients.\par \par \uc2 Many large fund houses are also expected to cull the number of external research providers they use in an effort to control costs. Amundi, Europe\u8217\'20\'19s largest-listed asset manager, has already halved the number of research houses it uses, while Union Asset Management, Germany\u8217\'20\'19s third-largest fund manager, said it June it was poised to cull 100 research providers.\par \par \uc2 Mr Murray said the new rules would be \u8220\'20\'1Chugely transformative\u8221\'20\'1D for the investment industry. \u8220\'20\'1CMy sense is that there will be a reduction in the use of traditional sellside research, and almost certainly [asset managers will make] more use of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data science. The nature of research consumption will change dramatically.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170716ed7g000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Shares in the owner of the Snapchat messaging service plunged through their $17 initial public offering price on Tuesday to below $16.\par \par \uc2 To the sceptical observer, it was all but inevitable that Snap 's share price would fall from its peak of $27, hit just days after its March float. The company has never made a profit. Its IPO prospectus warned of slowing user growth as well as stronger competition for advertising from well-funded rivals, notably \uc2 Instagram\uc2 's stories feature.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the stock has been a magnet for investors who bet that its price will fall: the short interest is equal to 28 per cent of the company's free float. And that is after short sellers made profits of up to $396m in just under six weeks in June and July, according to estimates of S3 Partners, a financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group.\par \par \uc2 This week's sell-off was prompted in part by a change of heart at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , the investment bank that led Snap's IPO. Analysts there had gushed in March about the company's potential to monetise its engaged, young audience through advertising. This week, they slashed their target share price from $28 to $16, writing "we have been wrong about Snap's ability to innovate and improve its ad product this year." Analysts at Citi, which also participated in the float, rated Snap a buy until mid-June, well after the company's first, disappointing results as a public company.\par \par \uc2 S&P Capital IQ\uc2 , which tracks Snap research from 30 analysts, calculates the average rating on Snap is still "Buy", with a price target of $20. One analyst continues to predict that the shares will rise to $31.\par \par \uc2 Some tech groups do pull themselves into profit after post-listing teething problems. While \uc2 Facebook\uc2  leads that list, there are plenty of counter-examples. \uc2 GoPro\uc2  shares are down by three-quarters since their first day of trading in 2014. \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's share price has dropped by almost 60 per cent since its 2013 IPO.\par \par \uc2 But the early hype and continuing enthusiasm in some quarters for Snap reignites longstanding questions about sellside analyst research. Many - but not all - analysts seem to have misfired on the most basic questions: how unique is this company's product, how will it make money and how does that translate into a share price?\par \par \uc2 The question is why. The cynics will remember the dotcom era when 12 Wall Street banks paid more than $1.5bn to settle allegations that they had slanted their research to favour investment banking clients. Though the banks claimed to have learnt their lesson back then, incidents keep cropping up.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, US regulators fined 10 banks that "offered favourable research coverage" to gain work on an IPO. This week, the French markets regulator disciplined \uc2 Soci\u233\'00\'E9t\u233\'00\'E9 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale\uc2  for failing to disclose how it arrived at a price target, and disclose that the bank had previously worked on an IPO. Then again, sometimes bank analysts simply get it wrong.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the reasons, new European rules may finally tip the balance in favour of no-holds-barred research. Starting in January, fund companies must tell investors how much they are paying for research, rather than bundling with other costs. That means they will expect to get value for their money. Overly sympathetic analysis is unlikely to survive the inevitable cull. Reality is catching up with investment banking research, too.\par \par \uc2 brooke.masters@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170715ed7f0002d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

In 2015, Waterland took just three months to raise \u8364\'20\'AC1.55 billion across two different vehicles. The average buyout fundraising took just over 16 months that year, according to data provider Preqin Ltd.\par \par \uc2 Waterland is the latest European buyout firm seeking to take advantage of surging appetite for the asset class.\par \par \uc2 Buyout firms are raising money at a pace not seen since before the financial crisis. European firms gathered $61.9 billion of investor commitments in the first six months of the year, a 12% increase from the first six months of 2016 and the highest half-year total since 2008.\par \par \uc2 Top-performing funds, including \uc2 CVC Capital Partners\uc2 , which according to investors was oversubscribed for its \u8364\'20\'AC16 billion flagship fund; and \uc2 Vitruvian Partners\uc2 , which raised a fund double the size of its predecessor after just six weeks in the market, have been able to raise capital seemingly at will.\par \par \uc2 There are few firms with a better track record than Waterland. Private-equity \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Peracs GmbH named it the top-performing private-equity firm globally in its 2016 ranking Peracs rates firms by factors including their internal rates of return and distributions to investors.\par \par \uc2 The Dutch buy-and-build specialist knocked U.S. tech investor \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2  off the top spot after managing successive top-quartile performing funds.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, Vista also closed its largest-ever flagship fund when it smashed through its $10 billion hard cap to collect $11 billion, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.\par \par \uc2 Waterland was founded by Dutch entrepreneur Rob Thielen in 1999 to buy controlling stakes in mid-market Dutch companies.\par \par \uc2 Since then, it has slowly grown its investment strategy across Europe, opening offices in Germany, Poland, Belgium and, most recently, in the U.K.\par \par \uc2 The firm set up an office in Manchester in January to target platform deals in U.K. lower mid-market companies with a view to expanding them across Europe.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jessica Davies at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jessica.davies@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jessica.davies@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and William Louch at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:william.louch@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 william.louch@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20170714ed7e000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  is an unlikely Goldilocks, but the Federal Reserve chairwoman has finally chased the three bears away from emerging markets. The jump in emerging-market stocks and currencies after her slightly dovish comments on Wednesday means that after almost 10 years, investors who put $1,000 into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index at the 2007 peak now have $1,000 again, before fees and taxes, assuming they reinvested their dividends.\par \par \uc2 There are lessons here about central banks, emerging markets and, unexpectedly, technology stocks.\par \par \uc2 The first is that markets are particularly prone to overinterpret central-bank comments, as investors worry that almost a decade of easy money is coming to an end.\par \par \uc2 Comments by Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney and European Central Bank chief \uc2 Mario Draghi\uc2  in Sintra, Portugal, two weeks ago turned into a Sintra conspiracy theory of coordinated global tightening, helped along by the \uc2 Bank of Canada\uc2  and others. The market priced in higher interest rates even as inflation expectations fell.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen's testimony to Congress on Wednesday suggested investors had made a mistake. Sure, the \uc2 Bank of Canada\uc2  had indeed turned hawkish, raising rates for the first time in seven years, but Ms. Yellen made clear the Fed would change course if recent weak inflation persists. If there is a global conspiracy for tighter money even in the absence of inflation, the Fed isn't part of it.\par \par \uc2 The second lesson is that this matters for emerging markets. Many investors have been arguing that there will be no repeat of the 2013 "taper tantrum" that hit emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies when the Fed signaled it would soon end its stimulus.\par \par \uc2 The thinking is that emerging-market countries are better prepared this time. But if their currencies, bond prices and stocks rise when Ms. Yellen is a little bit dovish, that strongly suggests they will fall if she turns hawkish.\par \par \uc2 A fall doesn't equate to a tantrum, but sensitivity is high. On Wednesday, Ms. Yellen's comments prompted a 0.04 percentage-point drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, and a rise of about 1% in emerging-market local-currency bond prices, in dollar terms.\par \par \uc2 If the link between the two stays the same and Treasury yields rise as they did in 2013, emerging-market bonds could repeat the 20%-plus drop of 2013.\par \par \uc2 The third lesson is that the performance of tech stocks depends in part on the Fed, and in turn, is vital to emerging-market investors.\par \par \uc2 Stories justifying tech companies are about disruption -- of media, retail, cars, or in the case of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , everything. But the Fed also matters, because tech firms are high-growth companies that ought to be able to increase profits even if the economy does little.\par \par \uc2 Profits far in the future are worth more when interest rates are low, so tech stocks are more sensitive to rates than others.\par \par \uc2 Equally, a weak economy -- one cause of low rates -- leaves a dearth of rapidly growing companies, making tech stocks one of relatively few options for investors who want to chase growth. Bring back growth, and there is less need to pay up to hold expensive tech stocks.\par \par \uc2 Tech stocks have performed wonderfully so far this year, with the sector leading the S&P 500, as hopes for a U.S. stimulus faded. The same was true Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Tech, in turn, matters to emerging markets, because the vision many have of these countries as poverty-stricken and backward isn't accurate -- at least as far as their main stock-market index goes.\par \par \uc2 Technology is now the biggest sector in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and five tech companies alone make up 17% of its value.\par \par \uc2 Three of those -- South Korea's \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 , \uc2 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\uc2  and Taiwan's \uc2 Hon Hai Precision\uc2  Industries -- are in countries richer per capita than Italy, adjusted for purchasing-power parity.\par \par \uc2 Four of the five big emerging-market tech companies are up more than 46% in dollar terms this year, with Alibaba, China's answer to \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2 , up 70% through Wednesday. Even laggard Taiwan Semi is up 23%. All suffer the same sensitivity to the economy and interest rates as America's tech giants, as they demonstrated after the U.S. election briefly brought rising bond yields and hopes of economic stimulus.\par \par \uc2 Investors even in such apparently diverse areas as technology and emerging markets have little choice but to be Fed watchers. Emerging-market shareholders can reasonably hope that the next decade is more rewarding than the last, but they shouldn't rely on the Fed keeping the bears at bay.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw380\pich554\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal5700\pichgoal8310

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc71}{\*\bkmkend toc71}\b \uc2 Streetwise: Emerging Markets, Technology and Yellen\b0\par\par\uc2 By James Mackintosh \par \uc2 785 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 July 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)\par \uc2 WSJE\par B1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  is an unlikely Goldilocks, but the Federal Reserve chairwoman has finally chased the three bears away from emerging markets. The jump in emerging-market stocks and currencies after her slightly dovish comments on Wednesday means that after almost 10 years, investors who put $1,000 into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index at the 2007 peak now have $1,000 again, before fees and taxes, assuming they reinvested their dividends.\par \par \uc2 There are lessons here about central banks, emerging markets and, unexpectedly, technology stocks.\par \par \uc2 The first is that markets are particularly prone to overinterpret central-bank comments, as investors worry that almost a decade of easy money is coming to an end.\par \par \uc2 Comments by Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney and European Central Bank chief \uc2 Mario Draghi\uc2  in Sintra, Portugal, two weeks ago turned into a Sintra conspiracy theory of coordinated global tightening, helped along by the \uc2 Bank of Canada\uc2  and others. The market priced in higher interest rates even as inflation expectations fell.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen's testimony to Congress on Wednesday suggested investors had made a mistake. Sure, the \uc2 Bank of Canada\uc2  had indeed turned hawkish, raising rates for the first time in seven years, but Ms. Yellen made clear the Fed would change course if recent weak inflation persists. If there is a global conspiracy for tighter money even in the absence of inflation, the Fed isn't part of it.\par \par \uc2 The second lesson is that this matters for emerging markets. Many investors have been arguing that there will be no repeat of the 2013 "taper tantrum" that hit emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies when the Fed signaled it would soon end its stimulus. The thinking is emerging-market countries are better prepared this time. But if their currencies, bond prices and stocks rise when Ms. Yellen is a little bit dovish, that strongly suggests they will fall if she turns hawkish.\par \par \uc2 A fall doesn't equate to a tantrum, but sensitivity is high. On Wednesday, Ms. Yellen's comments prompted a 0.04% drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, and a rise of about 1% in emerging-market local-currency bond prices, in dollar terms. If the link between the two stayed the same, and Treasury yields rose as they did in 2013, emerging-market bonds could repeat the 20%-plus drop of 2013.\par \par \uc2 The third lesson is that the performance of tech stocks depends in part on the Fed, and in turn, is vital to emerging-market investors.\par \par \uc2 Stories justifying tech companies are about disruption -- of media, retail, cars, or in the case of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , everything. But the Fed also matters, because tech firms are high-growth companies that ought to be able to increase profits even if the economy does little.\par \par \uc2 Profits far in the future are worth more when interest rates are low, so tech stocks are more sensitive to rates than others. Equally, a weak economy -- one cause of low rates -- leaves a dearth of fast-growing companies, making tech stocks one of relatively few options for investors who want to chase growth. Bring back growth, and there is less need to pay up to hold expensive tech stocks.\par \par \uc2 Tech stocks have performed wonderfully so far this year, with the sector leading the S&P 500, as hopes for a U.S. stimulus faded. The same was true Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Tech, in turn, matters to emerging markets, because the vision many have of these countries as poverty-stricken and backward isn't accurate -- at least as far as their main stock-market index goes.\par \par \uc2 Technology is now the biggest sector in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and five tech companies alone make up 17% of its value. Three of those -- South Korea's \uc2 Samsung Electronics\uc2 , \uc2 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\uc2  and Taiwan's \uc2 Hon Hai Precision\uc2  Industries -- are in countries richer per capita than Italy, adjusted for purchasing-power parity.\par \par \uc2 Four of the five big emerging-market tech companies are up more than 46% in dollar terms this year, with Alibaba, China's answer to \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2 , up 70% through Wednesday. Even laggard Taiwan Semi is up 23%. All suffer the same sensitivity to the economy and interest rates as America's tech giants, as they demonstrated after the U.S. election briefly brought rising bond yields and hopes of economic stimulus.\par \par \uc2 Investors even in such apparently diverse areas as technology and emerging markets have little choice but to be Fed watchers. Emerging-market shareholders can reasonably hope that the next decade is more rewarding than the last, but they shouldn't rely on the Fed keeping the bears at bay.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WECO20170714000060"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020170714ed7e0001m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

It advised investors to be "overweight" on the LA-based start-up, giving it a glowing price target of $28, far above its IPO price of $17 at the start of the month.\par \par \uc2 But this week, \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  declared it had been "wrong" about Snap's ability to innovate and improve its advertising product. User growth was weaker than it expected and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , the \uc2 Facebook\uc2 -owned photo app, was about to eat its lunch. The bank downgraded it to equal weight and gave it a price target below the IPO price: $16.\par \par \uc2 "The IPO was incredibly hyped-up, and it hasn't traded well," said one senior IPO banker who did not work on the deal. "The analysts are just trying to cover themselves now because it's done so poorly."\par \par \uc2 Shares in Snap have tumbled 38 per cent from their closing price on the first day of trading, falling to $15.24 yesterday. Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group, said short sellers made profits of up to $396m in just under six weeks in June and July.\par \par \uc2 But some expect it to fall further, with the current short interest about a quarter of the shares outstanding. "Short sellers have high conviction in their trade," said Mr Dusaniwsky, citing the 60 per cent and higher stock borrow fees they are paying.\par \par \uc2 Two crunch points are coming. The market could be flooded with more stock at the end of July, when a 150-day lock-up is due to expire, and the end of August, when the 180-day lock-up ends. Analysts at Citi, which also participated in the underwriting and downgraded Snap in June, believe the Snap float will increase by more than 500 per cent - though many may choose to hang on to those shares. Snap did not respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 "It is still massively overvalued at current levels," said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, who has always had a "sell" rating on Snap. "I'm an optimist on the company and I can't get to better than a $9 price target."\par \par \uc2 Mr Wieser was one of many analysts who warned after the IPO that, rather than being the next \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Snap faced increased competition from \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , which is combining a copycat of Snapchat's stories feature with \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's systems for targeting and measuring ad effectiveness. \uc2 Instagram\uc2  Stories has 250m daily active users to Snapchat's 166m, and overall \uc2 Instagram\uc2  has more than 700m monthly active users.\par \par \uc2 "Snap is a niche product. It is never going to be ubiquitous. This reminds me of all the conversations we had about \uc2 Twitter\uc2  four years ago," he said.\par \par \uc2 Shares in \uc2 Twitter\uc2  also dived within months of its IPO, amid concerns that user growth was slowing. It has since struggled to take share in a digital ad market where marketers are attracted to \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2 's immense scale.\par \par \uc2 Scott Galloway\uc2 , professor of marketing at the NYU Stern School of Business, said Snap is the "most overvalued company".\par \par \uc2 "It is being crushed by a competitor with more engineers, more capital and more management," he said. "People were hoping that Snap would be the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  of video, but the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  of video is \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , specifically \uc2 Instagram\uc2  Stories."\par \par \uc2 One of \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's prime concerns was that Snap had not yet convinced advertisers of its return on investment, with many not pushing beyond experimental budgets on the platform. Users can tap fast to get rid of the video ads, lowering completion rates, which so far are the easiest way to judge the performance of an ad.\par \par \uc2 But Snap is already working to solve some of these problems.\par \par \uc2 It bought Placed, a company which uses location data to measure in-store visits. It could help it prove that ads lead to sales and recently launched a self-service tool.\par \par \uc2 Cathy Boyle, an analyst at research firm \uc2 eMarketer\uc2 , said marketers had been concerned Snap's ads were too pricey, but she expected the recent launch of a self-service tool would make it cheaper. She also believed Snap could benefit from advertiser interest in developing a third platform .\par \par \uc2 "Advertisers are looking to spread budgets around and not be so invested in \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 ," she said.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of 360i, a digital marketing agency, said Snap's problems are not new, even reminding her of the early days of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's advertising business. She said Snap could grow by learning from those companies, adding: "The concerns surrounding Snapchat are very reminiscent of what we saw with \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  over the past few years."\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Robin Wigglesworth\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170713ed7d00028\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The advent of autonomous vehicles has fuelled a rush by carmakers and venture firms to invest in transport technologies.\par \par \uc2 With a growing number of specialised venture funds dedicating themselves to auto tech - a field that spans everything from \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and mapping, to logistics and parking services - their approaches are starting to diverge. One camp of investors is focused on transport services viable in the near-term, while the other is betting on a utopian vision of fully self-driving vehicles.\par \par \uc2 AutoTech, a new Silicon Valley venture firm, is in the first camp and announced the close of its first fund of $120m yesterday.\par \par \uc2 Alexei Andreev\uc2  and Quin Garcia , its co-founders, say they are looking for start-ups that can help alleviate today's transport problems, such as parking, leasing, insurance and car repair.\par \par \uc2 "We have to think about how to make money in the next 10 years, and in our view, full Level Five autonomous vehicles and flying cars is more than that 10-year horizon," Mr Garcia said, referring to cars that can completely drive themselves. "We don't want to invest in a company whose success is predicated on full adoption of autonomous."\par \par \uc2 "We probably gravitate more toward the realist end of the spectrum, rather than the mega-moon shot end of the spectrum," he added.\par \par \uc2 Investors in the AutoTech fund include industry stalwarts such as Borg Warner, the auto components manufacturer, as well as car dealership, trucking and car repair groups, the company said. Japanese carmaker \uc2 Nissan\uc2  was also an investor, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile the \uc2 Toyota Research Institute\uc2  launched a $100m \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  fund on Tuesday, called Toyota AI Ventures. This will invest in early-stage start-ups working on technologies relevant to autonomous driving and robotics. The funding is part of an initial $1bn commitment from Toyota.\par \par \uc2 Power efficiency, automotive grade sensors, training simulations and automatic data-labelling were challenging, said Gill Pratt, head of TRI. "We have particular technical problems that we think it would be great for someone to solve," said Mr Pratt. "The whole reason we are setting up this fund is because we don't think we can do it ourselves."\par \par \uc2 Some in the Valley fear that the autonomous driving sector has become an overhyped " gold rush ." Global investment in autotech start-ups in the first half was double last year's total of $790m for the same period, CB Insights said. Deal volume also hit a record high, with 35 investments made during the second quarter, according to its data.\par \par \uc2 "The world is awash in cash, and venture cash in particular," acknowledged Mr Pratt. "But it is not awash in companies that make 10m cars a year," he said, referring to Toyota, "so I hope that our money can be a smarter choice for some of the start-ups."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170713ed7d0001q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Reckitt-Benckiser and Mondelez warned last week that the cyber attack had hit sales at the consumer goods companies.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Horing\uc2 , managing director at Insight Venture Partners, said it had invested in \uc2 Darktrace\uc2  because it had grown into a \u8220\'20\'1Cworld leader\u8221\'20\'1D in security powered by \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170711ed7b004bn\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It is also being used by local governments to discourage behaviors like jaywalking. In park near Shanghai, for example, it is being used to identify race participants who take shortcuts on a running track.\par \par \uc2 But commercial uses are growing, as the technology emerges as an alternative way to identify people who are gaining access to workplaces, boarding airplanes, making ATM withdrawals and checking into hotels.\par \par \uc2 American tech companies are active in the sector as well. \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . is considered a pioneer in the field and last year \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . bought Emotient, a startup whose technology assesses emotions based on facial expressions. Los Angeles-based FaceFirst Inc. provides facial recognition systems for U.S. and international airports and military bases.\par \par \uc2 SenseTime, which also provides facial and image recognition to the finance and mobile internet sectors, was founded in 2014 and has 500 employees. Local Chinese governments are among its biggest clients.\par \par \uc2 The company will use the funding raised to retain and hire talent and pay for research into other technologies that rely on \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , including self-driving cars and medical diagnostics, said Chief Executive Xu Li.\par \par \uc2 SenseTime investors include Chinese private-equity fund CDH Investments and Sailing Capital, a VC fund linked to the Shanghai government.\par \par \uc2 "We are already seeing the early signs of how \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  is changing traditional industry," CDH Investments Chairman Wu Shangzhi said. "The time has come for AI to have a big impact.''\par \par \uc2 In total, AI-focused tech startups in China raised $500 million in the first six months of the year, preliminary data from Dow Jones VentureSource showed, compared with $700 million for all of last year. No separate data was available for facial recognition startups.\par \par \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 . Chairman Jack Ma and \uc2 Foxconn Technology Co\uc2 . are investors in these kinds of startups. Yunfeng Capital, a venture fund founded by Mr. Ma, is an investor in Shanghai-based Yitu Technology. Foxconn has a stake in Beijing-based Megvii Technology Ltd.\par \par \uc2 Providing smart surveillance systems for national security gave startups a huge leg up when they began, said Cool Zhang, IDC China's director for \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . China's annual public-security budget is huge, making it an easy sector for companies to generate revenue, he said.\par \par \uc2 Privacy advocates worry that the technology could be used by governments to conduct random surveillance without cause.\par \par \uc2 "This is a force multiplier that takes the identification of people in public to a completely different level," said Clare Garvie, a researcher for the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say investment in the sector is expected to continuing growing\u8212\'20\'14especially in China, where the government has made a big push to advance AI technologies. The promotional material that SenseTime provides to potential investors includes photos of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang testing out its facial recognition technology at the State Council building in Beijing.\par \par \uc2 "You'll likely see more and more attention and investment into this area," IDC's Mr. Zhang said. "The use cases in various industries and businesses are only increasing."\par \par \uc2 Josh Chin in Beijing contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Liza Lin at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Liza.Lin@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Liza.Lin@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related Coverage\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-all-seeing-surveillance-state-feared-in-the-west-is-a-reality-in-china-1498493020"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 China's All-Seeing Surveillance State Is Reading Its Citizens' Faces}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-facial-recognition-works/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How Facial Recognition Works}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20170711ed7b0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Its interest in pursuing a multibillion-dollar transatlantic takeover emerged less than a week after the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  gave the industry the go-ahead to make the biggest payouts to shareholders in almost a decade.\par \par \uc2 The takeover excitement was shortlived. \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , run by chairman and chief executive \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2 , scotched investors' hopes of a bid battle when it told the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  it had been at only a "very early" stage of considering an offer, and walked away . The bank's withdrawal left the field open for \uc2 Vantiv\uc2 , \uc2 Worldpay\uc2 's Ohio-based payments peer, to seal the deal for \u163\'00\'A39.1bn.\par \par \uc2 But the bank's approach has attracted attention in part because M&A involving the largest US lenders has been in a deep freeze since the aftermath of the crisis. Venkat Badinehal, head of US Financial Institutions investment banking at \uc2 RBC Capital Markets\uc2 , says: "The environment is more conducive to bank dealmaking. I wouldn't say it's fully charged yet, but it's a lot better than it used to be."\par \par \uc2 Regulators have frowned upon the likes of \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and rivals \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  making acquisitions, at least of other banks. Much of the US banking industry has been in retreat, under pressure to shrink and become less complex. Buying has been largely defensive and confined to the small and mid-sized end of the sector.\par \par \uc2 Almost 10 years on from the crisis, some dealmakers are dusting down their pitch books. "It's unlikely you're going to see one of the top six banks acquire another one of the top six banks or another large organisation over $250bn in assets any time soon," says Edwin del Hierro, partner and financial services specialist at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. However, he adds: "Certainly outside the depository space, I think the biggest banks will begin to do deals."\par \par \uc2 For some on Wall Street, the clean bill of health that the Fed gave the sector last week was a turning point. The regulator waved through dividends and share buybacks that equate to almost all the industry's forecast profits over the coming year. While hardly sufficient to pave the way for a bout of dealmaking, the Fed's approval to the payouts shows the banks are finally shaking off the shackles of the crisis.\par \par \uc2 US banks' post-crisis legal difficulties are also subsiding. Unlike several peers in Europe, they have reached settlements with American authorities over mis-sold mortgage securities. A report published by the rating agency \uc2 Moody's\uc2  this week showed that total litigation provisions for the biggest North American investment banks fell from $33bn in 2014 to $3bn last year.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile bank share prices, the currency used in stock-based acquisitions, have strengthened. S&P 500 bank stocks are up about a third since \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 's election last November.\par \par \uc2 There are plenty of reasons to doubt that big banks are about to embark on a dealmaking drive that would consolidate the industry. US rules prevent purchases that would push a bank's share of deposits above 10 per cent. Furthermore, a raft of financial safety rules - including a surcharge applied to the most "systemically important" institutions - strongly discourage banks from buying capital-intensive assets.\par \par \uc2 In any case, as more customers switch to online or mobile banking some analysts doubt big lenders have much appetite for acquiring domestic rivals with large branch networks.\par \par \uc2 Far more likely targets, bankers say, are companies in financial technology. In payments, incumbent financial institutions risk being caught out by "fintech" businesses such as Stripe and Square that facilitate faster and easier money transfers. Banks have been ramping up technology investments internally, but acquisitions could help fill gaps. Such operations tend to require far less capital than traditional banking assets and regulators are more likely to clear such purchases.\par \par \uc2 Karen Petrou, managing partner at \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a Washington-based consultancy, says the stress test success "gives the big banks more ammunition. It could be fired at opportunities such as acquisitions of fee-based businesses, and pushing at the edges of non-traditional activity." But she remains cautious: "The US banking industry is frisky but not yet animal."\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170708ed780003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

It is also poised to overtake \uc2 Intel\uc2  as the world's largest chip producer. Yet its valuation looks out of kilter with its ascendancy.\par \par \uc2 The South Korean group estimates it will achieve its largest quarterly profit, at Won14tn ($12.1bn), for the quarter to June. Analysts expect Apple to make about $10.5bn. \uc2 Samsung\uc2  produces and consumes the memory chips that power smartphones, cloud computing servers and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  applications. It supplies half of all DRAM chips worldwide. That market, spurred by new non-phone sources of demand for memory chips (DRAM for processors and NAND for flash memory), is expected to grow 67 per cent this year to $121bn, according to Nomura.\par \par \uc2 Detractors warn that any cycle must turn, and buying cyclicals on peak earnings can be risky. But not just yet. Commercial demand from cloud servers does not face obvious saturation limits, in contrast to personal devices. And chip suppliers have consolidated, which makes price wars less likely.\par \par \uc2 While smartphone sales growth is indeed slowing, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  is positioned well in high-growth segments of the supply chain for new models. The iPhone 8 will rely heavily on \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's ability to produce OLED display technology. By 2020, four-fifths of Apple devices will deploy OLED, from just a tenth now.\par \par \uc2 Supply constraints will ease in the end. \uc2 Samsung\uc2  has announced Won20tn of new investment in the chip business by 2021. Others, too, will ramp up production. It will take years for these plants to achieve full capacity. More likely they will support unit sales growth rather than squeeze profit margins.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's shares trade around 8 times their forecast earnings, close to their 2015 trough, and half Apple's rating. An extending cycle will surely take the valuation higher.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170708ed7800033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But they are now putting \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to work at the heart of operations among their star traders, allocating funds and analysing data to develop strategies.\par \par \uc2 "There has been a lot of talk about automation of the back office," Beatriz Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez, chief operating officer of UBS's investment bank, told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 . "But we decided to start a conversation with the front-office guys on whether there were processes we could use a robot to do and we found a number of them."\par \par \uc2 The first example is a relatively simple automated program for dealing with clients' post-trade allocation requests. The system, which \uc2 UBS\uc2  developed with Deloitte, scans emails sent by clients detailing how they want to allocate block trades between funds. It then processes these and executes the transfers.\par \par \uc2 It saves time by doing a task that would normally take a person about 45 minutes in only about two minutes, while freeing investment bankers up for other tasks, such as calling clients.\par \par \uc2 "The robot can pick up the email and do the whole allocation," said Ms Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez, watching the system process client requests on a big screen. "It frees people up to do more complex tasks."\par \par \uc2 The second of its new systems uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to develop strategies for trading volatility. It examines vast amounts of data and builds a strategy based on learning from market patterns.\par \par \uc2 UBS\uc2  claims it is the first "adaptive strategy" product offered by an investment bank. It has been marketing the offering to clients for a couple of months and they have been "very receptive". While the bank is yet to convince a client to put its money into it, the group expects to secure its first contract within months.\par \par \uc2 Several other banks have introduced \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  into their client-facing operations. \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  has developed a similar system based on \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  for its equities business, which helps to analyse the best way to execute a big block trade by reading market conditions.\par \par \uc2 UBS\uc2  turned to Tradelegs , a New York fintech specialising in trading \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , to develop its new system.\par \par \uc2 When the strategies were back-tested by looking at how they would have performed, they achieved annualised returns of 10.3 per cent, easily outperforming the 6.9 per cent returns of the benchmark S&P PutWrite index.\par \par \uc2 "The \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  comes up with a trading optimisation strategy that is then validated by humans," said Ms Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez, adding that it was likely to be "several years" before computers were let loose to execute trades without bankers first approving them.\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  has housed a Quantitative Investment Strategies unit in its asset management arm for more than a decade. \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  is rolling out \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms to support brokers at its wealth management arm. However, \uc2 UBS\uc2  says it is one of the first to introduce the technology into an investment bank's trading floor.\par \par \uc2 "If we are honest about the maturity of the industry, most of the AI success seems currently about doing what people do in terms of process, but more efficiently," said a senior innovation executive at a rival bank.\par \par \uc2 "Even extracting sentiment, which I have seen \uc2 IBM\uc2  do on a paragraph or a sentence or a story, it basically follows a set of rules that can explain why something is the way it is," said the executive. "Even the learning bit - you feed a machine a thousand pictures of a hot dog and it will soon learn what a hot dog looks like."\par \par \uc2 The explosion of superfast, computer-powered trading outfits - many at hedge funds - has already raised concerns about links to a series of sudden, sharp movements in markets. The arrival of robots among the traders is likely to accentuate these "flash crash" worries.\par \par \uc2 However, Ms Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez is confident the risks are minimal. "In the future it will start to make predictions about what will happen [to market volatility] and clients could trade on these," she said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170708ed780000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The controversy over Obamacare and now the raucous debate over its possible repeal and replacement have taken center stage recently in American politics. But health insurance isn't the only health-care problem facing us -- and maybe not even the most important one. No matter how the debate in Washington plays out in the weeks ahead, we will still be stuck with astronomical and ever-rising health-care costs. The U.S. now spends well over $10,000 per capita on health care each year. A recent analysis in the journal Health Affairs by the economist Sean P. Keehan and his colleagues at the federal \uc2 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\uc2  projects that health spending in the U.S. will grow at a rate of 5.8% a year through 2025, far outpacing GDP growth.\par \par \uc2 Our health-care system is uniquely inefficient and wasteful. The more than $3 trillion that we spend each year yields relatively poor health outcomes, compared with other developed countries that spend far less. Providing better health insurance and access can help with these problems, but real progress in containing costs and improving care will require transforming the practice of medicine itself -- how we diagnose and treat patients and how patients interact with medical professionals. In medical training, private sector R&D, doctor-patient relations and public policy, we need to move much more aggressively into the era of smart medicine, using high-tech tools to tailor more precise and economical care for individual patients. This transition won't be easy or fast -- the culture of medical practice is famously conservative, and new technology always raises new concerns -- but it has to be part of the solution to our health-care woes.\par \par \uc2 Radical new possibilities in medical care are not some far-off fantasy. Last week in my clinic I saw a 59-year-old man with hypertension, high cholesterol and intermittent atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disturbance). Before our visit, he had sent me a screenshot graph of over 100 blood pressure readings that he had taken in recent weeks with his smartphone-connected wristband. He had noticed some spikes in his evening blood pressure, and we had already changed the dose and timing of his medication; the spikes were now nicely controlled. Having lost 15 pounds in the past four months, he had also been pleased to see that he was having far fewer atrial fibrillation episodes -- which he knew from the credit-card-size electrocardiogram sensor attached to his smartphone.\par \par \uc2 In my three decades as a doctor, I have never seen such an acceleration of new technology, both hardware and software, across every dimension of medical practice. I have also had the opportunity to advise and collaborate with several companies on these developments. The new tools are not just more powerful, precise and convenient; they are more economical, driven by the information revolution's ability to deliver, as Moore's Law holds, ever-increasing computing power for less money.\par \par \uc2 Consider the biggest line items in the 2016 national health-care budget, according to Mr. Keehan and his colleagues: more than $1 trillion for hospital care, $670 billion for doctor and clinician services, $360 billion for drugs. And compare the often sorry outcomes: more than 1 in 4 patients harmed while in the hospital; more than 12 million serious diagnosis errors each year; a positive response rate of just 25% for patients on the top 10 prescription medications in gross sales.\par \par \uc2 We don't have to resign ourselves to this outrageous situation. Smart medicine offers a way out, enabling doctors to develop a precise, high-definition understanding of each person in their care. The key tools are cheaper sensors, simpler and more routine imaging, and regular use of now widely available genetic analysis. As for using all this new data, here too a revolution is under way. Algorithms and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  are making it possible for doctors to rapidly apply relevant medical literature to their patients' cases, while "\b \highlight22\uc2 natural language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2 " (that is, talking to computers) holds the promise of liberating them from keyboards during office visits.\par \par \uc2 One obvious practical effect of these developments will be to replace hospital stays with remote monitoring in the patient's home. The \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  has already approved wearable sensors that can continuously monitor all vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, body temperature, breathing rate and oxygen concentration in the blood. The cost to do this for weeks would be a tiny fraction of the cost for a day in the hospital. Patients will be able to avoid serious hospital-acquired infections and get to sleep in their own beds, surrounded by family.\par \par \uc2 We do more than 125 million ultrasound scans a year in the U.S., at an average charge of well over $800 -- that's $100 billion. But we now have ultrasound probes that connect with a smartphone and provide exquisite resolution comparable to hospital lab machines. It is possible to examine any part of the body (except the brain) simply by connecting the probe to the base of a smartphone and putting a little gel on the probe's tip. When I first got a smartphone ultrasound probe last year, I did a head-to-toe "medical selfie," imaging everything from my sinuses and thyroid to my heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, aorta and left foot.\par \par \uc2 That experience came in handy when I recently developed pain in my flank. Seeing my very dilated kidney on my smartphone screen helped to confirm the diagnosis that I had a kidney stone. The CT scan later ordered by my doctor showed a nearly identical image, but the charge for that was $2,200. If this single tool was used in a typical office visit, a large proportion of expensive and unnecessary formal scans could be avoided.\par \par \uc2 Smart medicine can also bring some sanity to how we handle medical screening, which today results in an epidemic of misdiagnoses and unnecessary procedures and treatments. The leading culprits are routine tests for breast and prostate cancer for individuals at low risk for these diseases. Because the tests have such extraordinarily high rates of false positives, they result all too often in biopsies, radiation and surgery for people in no medical danger.\par \par \uc2 It would not be hard to use screening tests in a more discriminating way, for the much smaller population that really should worry about certain serious health problems. Genome sequencing for an individual -- identifying all three billion base pairs in a person's genetic makeup -- can now be done for about $1,000, and we know a great deal about which genes predispose someone to conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Guided by genomic risk scores that can be determined with an inexpensive device known as a gene "chip" -- and, of course, by family histories and clinical examinations -- doctors could spare many families from the ordeal of unnecessary treatment while making a dent in the $15 billion spent each year in the U.S. on mass screening for breast and prostate cancer.\par \par \uc2 Routine use of individual genetic information could also allow us to prescribe drugs more effectively, avoiding the waste, in clinical time and in money, caused by medications that misfire. More than 130 drugs in common use have an \uc2 FDA\uc2  label for DNA data -- that is, they provide peer-reviewed research instructing doctors about dosage, side effects and potential responsiveness for patients with particular genetic profiles. But with rare exceptions outside of some cancer treatment centers, doctors in the U.S. don't obtain such data before prescribing drugs. That's a shame, because the relevant genetic information for each patient could be determined easily and inexpensively from saliva DNA at an office visit or even a pharmacy.\par \par \uc2 For its part, the drug industry needs to make genetic information available for far more drugs by making it a regular part of testing. This R&D effort would be inexpensive relative to the cost of developing a new drug, and it could make medications far more efficient, upping the response rate and averting dangerous side effects.\par \par \uc2 Smart medicine can also transform the doctor-patient relationship. Most medical services today are still provided in the traditional outpatient setting of a doctor's office. It takes an average of 3.4 weeks to get a primary care appointment in the U.S., and there's little time allotted for each visit. Most doctors provide a minimum of eye-to-eye contact as they busily record the session on a keyboard.\par \par \uc2 The frustrations and inefficiencies of this system are obvious -- and unnecessary. In the era of telemedicine consults, there is no reason to wait weeks for an appointment. For the same copay as an office visit, connection with a doctor can occur instantly or within minutes. With increasing use of patient-generated data from sensors and physical exam hardware that connects with a smartphone, the video chats of today will soon be enriched by extensive data transfer.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, obtaining patient data solely from the occasional office visit is no way to get a full picture of someone's health or to assess their medical needs. As more people generate and maintain their own medical data, they will carry this information around with them, no longer leaving it in the exclusive domain of doctors.\par \par \uc2 At the \uc2 Scripps Research Institute\uc2 , we are working with the support of a \uc2 National Institutes of Health\uc2  grant and several local partners to develop a comprehensive "health record of the future" for individual patients. It will combine all the usual medical data -- from office visits, labs, scans -- with data generated by personal sensors, including sleep, physical activity, weight, environment, blood pressure and other relevant medical metrics. All of it will be constantly and seamlessly updated and owned by the individual patient.\par \par \uc2 Such medical data belongs to us rather than to our doctors -- it's about our bodies, after all, and we generate and pay for much of it. But it will also make our medical care more exact, more precisely tailored, as we move from doctor to doctor, depending on our needs at a particular moment. It will make unnecessary the billions of dollars spent each year in the duplication of labs and scans. Personal medical data -- stored in a cloud or using blockchain technology, a kind of digital ledger -- also will be more secure and relatively immune to hacking, compared with data sitting on massive servers.\par \par \uc2 Having such data readily available will be vital to reaching the next stage of smart medicine, with virtual medical coaches. Just as we have adopted Alexa, Siri and Cortana for daily activities, we are headed to a time in the years ahead when our continuously updated personal medical data will provide health guidance. Consider the diabetic whose blood sugar sensor indicates that control is slipping because of lack of sleep or physical activity, or the asthmatic whose sensors show reduced lung function before any symptoms occur, so that she can adjust her medications. Refined feedback, through text, voice or avatar, will ultimately lead to better prevention and management of medical conditions.\par \par \uc2 The revolution in patient data will empower doctors too, particularly as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  matures into practical technologies. Researchers at \uc2 Google DeepMind\uc2  and \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  have recently shown the great potential of "\b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 " -- computers that grow ever smarter through the continuous analysis of new data -- for accurate interpretation of medical scans, pathology slides and skin lesions, on par with doctors. In a paper last year in the Journal of the \uc2 American Medical Association\uc2 , authors Andrew Beam and Isaac Kohane, specialists in biomedical informatics, calculated that advances in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  now make it possible for computers to read as many as 260 million medical scans in a day, at a cost of $1,000. The advances in diagnostic power would be enormous, to say nothing of the cost savings.\par \par \uc2 So why have we been so slow to adopt and encourage these potential solutions? Medicine is hard to change, especially when reforms threaten established modes of payment and the customary control of patients. And like everyone else, doctors are seldom eager for extensive new training. But our current course of medical spending and practice is unsustainable, and no change in how we handle health insurance is likely to alter that reality.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, serious ventures in smart medicine are well along. My colleagues and I at the \uc2 Scripps Research Institute\uc2  are leading the Participant Center of the NIH's Precision Medicine Initiative, which is currently enrolling one million Americans. Volunteers in the program will be testing many of the new tools I have described here. The recently formed nonprofit Health Transformation Alliance, which includes more than 40 large companies providing health benefits to 6.5 million employees and family members, intends to address the high cost of health care by focusing on, among other things, the sophisticated use of personal data.\par \par \uc2 Physicians will also need to be trained to use the new technologies, from interpreting genomic data to using a smartphone for ultrasound. The \uc2 FDA\uc2  recently announced a broad initiative to foster innovation in digital health devices, with the intent to streamline the regulatory review process.\par \par \uc2 But more could certainly be done to move us toward better health outcomes at lower costs. Perhaps some enterprising member of Congress will propose a Frugal Health Care Innovation Act, providing government incentives for technology, research and implementation. Such public support for electric cars has rapidly changed the face of the whole auto industry. American medicine today is no less antiquated than the Detroit of a generation ago, and it needs to find its way into the present century.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Dr. Topol is a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the \uc2 Scripps Research Institute\uc2  in San Diego and the author of "The Patient Will See You Now: The Future of Medicine Is in Your Hands" (Basic Books, 2015). He consults for \uc2 Illumina\uc2  and Apple on some of the issues discussed here, sits on the board of directors of Dexcom and is a co-founder of YouBase.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Smart Medicine Can Help, but More Is Needed" -- WSJ July 15, 2017)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20170708000044"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020170708ed780001d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Robots are moving on to the trading floors of investment banks. \uc2 UBS\uc2  this week showcased how two \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  systems can help traders perform better at the Swiss bank\u8217\'20\'19s futuristic new City of London office.\par \par \uc2 Many of the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest banks have for years been automating manual, repetitive tasks done by support staff to save money. But now they are putting the latest forms of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to work at the heart of operations among their star traders, allocating funds and analysing data to develop strategies.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere has been a lot of talk about automation of the back office,\u8221\'20\'1D Beatriz Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez, chief operating officer of UBS\u8217\'20\'19s investment bank, told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CBut we decided to start a conversation with the front-office guys on whether there were processes we could use a robot to do and we found a number of them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The first example is a relatively simple, automated programme for dealing with clients\u8217\'20\'19 post-trade allocation requests. The system, which \uc2 UBS\uc2  developed with Deloitte, scans for emails sent by clients detailing how they want to divide large block trades up between funds. It then processes these and executes the transfers.\par \par \uc2 It saves time by doing a task that would normally take a person about 45 minutes in only about two minutes, while freeing investment bankers up for other tasks, such as calling clients.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe robot can pick up the email and do the whole allocation,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez, watching the system swiftly process client requests on a big screen in the ultra-modern headquarters that \uc2 UBS\uc2  recently built for its investment bank in London. \u8220\'20\'1CIt frees people up to do more complex tasks.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The second of its new systems uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to develop new strategies for trading volatility on behalf of clients. It examines vast amounts of trading data and builds a strategy based on learning from market patterns.\par \par \uc2 UBS\uc2  claims it is the first \u8220\'20\'1Cadaptive strategy\u8221\'20\'1D product offered by an investment bank. It has been marketing the offering to clients for a couple of months and they have been \u8220\'20\'1Cvery receptive\u8221\'20\'1D. While the bank is yet to convince a client to put its money into it, it expects to secure its first contract within a few months.\par \par \uc2 Several other banks have introduced \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  into their client-facing operations. \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  has developed a similar system based on \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  for its equities business, which helps to analyse the best way to execute a big block trade by reading market conditions.\par \par \uc2 UBS\uc2  turned to Tradelegs, a New York fintech specialising in trading \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , to develop its new system.\par \par \uc2 When the strategies were back-tested by looking at how they would have performed, they achieved annualised returns of 10.3 per cent, easily outperforming the 6.9 per cent returns of the benchmark S&P Put-Write index.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  comes up with a trading optimisation strategy that is then validated by humans,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez, adding that it was likely to be \u8220\'20\'1Cseveral years\u8221\'20\'1D before computers were let loose to execute trades without them first being approved by bankers.\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  has housed a Quantitative Investment Strategies unit in its asset management arm for more than a decade. \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  is rolling out \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms to support brokers at its wealth management arm. But \uc2 UBS\uc2  says it is one of the first to introduce the technology into an investment bank\u8217\'20\'19s trading floor.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf we are honest about the maturity of the industry, most of the AI success seems currently about doing what people do in terms of process, but more efficiently,\u8221\'20\'1D said a senior innovation executive at a rival bank.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEven extracting sentiment, which I have seen \uc2 IBM\uc2  do on a paragraph or a sentence or a story, it basically follows a set of rules that can explain why something is the way it is,\u8221\'20\'1D said the executive. \u8220\'20\'1CEven the learning bit \u8212\'20\'14 you feed a machine a thousand pictures of a hot dog and it will soon learn what a hot dog looks like.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The explosion of superfast, computer-powered trading outfits \u8212\'20\'14 many at hedge funds \u8212\'20\'14 has already raised concerns about links to a series of sudden, sharp movements in markets. The arrival of robots among the traders is likely to accentuate these \u8220\'20\'1Cflash crash\u8221\'20\'1D worries.\par \par \uc2 But Ms Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Jim\u233\'00\'E9nez is confident the risks are minimal. \u8220\'20\'1CIn the future it will start to make predictions about what will happen [to market volatility] and clients could trade on these,\u8221\'20\'1D she said.\par \par \uc2 The rival\u8217\'20\'19s innovation executive said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe have such systems \u8212\'20\'14 and I am sure others do \u8212\'20\'14 that use \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to adapt a strategy to a specific client need at a specific time. These strategies require significant computing power and science to tailor, but are becoming more prevalent all the time. It is an interesting story I think.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170707ed77000p3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Louis Dreyfus, another agricultural commodity trader, has been developing its algorithmic research capabilities. \uc2 Gonzalo Ram\u237\'00\'EDrez Martiarena\uc2  , its chief executive, told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  Commodities Global Summit this year that he was working to further the group's "algorithmic predictive analysis".\par \par \uc2 Until recently, commodity markets have been driven by supply and demand factors of the physical raw material, with players commanding extra information on physical flows gaining an edge over other market participants.\par \par \uc2 However, the markets have become more accessible to a larger number of investors thanks to the rise in information availability. Many commodity trading houses have looked to buy assets such as refineries, storage capacity and ports to increase access to information and gain control of distribution networks.\par \par \uc2 The digitisation of commodity trading is the latest development in the sector. Many "old style" traders are struggling against computer models that process information in nanoseconds rather than milliseconds.\par \par \uc2 Speculative trading in agricultural commodities came under fire during the 2008-09 food price crisis that sparked riots in several countries, and the surge in grain prices after the 2012 US drought.\par \par \uc2 Despite the criticism, short-term trading in food commodities by speculators such as hedge funds has risen, accounting for almost half the volume in the futures contracts traded.\par \par \uc2 According to a government study by two \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  research analysts, automated trading systems account for 48 per cent of all agricultural futures contracts on the \uc2 CME\uc2  compared with 38 per cent two years ago.\par \par \uc2 As a result, investors and traders are watching the positions taken by speculative investors disclosed by the CFTC closer than ever before as price swings in agricultural commodities over the past few years have been closely linked to their bets.\par \par \uc2 While the direction of the trades are defined broadly by supply and demand, computer models are also reacting to technical factors as well as macro reasons such as interest rates, foreign exchange and equity movements.\par \par \uc2 "Most of the daily volume you see trading is coming from algos," said Santiago Torres Leon of Pathway Agriculture, an investment manager in Geneva. A small advantage over other players was not enough. "There is so much noise that a small edge in fundamentals is no edge at all," he said.\par \par \uc2 Antti Belt and Eric Boudier, of \uc2 Boston Consulting Group\uc2 , say "the historical practice of trading by intuition, supported by limited \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , is being replaced by systematic, machine-based trading that utilises algorithms to support the collection and treatment of information and decision making process".\par \par \uc2 They advise that to compete in such an environment, market participants will need to invest in trading infrastructure and personnel who focus on software development and mathematics.\par \par \uc2 Emiko Terazono; additional reporting by \uc2 Gregory Meyer\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170707ed770002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

To contain costs and improve results, we need to move aggressively to adopt the tools of information-age medicine\b0\par\par\uc2 By Eric Topol \par \uc2 2,403 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 July 2017\par 17:04\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The controversy over Obamacare and now the raucous debate over its possible repeal and replacement have taken center stage recently in American politics. But health insurance isn't the only health-care problem facing us\u8212\'20\'14and maybe not even the most important one. No matter how the debate in Washington plays out in the weeks ahead, we will still be stuck with astronomical and ever-rising health-care costs. The U.S. now spends well over $10,000 per capita on health care each year. A recent analysis in the journal Health Affairs by the economist Sean P. Keehan and his colleagues at the federal \uc2 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\uc2  projects that health spending in the U.S. will grow at a rate of 5.8% a year through 2025, far outpacing GDP growth.\par \par \uc2 Our health-care system is uniquely inefficient and wasteful. The more than $3 trillion that we spend each year yields relatively poor health outcomes, compared with other developed countries that spend far less. Providing better health insurance and access can help with these problems, but real progress in containing costs and improving care will require transforming the practice of medicine itself\u8212\'20\'14how we diagnose and treat patients and how patients interact with medical professionals. In medical training, private sector R&D, doctor-patient relations and public policy, we need to move much more aggressively into the era of smart medicine, using high-tech tools to tailor more precise and economical care for individual patients. This transition won't be easy or fast\u8212\'20\'14the culture of medical practice is famously conservative, and new technology always raises new concerns\u8212\'20\'14but it has to be part of the solution to our health-care woes.\par \par \uc2 Radical new possibilities in medical care are not some far-off fantasy. Last week in my clinic I saw a 59-year-old man with hypertension, high cholesterol and intermittent atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disturbance). Before our visit, he had sent me a screenshot graph of over 100 blood pressure readings that he had taken in recent weeks with his smartphone-connected wristband. He had noticed some spikes in his evening blood pressure, and we had already changed the dose and timing of his medication; the spikes were now nicely controlled. Having lost 15 pounds in the past four months, he had also been pleased to see that he was having far fewer atrial fibrillation episodes\u8212\'20\'14which he knew from the credit-card-size electrocardiogram sensor attached to his smartphone.\par \par \uc2 In my three decades as a doctor, I have never seen such an acceleration of new technology, both hardware and software, across every dimension of medical practice. I have also had the opportunity to advise and collaborate with several companies on these developments. The new tools are not just more powerful, precise and convenient; they are more economical, driven by the information revolution's ability to deliver, as Moore's Law holds, ever-increasing computing power for less money.\par \par \uc2 Consider the biggest line items in the 2016 national health-care budget, according to Mr. Keehan and his colleagues: more than $1 trillion for hospital care, $670 billion for doctor and clinician services, $360 billion for drugs. And compare the often sorry outcomes: more than 1 in 4 patients harmed while in the hospital; more than 12 million serious diagnosis errors each year; a positive response rate of just 25% for patients on the top 10 prescription medications in gross sales.\par \par \uc2 We don't have to resign ourselves to this outrageous situation. Smart medicine offers a way out, enabling doctors to develop a precise, high-definition understanding of each person in their care. The key tools are cheaper sensors, simpler and more routine imaging, and regular use of now widely available genetic analysis. As for using all this new data, here too a revolution is under way. Algorithms and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  are making it possible for doctors to rapidly apply relevant medical literature to their patients' cases, while "\b \highlight22\uc2 natural language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2 " (that is, talking to computers) holds the promise of liberating them from keyboards during office visits.\par \par \uc2 One obvious practical effect of these developments will be to replace hospital stays with remote monitoring in the patient's home. The \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  has already approved wearable sensors that can continuously monitor all vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, body temperature, breathing rate and oxygen concentration in the blood. The cost to do this for weeks would be a tiny fraction of the cost for a day in the hospital. Patients will be able to avoid serious hospital-acquired infections and get to sleep in their own beds, surrounded by family.\par \par \uc2 We do more than 125 million ultrasound scans a year in the U.S., at an average charge of well over $800\u8212\'20\'14that's $100 billion. But we now have ultrasound probes that connect with a smartphone and provide exquisite resolution comparable to hospital lab machines. It is possible to examine any part of the body (except the brain) simply by connecting the probe to the base of a smartphone and putting a little gel on the probe's tip. When I first got a smartphone ultrasound probe last year, I did a head-to-toe "medical selfie," imaging everything from my sinuses and thyroid to my heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, aorta and left foot.\par \par \uc2 That experience came in handy when I recently developed pain in my flank. Seeing my very dilated kidney on my smartphone screen helped to confirm the diagnosis that I had a kidney stone. The CT scan later ordered by my doctor showed a nearly identical image, but the charge for that was $2,200. If this single tool was used in a typical office visit, a large proportion of expensive and unnecessary formal scans could be avoided.\par \par \uc2 Smart medicine can also bring some sanity to how we handle medical screening, which today results in an epidemic of misdiagnoses and unnecessary procedures and treatments. The leading culprits are routine tests for breast and prostate cancer for individuals at low risk for these diseases. Because the tests have such extraordinarily high rates of false positives, they result all too often in biopsies, radiation and surgery for people in no medical danger.\par \par \uc2 It would not be hard to use screening tests in a more discriminating way, for the much smaller population that really should worry about certain serious health problems. Genome sequencing for an individual\u8212\'20\'14identifying all three billion base pairs in a person's genetic makeup\u8212\'20\'14can now be done for about $1,000, and we know a great deal about which genes predispose someone to conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Guided by genomic risk scores that can be determined with an inexpensive device known as a gene "chip"\u8212\'20\'14and, of course, by family histories and clinical examinations\u8212\'20\'14doctors could spare many families from the ordeal of unnecessary treatment while making a dent in the $15 billion spent each year in the U.S. on mass screening for breast and prostate cancer.\par \par \uc2 Routine use of individual genetic information could also allow us to prescribe drugs more effectively, avoiding the waste, in clinical time and in money, caused by medications that misfire. More than 130 drugs in common use have an \uc2 FDA\uc2  label for DNA data\u8212\'20\'14that is, they provide peer-reviewed research instructing doctors about dosage, side effects and potential responsiveness for patients with particular genetic profiles. But with rare exceptions outside of some cancer treatment centers, doctors in the U.S. don't obtain such data before prescribing drugs. That's a shame, because the relevant genetic information for each patient could be determined easily and inexpensively from saliva DNA at an office visit or even a pharmacy.\par \par \uc2 For its part, the drug industry needs to make genetic information available for far more drugs by making it a regular part of testing. This R&D effort would be inexpensive relative to the cost of developing a new drug, and it could make medications far more efficient, upping the response rate and averting dangerous side effects.\par \par \uc2 Smart medicine can also transform the doctor-patient relationship. Most medical services today are still provided in the traditional outpatient setting of a doctor's office. It takes an average of 3.4 weeks to get a primary care appointment in the U.S., and there's little time allotted for each visit. Most doctors provide a minimum of eye-to-eye contact as they busily record the session on a keyboard.\par \par \uc2 The frustrations and inefficiencies of this system are obvious\u8212\'20\'14and unnecessary. In the era of telemedicine consults, there is no reason to wait weeks for an appointment. For the same copay as an office visit, connection with a doctor can occur instantly or within minutes. With increasing use of patient-generated data from sensors and physical exam hardware that connects with a smartphone, the video chats of today will soon be enriched by extensive data transfer.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, obtaining patient data solely from the occasional office visit is no way to get a full picture of someone's health or to assess their medical needs. As more people generate and maintain their own medical data, they will carry this information around with them, no longer leaving it in the exclusive domain of doctors.\par \par \uc2 At the \uc2 Scripps Research Institute\uc2 , we are working with the support of a \uc2 National Institutes of Health\uc2  grant and several local partners to develop a comprehensive "health record of the future" for individual patients. It will combine all the usual medical data\u8212\'20\'14from office visits, labs, scans\u8212\'20\'14with data generated by personal sensors, including sleep, physical activity, weight, environment, blood pressure and other relevant medical metrics. All of it will be constantly and seamlessly updated and owned by the individual patient.\par \par \uc2 Such medical data belongs to us rather than to our doctors\u8212\'20\'14it's about our bodies, after all, and we generate and pay for much of it. But it will also make our medical care more exact, more precisely tailored, as we move from doctor to doctor, depending on our needs at a particular moment. It will make unnecessary the billions of dollars spent each year in the duplication of labs and scans. Personal medical data\u8212\'20\'14stored in a cloud or using blockchain technology, a kind of digital ledger\u8212\'20\'14also will be more secure and relatively immune to hacking, compared with data sitting on massive servers.\par \par \uc2 Having such data readily available will be vital to reaching the next stage of smart medicine, with virtual medical coaches. Just as we have adopted Alexa, Siri and Cortana for daily activities, we are headed to a time in the years ahead when our continuously updated personal medical data will provide health guidance. Consider the diabetic whose blood sugar sensor indicates that control is slipping because of lack of sleep or physical activity, or the asthmatic whose sensors show reduced lung function before any symptoms occur, so that she can adjust her medications. Refined feedback, through text, voice or avatar, will ultimately lead to better prevention and management of medical conditions.\par \par \uc2 The revolution in patient data will empower doctors too, particularly as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  matures into practical technologies. Researchers at \uc2 Google DeepMind\uc2  and \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  have recently shown the great potential of "\b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 "\u8212\'20\'14computers that grow ever smarter through the continuous analysis of new data\u8212\'20\'14for accurate interpretation of medical scans, pathology slides and skin lesions, on par with doctors. In a paper last year in the Journal of the \uc2 American Medical Association\uc2 , authors Andrew Beam and Isaac Kohane, specialists in biomedical informatics, calculated that advances in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  now make it possible for computers to read as many as 260 million medical scans in a day, at a cost of $1,000. The advances in diagnostic power would be enormous, to say nothing of the cost savings.\par \par \uc2 So why have we been so slow to adopt and encourage these potential solutions? Medicine is hard to change, especially when reforms threaten established modes of payment and the customary control of patients. And like everyone else, doctors are seldom eager for extensive new training. But our current course of medical spending and practice is unsustainable, and no change in how we handle health insurance is likely to alter that reality.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, serious ventures in smart medicine are well along. My colleagues and I at the \uc2 Scripps Research Institute\uc2  are leading the Participant Center of the NIH's Precision Medicine Initiative, which is currently enrolling one million Americans. Volunteers in the program will be testing many of the new tools I have described here. The recently formed nonprofit Health Transformation Alliance, which includes more than 40 large companies providing health benefits to 6.5 million employees and family members, intends to address the high cost of health care by focusing on, among other things, the sophisticated use of personal data.\par \par \uc2 Physicians will also need to be trained to use the new technologies, from interpreting genomic data to using a smartphone for ultrasound. The \uc2 FDA\uc2  recently announced a broad initiative to foster innovation in digital health devices, with the intent to streamline the regulatory review process.\par \par \uc2 But more could certainly be done to move us toward better health outcomes at lower costs. Perhaps some enterprising member of Congress will propose a Frugal Health Care Innovation Act, providing government incentives for technology, research and implementation. Such public support for electric cars has rapidly changed the face of the whole auto industry. American medicine today is no less antiquated than the Detroit of a generation ago, and it needs to find its way into the present century.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Topol is a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the \uc2 Scripps Research Institute\uc2  in San Diego and the author of "The Patient Will See You Now: The Future of Medicine Is in Your Hands" (Basic Books, 2015). He consults for \uc2 Illumina\uc2  and Apple on some of the issues discussed here, sits on the board of directors of Dexcom and is a co-founder of YouBase.\par \par \uc2 Related reading\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/graphics/american-health-care-costs/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The High Cost of Health Care in America}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-giving-health-care-consumers-a-nudge-1498442400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Case for Giving Health-Care Consumers a 'Nudge'}}}\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\jpegblip\picw400\pich391\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal6000\pichgoal5865

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Wall Street bankers and Silicon Valley executives thrive on networking. \uc2 Scott Stanford\uc2  has perfected the art.\par \par \uc2 His r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 is replete with elite credentials\u8212\'20\'14undergraduate and business degrees from \uc2 Harvard University\uc2 , investment banking at \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . and a stint at a dot.com flop. But he stands out for his social network, considered vast even among the business elite.\par \par \uc2 He helped \uc2 Arianna Huffington\uc2  find financing for the Huffington Post during the financial crisis, she says. \uc2 Spotify AB\uc2  Chief Executive \uc2 Daniel Ek\uc2  is a longtime friend, say people who know them. Barack Obama's election guru Jim Messina is an official business adviser. Michelle Phan, a co-founder of online makeup company Ipsy, counts on him for business guidance, according to someone who knows them both. And investor \uc2 Yuri Milner\uc2  credits him with introducing Mr. Milner to Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 "I will be forever grateful to him," Mr. Milner says of Mr. Stanford. "I really didn't know anyone in Silicon Valley. He literally paved the way for us to become global investors."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stanford's main job is running venture firm \uc2 Sherpa Capital\uc2 , which he co-founded four years ago with \uc2 Shervin Pishevar\uc2 , also considered one of Silicon Valley's most hyper-networked individuals.\par \par \uc2 The question for Mr. Stanford is whether he can convert his connections into returns.\par \par \uc2 He says he has closely interwoven his personal and professional lives as far back as he can remember. At Sherpa, he says, "we're trying to open doors for founders that they didn't know existed."\par \par \uc2 A 47-year-old native of Indianapolis and videogame and science-fiction enthusiast, Mr. Stanford joined Goldman after his first matriculation at Harvard. He had transferred there from \uc2 Boston College\uc2 , after a dean, impressed by his coding skills, wrote a recommendation to the university, Mr. Stanford says.\par \par \uc2 After leaving Goldman and getting an M.B.A. at Harvard, he joined \uc2 LookSmart Ltd\uc2 . as a senior executive before the online-advertising firm's 1999 IPO.\par \par \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . was just getting started when he returned to Goldman in 2004 after \uc2 LookSmart\uc2 's valuation had collapsed. He sought out entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and internationally who were building social networks, which he saw as the next big internet business.\par \par \uc2 Several of Mr. Stanford's former associates at Goldman remember a one-page document he passed around outlining his "game-changing hypotheses" and how prescient some were. Among them: predicting that the large number of social networks would eventually morph into three or four that people would use for different things\u8212\'20\'14one for business and a separate one for their personal lives.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, when \uc2 Facebook\uc2  was looking for a sizable investment, Mr. Stanford brought Mr. Milner, a Russian entrepreneur, to Silicon Valley to meet the social network's key executives and advisers. "Scott and Yuri were really critical in helping us thinking about Russia and other parts of the world as being very important," says \uc2 Jim Breyer\uc2 , one of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's then-board members and earliest investors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Milner invested $200 million in \uc2 Facebook\uc2  in 2009 and several hundred million more in 2010 and 2011 to buy out employees and early investors as part of a $1.5 billion private fundraising that Mr. Stanford helped orchestrate\u8212\'20\'14at the time one of the largest pre-IPO financings ever. Mr. Milner earned returns of nearly 10 times his investment with the company's 2012 IPO and became a coveted investor for other tech companies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stanford also spearheaded Goldman's investment in \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . in 2011. The bank's $5 million investment has been valued in excess of $1 billion after the ride-hailing company's business ballooned.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stanford had seen the promise of several blockbuster companies "when many people didn't have the visibility or transparency into where they were going," says Goldman President and Co-Chief Operating Officer \uc2 David Solomon\uc2 , who is now a Sherpa investor.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, Mr. Stanford left Goldman to found Sherpa with Mr. Pishevar, who had been a managing director at Menlo Ventures.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pishevar led Menlo's investment in Uber around the same time Goldman got in. He and Mr. Stanford met shortly after that, when they were introduced to one another as the "Uber boys." Their firm's name comes from their idea of being "tireless servants and guides" to their portfolio companies, Mr. Stanford says.\par \par \uc2 Investors have put roughly $640 million into Sherpa, making it one of the fastest-growing venture firms launched in the past five years, according to research firm Preqin.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/17/in-search-of-the-next-uber-sherpa-ventures-raises-150-million/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Sherpa in 2014 participated in fundraising rounds}}}\uc2  for Uber and \uc2 Airbnb Inc\uc2 ., accumulating shares that have appreciated handsomely on paper. But not every bet has been a winner. Sherpa has written down some of its investments, such as used-car company Beepi Inc., which closed and for which the firm wrote off its entire $16.7 million investment. Other portfolio companies, including shipping-and-logistics company Shyp Inc. and online food-delivery service Munchery Inc., have restructured and announced job cuts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stanford, whose office bookshelves are lined with his decades-old \uc2 Wired\uc2  magazine collection, says he is fascinated by the promise of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Sherpa has poured millions into a startup called Replika, which promises a new virtual friend by using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to create personal chatbots that mimic a user's conversation style and personality.\par \par \uc2 Replika's 30-year-old founder, a recent Russian immigrant named Eugenia Kuyda, says the instant friendship she struck up with Mr. Stanford was a key reason she welcomed Sherpa as an investor.\par \par \uc2 "We were also new to the city, and Scott knows everyone," she says.\par \par \uc2 Write to \uc2 Maureen Farrell\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:maureen.farrell@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 maureen.farrell@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170707ed77004v1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Beijing has pulled back on plans to license technology groups to develop "social credit" scores for consumers, based mainly on their online activity, amid concern over conflicts of interest, industry analysts said yesterday.\par \par \uc2 The People's Bank of China\uc2 , the central bank, selected eight tech companies in 2015 - including ecommerce group Alibaba's \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2  and game developer Tencent - to develop pilot programs to give consumers credit scores .\par \par \uc2 The initiative was part of a government-backed effort to increase lending to hundreds of millions of Chinese who want access to small business loans or consumer credit but have no collateral or financial history. Beijing aimed to roll out a nationwide system by 2020.\par \par \uc2 The pilots, which monitored spending patterns but also personal behaviour and social media activity, initially raised concerns about consumer privacy . Some of their metrics were seen as irrelevant, including proposals to factor in exercise routines or what time of day people went online. Others were considered more sinister, such as efforts to rate "honesty" by linking credit scores to friends' social media posts.\par \par \uc2 Beijing has decided not to award any licences this year after regulators expressed concern about the potential for conflicts of interest. Their worries centre on the fact that many of the companies developing the systems also operate their own ecommerce and online financing arms and have proved reluctant to share data with rival platforms. This has made it difficult to establish scores for individuals.\par \par \uc2 "The biggest reason [for delaying the licences] is that the credit companies should be independent third parties, otherwise there could be a conflict of interest," said Li Ming, of the newly formed Beijing \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  Research Centre. "The door isn't closed to a truly independent third party."\par \par \uc2 The more cautious approach comes as regulators move to rein in risky financial behaviour. Most notably, the head of Anbang, the insurer, was last month detained because of concern about systemic risks from the purchase of overseas assets with money raised through high-interest financing products.\par \par \uc2 The PBoC is leaving open the possibility that the companies piloting the rating schemes could merge their credit scoring arms into an industry association, spin them off or find external partners, a government official said.\par \par \uc2 The central bank is examining more traditional ways to establish consumer credit ratings. But methods used in North America or Europe are not easily applied in China, because although mortgages and credit card use are becoming more common, most Chinese still lack a formal credit history.\par \par \uc2 The data-gathering scheme had been seen as a solution to that problem, given the proliferation of online shopping, banking and investment via platforms owned by private tech companies.\par \par \uc2 Alibaba's Sesame Credit system rates users partly on their purchases through Alibaba's online payment system Alipay, while \uc2 China Rapid Finance\uc2  draws on data scraped from Tencent.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see this as something the government will give up and they certainly don't want Alibaba and Tencent to grow more powerful than they are now," said Anne Stevenson-Yang, head of J Capital Research. "They want [consumers] to have a unique identifier and a single social credit record, so that would have to be managed by a government agency."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020170705ed7500013\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A rebound in technology shares boosted the S&P 500 on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The tech sector ended a three-session streak of declines and remains the best performer out of the 11 major groupings in the S&P 500 so far this year. The gains helped the Nasdaq Composite outperform its peers Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  rose 40.80 points, or 0.7%, to 6150.86 after falling for three- straight trading days. The S&P 500 rose 3.53 points, or 0.1%, to 2432.54 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.10 points, or less than 0.1%, to 21478.17.\par \par \uc2 Semiconductor stocks were some of the day's biggest gainers after chip maker \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  announced an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology partnership with Chinese internet giant Baidu. On Monday, the \uc2 Semiconductor Industry Association\uc2  said world-wide chip sales grew 22.6% in May compared with the same month a year prior, the largest such increase since September 2010.\par \par \uc2 Advanced Micro Devices\uc2  and \uc2 Micron Technology\uc2  were the S&P 500's two best performers by percentage increase Wednesday. \uc2 Advanced Micro Devices\uc2  rose $1.04, or 8.6%, to $13.19, while Micron gained 1.37, or 4.7%, to 30.51. \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  was among the 10 biggest gainers, adding 3.72, or 2.7%, to 143.05.\par \par \uc2 The tech sector is expected to help lead second-quarter earnings growth in the S&P 500, according to FactSet, but some investors and analysts are concerned that the group's outperformance has left it susceptible to a selloff.\par \par \uc2 With investors piling into and out of some of the biggest tech stocks recently, they will likely continue favoring companies with good cash flow, said Laurie Kamhi, managing director and partner of LCK Wealth Management at HighTower.\par \par \uc2 "There's going to be a huge disparity in the winners and losers," she said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, energy shares slid as oil prices tumbled anew.\par \par \uc2 The energy sector was the S&P 500's worst performer, falling 1.3%. U.S. crude for August delivery fell 4.1% to $45.13 a barrel to end an eight-session winning streak\u8212\'20\'14its longest since 2010. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-returns-to-bear-market-1498001993"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Oil entered into a bear market}}}\uc2  June 20 amid oversupply concerns, before prices {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-prices-mixed-amid-concerns-about-oversupply-1499080635"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rallied at the end of the month}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I've been a long-term believer of the view, 'Sell rallies in oil,'" said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management. "This is just another instance of that. The overall supply dynamic is still not solved," he said.\par \par \uc2 Falling oil prices helped support bonds and other haven assets, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  note falling to 2.334% from 2.352% Monday. Yields fall as prices rise.\par \par \uc2 Market reaction was muted to the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-ready-to-start-portfolio-wind-down-within-months-1499277737"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 minutes from its June meeting}}}\uc2 , which showed officials readying plans to start gradually shrinking the central bank's balance sheet in coming months. Some investors and analysts said the minutes weren't surprising after a number of global central banks struck a more hawkish tone last week.\par \par \uc2 "Markets seem to have an understanding of where the Fed's mind is today, and nothing has altered that path as of yet," said Mr. Thooft.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.2%.\par \par \uc2 Write to \uc2 Riva Gold\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:riva.gold@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 riva.gold@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-ready-to-start-portfolio-wind-down-within-months-1499277737?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Fed Officials Ready to Start Shrinking Portfolio in Months}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/07/05/second-quarter-winners-losers-in-the-u-s-stock-market/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Second-Quarter Winners & Losers}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-falls-in-low-volume-holiday-trading-1499251000?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Oil Falls Amid Global Glut Worries}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020170705ed750002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved \par \par \uc2 You think this market's crazy? One day in early 1987, with Wall Street humming, a meeting after trading closed involved several cases of champagne. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had breached 2000 that day, a cause for celebration. A week and a half later, more champagne was ordered when the average passed 2100. Then again a few weeks later for 2200. Eventually my boss stopped buying bubbly when breaking records became the norm. Japanese insurance companies would show up at the brokerage firm where I was a securities analyst and ask for a list of our five favorite stocks, then hand it to their salesman and say "buy 50,000 of each."\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, the average dropped 108 points. Rumors swirled that we'd celebrate with cases of Bud Light. No matter: I was with some traders and a client in a stretch limo, headed to watch Mike Tyson fight Tyrell Biggs for the heavyweight championship -- an event staged by Donald Trump in Atlantic City, N.J. Man, I miss the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 The market truly crashed the next Monday, dropping 508 points, or 22.6%. In retrospect, there had been signs all over the place. How did everyone miss them? Well, as the old Wall Street adage goes, no one rings a bell at the top (or bottom) of the market.\par \par \uc2 So here we are in 2017. The stock market is supposed to be the great humbler, but the records are coming fast and easy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 8% for the year and flirts with a record practically every day. Some of this is structural: Bonds are no fun, since the yield curve is flattening and three-month Treasurys are 1%. So money flows to stocks -- and other weird things.\par \par \uc2 A friend of mine used to run a large-growth mutual fund. In the dot-com mania of 1999, he told me that tens of millions of new capital would flow in every single day. Trying to figure out where to put it, he would consider the new batch of initial public offerings -- and then inevitably he just would buy more \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  or America Online or \uc2 Cisco\uc2  or, what the heck, \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  again.\par \par \uc2 Today, money is flowing into exchange-traded funds. But because ETFs are weighted by market cap, that money flows into the biggest names: \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , Apple,\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 . Classic momos, or momentum stocks. The church of what's working now. What could possibly go wrong?\par \par \uc2 Sure, the economy is picking up, earnings are growing, and the business is being transformed by mobile, cloud and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . But who doesn't already know that? On the flip side, we're at the start of a 30-year cycle of interest-rate raising, nonhousing debt is higher than in 2008, and deciphering China's direction is as hard as Chinese arithmetic.\par \par \uc2 Remember, bull markets end when the perception of earnings growth disappears, maybe because of a recession or even simply pending inflation. Manias, on the other hand, end when the market runs out of buyers.\par \par \uc2 In 1987, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker refused to support the dollar, and Japanese buyers left town. In late 1999, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan flooded the economy with money to head off a potential panic over the Y2K computer glitch. Then in early 2000 he pulled the money back in, ending the stock-buying frenzy. In 2007, the subprime mortgage-backed security market rolled over as foreign buyers left, though because of thinly traded markets it took another year to show up in prices.\par \par \uc2 Another ding-dong: In less than a year at least 50 companies, including one named Mysterium, have raised hundreds of millions of dollars via something called Initial Coin Offerings, selling a percentage of a new cryptocurrency service in exchange for other digital coins. That's a modern version of a blank-check company, which usually ends in tears.\par \par \uc2 So are we facing a raging bull market or a mania? Sadly, you'll only know in retrospect. I'm not saying it's a top today, though if it is, I'm happy to take credit. It could go on for a while.\par \par \uc2 Pundits pore over charts of volatility and put-call ratios. Forget that. Real investors survey the landscape and look for signs of a market gone loco. In one week in late 1999, the hedge fund I used to run had two groups from the Middle East each insist on wiring us $500 million. Practically "The Gong Show." We politely declined and then started returning money to our existing investors.\par \par \uc2 Are there any bells ringing now? How about a few months back when someone looked me in the eye and insisted -- without cracking a smile -- that Uber was a bargain at a $68 billion valuation? Or when, with shades of \uc2 AOL\uc2  and \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 , \uc2 Amazon\uc2  bought \uc2 Whole Foods\uc2  for $13 billion -- and then its stock went up by more than that amount?\par \par \uc2 Or when Tesla missed its numbers again and the stock rose anyway? Or when the price of a bitcoin, backed by nothing but the faith of devotees, hit $3,000, tripling over a year? Or when Hertz stock rose 14% on news of a deal with Apple for a self-driving car that is still vaporware?\par \par \uc2 Listen for whom the bell tolls.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kessler
