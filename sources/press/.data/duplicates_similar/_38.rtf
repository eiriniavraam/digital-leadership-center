Australia\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 REA Group\uc2  has set out to remedy this by enabling online buyers to obtain approval for a mortgage directly through its platform. The digital property marketplace launched the joint property search and mortgage broking service with \uc2 National Australia Bank\uc2  (NAB) in September. REA, which operates in Australia, the US and Asia, believes it is a world first.\par \par \uc2 Because the scheme involved handling detailed information, the mortgage approval tool had to be carefully built to comply with Australia\u8217\'20\'19s Privacy Act and financial regulations. REA\u8217\'20\'19s in-house counsel and lawyers at law firm Corrs Chambers Westgarth were therefore vital to its development.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a bunch of financial regulation that was drafted for banking a very long time ago,\u8221\'20\'1D says Sarah Turner, REA\u8217\'20\'19s general counsel. \u8220\'20\'1CYou need to be able to work within those parameters and you need to be able to work in a way that\u8217\'20\'19s best for the consumers and not for you or the bank.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 At both REA and Corrs, the lawyers\u8217\'20\'19 innovations were led by tech, which increasingly underpins legal expertise in Australia, one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most competitive legal markets.\par \par \uc2 Usually, REA and NAB use and treat data differently. \u8220\'20\'1CWe needed to mesh those ideas together to bring the experience to life,\u8221\'20\'1D says Ms Turner. \u8220\'20\'1CBut the end result is that we can provide a clear indication of what someone can afford as they search.\u8221\'20\'1D REA believes the new tool will disrupt traditional loans for residential property in Australia. As chief executive Tracey Fellows put it in November, \u8220\'20\'1Cthat decision of how much money you can borrow is so inextricably linked to finding your place [to live]\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Led by partner Justin Fox, Melbourne-based Corrs advised on and negotiated the relationship terms between REA and NAB. Corrs suggested a process-driven approach, whereby REA and NAB undertook the development work together and checked in at scheduled intervals.\par \par \uc2 The project pivoted and changed as the engineers, developers and user experience team worked together. \u8220\'20\'1CWe didn\u8217\'20\'19t draft an agreement and fit the work to it. Rather, as the work flexed, we followed iteratively,\u8221\'20\'1D says Ms Turner.\par \par \uc2 Construction conflict resolution\par \par \uc2 At MinterEllison, the Sydney-based law firm, an analytical tool helped to resolve a highly complex, very public dispute \u8212\'20\'14 in which claims totalled A$1.1bn \u8212\'20\'14 between the consortium behind the Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal (Wicet) development in Queensland and engineering firms Monadelphous Engineering and Muhibbah Construction. The conflict, under way for years before MinterEllison stepped in on behalf of Wicet, related to many and varied disputes connected with the costs of a 1.8km approach jetty and ship berth.\par \par \uc2 MinterEllison tasked a team of consultants \u8212\'20\'14 including forensic accountants, quantity surveyors, data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  specialists, time experts and legal process outsource providers \u8212\'20\'14 to build a tool that lawyers could use to assess contractor claims against its documents and data, coupled with Wicet\u8217\'20\'19s own information. It gave MinterEllison insight into where a contractor\u8217\'20\'19s 1,200 staff were at any single point in time along with information about what job they were doing. Queries could be used at a detailed level to detect duplicate claims over resources including workers, plant and equipment, or for example if a particular worker was said to be present in two places at once.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe disputes were able to be settled on acceptable financial terms to Wicet in a short time period after sharing the tool and some of its outputs with the contractor,\u8221\'20\'1D says Andrew Orford, a partner at MinterEllison.\par \par \uc2 Stock exchange\u8217\'20\'19s blockchain plans\par \par \uc2 New technologies such as blockchain, a distributed ledger used to track and record certain transactions, are being explored by some firms, as businesses start to harness the tech for use other than cryptocurrencies. such as bitcoin and ether.\par \par \uc2 Gilbert + Tobin worked with the \uc2 Australian Securities Exchange\uc2  (\uc2 ASX\uc2 ) on a blockchain project that will allow settlement and clearing transactions to be logged and recorded on a digital, decentralised, public ledger.\par \par \uc2 G+T advised on the legal and regulatory framework for the platform, which will replace \uc2 ASX\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System (Chess) with distributed ledger tech built by \uc2 Digital Asset Holdings\uc2 . G+T partner Simon Burns says his firm sees an opportunity to become one of the go-to law firms for blockchain. To develop its expertise, it has formed relationships with experts such as Taylor Gerring, co-founder of the Ethereum Foundation, which developed the ether cryptocurrency, as well as blockchain vendors such as \uc2 IBM\uc2  and R3.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe set out trying to develop our understanding of [blockchain] and then, on the back of that, develop our understanding of the potential legal implications and [related] things which flow from it,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Burns.\par \par \uc2 Explore the Innovative Lawyers Asia-Pacific rankings 2018\par \par \uc2 Overall\par \par \uc2 * Rule of law and access to justice \u8226\'20\'22 In-house\par \par \uc2 * Most Innovative Law Firms (International)\par \par \uc2 * Most Innovative Law Firms (Asia-Pacific)\par \par \uc2 * Most Innovative In-House Legal Teams\par \par \uc2 Business of Law\par \par \uc2 * Australia \u8226\'20\'22 In-house\par \par \uc2 * New business & service delivery models \u8226\'20\'22 In-house\par \par \uc2 * New products & services\par \par \uc2 * Talent, strategy and changing behaviours \u8226\'20\'22 In-house\par \par \uc2 * Technology \u8226\'20\'22 In-house\par \par \uc2 Legal Expertise\par \par \uc2 * Accessing new markets & capital\par \par \uc2 * Accessing new markets & capital (Asia-Pacific)\par \par \uc2 * Accessing new markets & capital (International)\par \par \uc2 * Australia \u8226\'20\'22 In-house\par \par \uc2 * Dispute resolution\par \par \uc2 * Driving value \u8226\'20\'22 In-house\par \par \uc2 * Enabling business growth \u8226\'20\'22 In-house\par \par \uc2 * Managing complexity & scale\par \par \uc2 * Managing complexity & scale (Asia-Pacific)\par \par \uc2 * Managing complexity & scale (International)\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180531ee5v00912\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

There is hence a need for a consolidated, efficient and accurate way to serve customers, banks and society,\u8221\'20\'1D the five banks said in a joint release.\par \par \uc2 Danske\uc2  was the most recent lender to find itself in the crosshairs of regulators with Denmark\u8217\'20\'19s Financial Supervisory Authority giving eight reprimands over weak anti-money laundering controls that gave rise to suspected \u8220\'20\'1Ccriminal activities involving vast amounts of money\u8221\'20\'1D flowing through its Estonian operations.\par \par \uc2 Nordea\uc2  and Handelsbanken had previously been fined by Swedish regulators for lax controls. Handelsbanken also faced sharp criticism recently from UK regulators for serious weaknesses in combating financial crime because of failings of senior management.\par \par \uc2 The five Nordic lenders said the focus would be on their biggest business customers initially, but bankers said it was possible to expand it to retail customers after that.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have been discussing for some time if there\u8217\'20\'19s a possibility to join forces and have some standardised processes,\u8221\'20\'1D one banker said, adding that customers were often frustrated when they wanted to swap banks and had to go through the same procedures again.\par \par \uc2 Money laundering concerns have been rising up banks\u8217\'20\'19 agendas after a series of fines of lenders including \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and as western politicians fret about financial flows from the likes of Russia and North Korea. Banks have turned to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to help them identify suspicious transactions.\par \par \uc2 But some have raised doubts about the efficacy of increased regulation. Rob Wainwright, the former head of the \uc2 EU\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s law enforcement agency \uc2 Europol\uc2 , said earlier this year that banks were spending $20bn on anti-money laundering compliance to seize just a tiny fraction of criminal assets. He added that 400 professional money launderers \u8220\'20\'1Cat the top, top level\u8221\'20\'1D were running billions of euros through the system \u8220\'20\'1Cwith a 99 per cent success rate\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The five banks\u8217\'20\'19 joint venture \u8212\'20\'14 to be known as Nordic KYC Utility \u8212\'20\'14 is due to start in the second half of this year if it gets approval from \uc2 EU\uc2  competition authorities. The new company will be able to offer its services to third parties as well as the five banks.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180531ee5v0028l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

What happens on the signaling pathways between them influences whether it leads to specific health conditions.\par \par \uc2 Working on that knowledge, Cambridge, Mass.-based Camp4 Therapeutics Corp. has developed a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  platform that codifies the biological mechanisms responsible for activating the 24,000 genes in the human body. By mapping this so-called gene circuitry code, Camp4 believes its platform can help researchers identify the specific set of signals that cause disease.\par \par \uc2 Now, with $30 million in fresh funding led by \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , Camp4 hopes to work with drugmakers targeting a wide range of diseases. \uc2 Polaris Venture Partners\uc2 , which seeded and formed the company, participated in the Series A round along with the \uc2 Kraft Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The gene circuitry code shows us how genes use a combination of signals to turn themselves up or down, which could cause disease," said Chief Executive Josh Mandel-Brehm.\par \par \uc2 He said Camp4 will run its own drug discovery programs and will own the intellectual property of each maps it creates.\par \par \uc2 Formed in 2015, Camp4's technology is based on genomics research by founders Dr. Richard Young and Dr. Leonard Zon. It was expertise of the founders that initially caught the interest of \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , said General Partner Jorge Conde. The deal marks the first investment since he joined the firm in September to co-manage its life-sciences fund with \uc2 Vijay Pande\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Imagine every gene has a unique lockbox that gets triggered by specific pathways firing," said Mr. Conde, who will join the company's board.

That effect is already being felt in online shopping, where prices have fallen by 3 per cent over the past two and a quarter years, Ms Meeker said, citing data from \uc2 Adobe\uc2 , compared with 1 per cent for offline goods.\par \par \uc2 US technology companies have also intensified their efforts to find the next big thing, investing an average of 18 per cent of their revenues on research and development and capital spending, up from 13 per cent a decade ago, Ms Meeker said.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 That is bringing companies such as\u160\'00\'A0Alphabet and\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Amazon\uc2  into closer competition with each other, in areas ranging from online advertising and shopping to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the cloud.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 Google\uc2  in effect is evolving from an ad product to a commerce platform,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms Meeker said. \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 Amazon\uc2  is evolving from a commerce platform to an\u160\'00\'A0 ad platform.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ms Meeker ended her presentation by imploring Silicon Valley executives to address the impact of their technologies, as their size and scale grows.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are living in a period of unprecedented change, unprecedented opportunity,\u8221\'20\'1D she said, \u8220\'20\'1Cand, especially for the people in this room, unprecedented need for responsibility.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180530ee5u008px\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Brexit was expected to blunt London hiring.\par \par \uc2 Manolo Falco, Citi's head of Europe, Middle East and Africa corporate and investment banking, said: "We had all of the top universities pre-crisis ... Now [our demand] is more varied. We're going broader in terms of the places where we source from."\par \par \uc2 Citi drew 60,761 applications for its corporate and investment banking programmes, up 12 per cent year on year. The candidates were vying for 520 jobs, down from the 575 offered a year earlier. Figures for Citi's markets division are not available.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche's candidates were applying for jobs across the bank, according to a person with knowledge of the hiring. The person said that Deutsche had hired 619 graduates last year, and "we expect that to increase this year too".\par \par \uc2 Deutsche has spent much of the past year in crisis, culminating in the chaotic replacement of its chief executive in April and the announcement of another round of cuts that will largely fall on the investment bank, a popular destination for graduates.\par \par \uc2 Its investment bank has been one of the most progressive in graduate hiring techniques, using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools to screen a broad pool of talent for those who are the best emotional and cognitive fit.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  attracted about 100,000 applications for about 1,000 places on its summer analyst programme for undergraduates and its summer associates programme for MBA students. The bank said applications were up 8 per cent year on year. \uc2 Barclays International\uc2  will hire 500 graduates this year, up from 450 in 2017. \uc2 UBS\uc2  said it had hired about 400 graduates so far this year, including 100 in the UK. Last year, \uc2 UBS\uc2  hired about 400 graduates, of which 70 were in the UK.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180530ee5u0006d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The officials\u8212\'20\'14Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Dallas Fed President \uc2 Robert Kaplan\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14discussed how disruptive innovations and technology may potentially influence the macroeconomy, and how central banks should conduct monetary policy. They also touched on the neutral rate of interest, bank regulation and unemployment, among other topics. David Altig, the Atlanta Fed's research director, moderated the conversation. Here is a transcript of the exchange, edited for length and clarity.\par \par \uc2 ROBERT S. KAPLAN\uc2 : Well, I'm going to be very brief, and I'm actually just going to make one or two points that I think come from this conference.\par \par \uc2 And I'll start first with the basics. (Gross domestic product) growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in productivity. We don't even talk about workforce growth, but we know because of aging demographics in the United States that workforce growth is going to be sluggish in the years ahead, and we can talk more about that in the Q&A. My concern is about productivity growth and the impact of disruption on productivity growth. Or, put another way, as the panel we just heard discussing, why has productivity growth been sluggish?\par \par \uc2 And I think from this conference there are a couple of thoughts that I think I had before but have crystalized a little bit (during) the panels yesterday and today. And I've said this before: If the workforce of the United States is approximately 160 million workers, plus or minus, and 46 million of those 160 million workers have a high school education or less \u8211\'20\'13 I think studies have shown that if you're more highly educated you're more adaptable to technology-enabled disruption; and if you have lower levels of educational attainment, you know, your participation rate and your employment rate is going to be lower.\par \par \uc2 And I think the thing that strikes me as our system, our \u8211\'20\'13 we have a very rapidly-evolving private sector, business sector that is, where there are very few constraints, you can reorganize your company. I taught leadership for a living and we used to talk about design factors of organizations. And in the private sector \u8211\'20\'13 and I've learned this from experience \u8211\'20\'13 with enough determination and money, you can redesign and change just about any design factor you want.\par \par \uc2 And when I went to Harvard I learned, you know, there are certain design factors you are not going to change. Tenure is an example \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 unless you're a university president who would like to get yourself killed. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 And so I think what I'm learning over the last couple of days, we've got a private sector that's innovating and moving at accelerating speed, fueled by all sorts of (\b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 ) and other tools. And we've talked about cloud, et cetera. And then we've got an education sector \u8211\'20\'13 high school, maybe even secondary education \u8211\'20\'13 high school, just there \u8211\'20\'13 that have deeply embedded design factors. Local school boards, those in Texas know some of the challenges here. Local school boards, unions, work rules, other impediments. Junior colleges, which we saw a couple of examples yesterday of two that are a little more adaptable. And then colleges. But we're seeing our education system in the United States has deeply embedded design factors, probably needs to restructure to keep up with this accelerating innovation, and we're not really set up to do it. And it's not that there's a lack of leadership; it's it would take an unusual leader to be able to change some of these very deeply embedded design factors.\par \par \uc2 So what leaders in those sectors do is work around the embedded design factors and do the best they can. And I think we saw three leaders yesterday on the junior college and Paul Quinn College that are three leaders that are saying there's embedded design factors, but we're going to, to the extent possible, work around those. And including (Paul Quinn College President) Michael Sorrell, who basically said we're opting out of some of the national accreditation rules so that we can opt out of these to meet this problem.\par \par \uc2 And I think I'll just stop there. I think this issue is going to magnify in the years ahead, because everything I'm learning in this conference and I've learned before is innovation is going to accelerate, and the rate of acceleration \u8211\'20\'13 the second derivative \u8211\'20\'13 that's what's changed. You know, we've had this \u8211\'20\'13 you know, people being replaced by technology \u8211\'20\'13 for decades. But the rate \u8211\'20\'13 the second derivative, the rate, is what's changing. And I will say as a businessperson I've never seen this rate change in my business career. I'll just speak as a businessperson. Certainly, for those who watch the economy, I think that must also be true. And I think the big challenge leaving here is what can nonprofits do, what can business leaders do, and what can the public \u8211\'20\'13 what can we do as citizens \u8211\'20\'13 is there a way for monetary policy to address some of these embedded design factors in our education system so that we can move faster to keep up with this?\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, at the Fed, for me the implications are I think \u8211\'20\'13 I would think pricing power of businesses are going to continue to be limited. Inflationary pressures may be more muted at different levels of employment than we're used to historically. I think the (inaudible) efforts of each of the Federal Reserve banks have never been more important, you know, to try to highlight the research and address these issues. And I think from a monetary policy point of view I think these structural factors, at least for me, will play more highly in my thinking in the months and years ahead as we go through the path of trying to normalize monetary policy in the United States.\par \par \uc2 So that's really \u8211\'20\'13 that's all the comments I want to make, and I'll stop there.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: So what I thought I'd do is really start just by thinking about this from the larger context. So this notion of disruption and technology-enabled change is not something that the Fed has tools to address. This is something that is happening in education and affordable housing and workforce development and small business development and entrepreneurship. These are all very important sectors, but they're not sectors that our tools are really designed to engage in a very specific way. And yet, this is the second conference that I've been in in a month where we've been talking about this.\par \par \uc2 And I think it really highlights the importance of this issue from a broader macroeconomic perspective because, as Rob said yesterday, the scope of this is broad and the speed of transformation is quite high. So, you know, I think it's really important that at the Fed we talk about these things because it has real implications for what success will look like in the pursuit of our mandate of maximum sustainable employment. So I'm really, really glad that we're doing this.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the policy, I think that the biggest outgrowth of this is that it makes our job harder. There is just a lot of uncertainty, and in many ways we're in a period of transition where we don't really know what the relationships are likely to be. And there's some likelihood that tomorrow's relationships will look very different than the relationships from the past few decades, and so \u8211\'20\'13 whether you think about productivity, which Rob talked about; whether you think about labor markets and workforce, which you spent a fair amount of time talking about yesterday.\par \par \uc2 On the labor force point, I would just say that one thing I think is really important that we need to get our heads around is, how do we train people to be elastic thinkers and to be maximally adaptive? Because the world is changing faster, and those who will be most effective are going to be the ones who can adapt the most readily and the most quickly to a new environment. And we'll need to do that. And, you know, this really has to do with the speed of change that's happening.\par \par \uc2 One of our board members \u8211\'20\'13 I guess it was \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 conference \u8211\'20\'13 and he looked at the chart, and he said the ability of humans to adapt and the ability of technology to change. And his conjecture was that we have crossed the \u8211\'20\'13 we're past the cross point where computers can change \u8211\'20\'13 technology can change faster than people can adapt. And we have to \u8211\'20\'13 I think it's a major question of what that means for how we approach our engagement in the marketplace and how we think about change in a market perspective.\par \par \uc2 I just wanted to point to two other things that I think are important issues that I haven't heard raised as much today or really the course of the conference. One is around market structure and pricing. So I am really starting to wonder whether our notions of how prices get set are changing fundamentally. When I think about retail \u8211\'20\'13 and when I \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 everyone has Amazon Prime, right? Everyone has Amazon Prime. (Laughter.) And when you go to buy something in a store, you always check the Amazon price before you will actually be willing to buy it. This means that Amazon is now the price setter, right? But Amazon doesn't make any of these goods, right? And so now there's a potential for a disconnect between the actual cost of production and margin and what the market price looks like. And to the extent that there is a wedge, now our markets are going to operate in a different way. And I think it's something that we should be thinking about and trying to understand the extent to which this is happening. It has real implications for what inflation looks like and how we measure changes in the economy, and pretty significantly.\par \par \uc2 A second area that I've been thinking about is around consumer confidence. So when I talk to \u8211\'20\'13 before, in my previous life, when I would talk about the economy, I'd say one thing you guys should track is consumer confidence, right? What's in the head of the consumer, of regular households? That's going to determine what they're going to be willing to spend on the big-ticket items, or will they pass it up. And in recent years we've seen a divergence between measures of consumer confidence and then what consumers are actually spending on, and the amount of spending. And that also has implications for how we think about the economy and economic performance. And, you know, I wonder to what extent the rapid pace of change is creating uncertainty for households at a \u8211\'20\'13 at sort of a meta level that is causing them to be more cautious and more restrained in their spending even when they're optimistic because they know that there's a lot of change. And that also has a big implication for how our policy \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 For me, I think the big question is, you know, how are we going to get answers to these questions? You know, we have the \u8211\'20\'13 those sources of data, but no one in here seems to be happy with them. So we're going to have to look to other things.\par \par \uc2 One is research. So the more people that we get studying this and trying to understand this, the more likely we'll get to see a little sooner as to what's really happening.\par \par \uc2 But the second is really to try to just talk to people. So one thing I've been very pleased that we have in our system is in our regional executive network we pay people to just go talk to CEOs. And I know what they're seeing, what their challenges are, how the world is changing for them because, you know \u8211\'20\'13 you know, it takes time \u8211\'20\'13 it takes time for these technologies to really get their traction. We want to find out when that traction's happening as soon as possible. And I'm relatively \u8211\'20\'13 I'm pretty confident that there will be people that see it before it shows up in any aggregate data. And so if we can get on that earlier, I think that can really help us make sure our policies are done in a timely fashion.\par \par \uc2 CHARLES L. EVANS\uc2 : All right, I'm going to do something different here.\par \par \uc2 So I want to thank Rob and Raphael for putting together really a tremendous conference here, and also the one a month ago in Florida that \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 and Raphael put together. You know, what we know about \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , technology and development is going to be unbelievably important, and there are a lot of big, big thoughts that have been expressed here that we need to get our heads around.\par \par \uc2 I'd say that the Fed's job is really hard or it certainly seems very hard when most of our data and statistics are somewhat antiquated. Or at least from Marty Feldstein's comments yesterday, if you want to think about how to measure productivity, gosh, that's really, really hard. And I think he almost used language to suggest it was hopeless \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 to get there. There are implications for what GDP measurement should be there, and incomes, and whether or not people's incomes are actually higher than they really think. So these are big problems, big issues.\par \par \uc2 I'm going to think much more small-ly today. These are going to be small thoughts for how monetary policy \u8211\'20\'13 and let me just say \u8211\'20\'13 before I begin, let me remind you that my comments today are my own, not those of the (Federal Open Market Committee).\par \par \uc2 This session is about how disruptive innovations and technology may potentially influence the macroeconomy, and then in response how central banks should conduct monetary policy, or at least that's how I'm approaching this. And we've heard at this conference advances in technologies that are big news and have important implications for almost every sector of the economy. And for economists, they provide lots of opportunities and lots of challenges.\par \par \uc2 First, let's consider the opportunities. Researchers now have access to massive amounts of new data and better computing power. I was really struck by that Cray computer \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 back to graduate school I wanted a grant that would give me time on that Cray computer, and \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 just incredible. (Laughter.) This is really cool stuff, and my staff and me, you know, we're fact-finders, data users. And so, you know, we really look forward to knowing more about this. These tools are great for basic economic research, especially for the work of microeconomists.\par \par \uc2 But there's lots of scope for macroeconomists as well. Some of these data may help us more precisely identify key policy making parameters, for example how consumer spending and business spending respond to tax changes. They may also help improve our ability to forecast short-term movements in the economy. In particular, we could see some exciting new indicators of the business cycle derived from new sources of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Even though there may be limits to what we can learn from \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , at least for a while, and at the \uc2 Atlanta Fed\uc2  conference (Fed Vice Chairman Randal) Quarles made a comment that said even though we've got a lot of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , we only have so many business cycles over a recent period of time. So at some point there's still a smallness of data. There just haven't been a lot of business cycles, and each has their own idiosyncratic features. Also, \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  weren't available during past business cycles, so deep data cross-cycle comparisons would not be easy \u8211\'20\'13 might not be impossible, but wouldn't be easy. Basically, we're stuck with this situation.\par \par \uc2 But this conference is less about the use of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and more about the consequences of large-scale technological innovation, so let me discuss some of those challenges. Such innovation could create challenges for monetary policy makers if it leads to hard-to-identify changes in the structure of macroeconomic relationships that might influence the business cycle. And in the end, that's what we monetary policy folks are concerned about, the business cycle.\par \par \uc2 The potential structural changes that come with innovation can affect the evolution of inflation and employment. As such, they may have implications for the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. For instance, these changes could generate headwinds for inflation that mean we might need to provide more accommodation to reach our inflation target than we have in the past. But, frankly, we don't know that. Perhaps these forces will lead to higher inflationary pressures that policy might have to counteract. There's a lot that no one really understands yet about this.\par \par \uc2 Of course, making policy in the presence of uncertainty and a changing economy is nothing new. We've dealt with plenty of structural changes before. History offers numerous examples. Let me just quote (former Fed) Chairman Alan Greenspan back in 1998, as he was grappling with this issue 20 years ago and he considered the possibility of a new economy. Let me quote him: "There is no question that events are continually altering the shape and nature of our economic processes, especially the extent to which technological breakthroughs have advanced and perhaps, most recently, even accelerated the pace of conceptualization of our gross domestic product. We have dramatically reduced the size of our radios, for example, by substituting transistors for vacuum tubes. Thin fiber-optic cable has replaced huge tonnages of copper wire. New architectural, engineering, and materials technologies have enabled the construction of buildings enclosing the same space but with far less physical material than was required, say, 50 or 100 years ago. Most recently, mobile phones have been markedly downsized as they have been improved. As a consequence, the physical weight of our GDP is growing only very gradually." (Laughter.) "The exploitation of new concepts accounts for virtually all of the inflation-adjusted growth in output." I seem to recall a catchier description of this when he said GDP is getting lighter. (Laughter.) I think The Economist may have \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). At any rate, technological change has been going on for quite some time and central bankers have had to try to understand that as best they can.\par \par \uc2 We don't know how various innovations will ultimately play out, how they'll affect the economy. The only slide I have here is to sort of describe the Fed's objective the way that I like to. I call this the full-sized slide \u8211\'20\'13 full-sized slide, which charts inflation against the unemployment rate. And it's got an estimate \u8211\'20\'13 an assessment of the natural rate of employment there and also our 2 percent inflation objective. And that's a bull's eye that you'd like to get right in the crosshairs there. Our job is to provide monetary and financial conditions to support the attainment of maximum employment and price stability.\par \par \uc2 Figuring out the effects of these developments is complicated. The size, magnitude, and timing of their impact are all uncertain. Technological advances can lead to conflicting effects. For instance, internet commerce may make markets more competitive. This might lead to lower prices and push inflation lower in the short run. But it may also allow companies to price-discriminate better, making markets less competitive and leading to higher average prices.\par \par \uc2 These new technologies can affect the natural rate of unemployment, too. Online job boards and other technology may be improving matching efficiently \u8211\'20\'13 efficiency. If so, the natural rate of unemployment will be lower. But these new technologies can also cause the natural rate to rise. This would happen, for example, if people became more specialized and labor markets become less fluid as a result.\par \par \uc2 So the really important feature is we need to have some assessment of what the sustainable rate of unemployment is. We recognize that it can change over time and some of these technologies could move it to a lower or a higher rate. That's one of the uncertainties that we currently face in policy making.\par \par \uc2 But we have to sort of say there's a lot of uncertainty we don't really know where it is. And the nice thing about the dual mandate is it reminds us, like, well, let's look for inflationary pressures, which most central banks around the world emphasize also, and take into account all of those things as we try to decide the best policy.\par \par \uc2 We've struggled to understand the effects of changing natural rates before. In the 1990s there were indications that the rise of labor market intermediaries, such as temporary-help firms, was lowering the natural rate. And in 2010 an increase in vacancy measures without a drop in unemployment led some to conclude the natural rate had risen.\par \par \uc2 Dynamic issues related to innovation might also cause difficulties for policy makers because some effects might be different in the short run and in the long run. Technological change also poses important challenges for the standard statistical measure of prices. Monetary policy relies on the economic relationships between the tools we control \u8211\'20\'13 for example, the short-term interest rate \u8211\'20\'13 and our policy objectives. Technological innovation may be changing these relationships. For instance, it must be much easier for firms to change online prices than it is for them to change prices in a physical store. That might make prices in the overall economy less sticky, which could change the parameters of the Phillips curve relationship that's important to much of monetary policy analysis. But this is pure conjecture at this stage.\par \par \uc2 What we need is really to focus on output-based monetary policy so that we can hit our objectives as best we can. I think that the changes in the way the data are collected could be helpful for us to understand these things better, more quickly, but at some root level we need to have some confidence that we're achieving our inflation and economic goals.\par \par \uc2 So I think I'll stop there. But I say these are smaller ideas because the focus is back to a small number of objectives. And even though things are changing very quickly and past (Fed) chairs like Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen always had to assess these things, at some point we have to adjust monetary policy in order to achieve these goals. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 DAVID E. ALTIG: All right. So I think each of you mentioned, essentially, the issue of heightened uncertainty. I counted up roughly 320 maybes/mights. (Laughter.) So, I mean, and you don't have the luxury of actually waiting for these uncertainties to resolve themselves, I mean, in your day jobs. So what is your thinking about what \u8211\'20\'13 when you kind of very directly look at the implications for monetary policy? I mean, would you need to be less aggressive, more aggressive? What do you think? Rob will start.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: So I'll start. So, for me, that is one of the nice things I'll say about \u8211\'20\'13 this is as a person who's been at the Fed now for, you know, two-and-three-quarters years \u8211\'20\'13 we've got 12 banks that are independently doing research and \u8211\'20\'13 I'm a little biased because I work at the Fed \u8211\'20\'13 pretty terrific bank presidents and board of governors that are each using analysis to get their views. But for me, the way this all washes out is it tells me that, number one, I'm going to want to be \u8211\'20\'13 in normalizing rates, I want to be attuned to the fact that the situation can change and my \u8211\'20\'13 our analysis can change pretty dramatically. Demographic trends may not change, but financial trends can change very quickly in a world that's much more interconnected.\par \par \uc2 And the fact that we acknowledge \u8211\'20\'13 which I think is a good thing \u8211\'20\'13 that we don't understand certain things, all that says to me is let's move gradually. (inaudible) may have a point. I personally \u8211\'20\'13 I advocate what I think that we should be moving toward normal. But I think we should do it gradually. And the reason for that is I'm sensitive to the fact we've got this recent stimulus. That's change. And maybe that this year's growth is going to in hindsight turn out to be a little bit not artificially inflated, but our growth is highly stimulated. And we may have out-year growth much weaker due to demographics and some of these other trends, like productivity. That's a reason to grow gradually.\par \par \uc2 And another reason to grow gradually is while we've got all this rapid change, we have one sector that is now very highly leveraged. And that's the government sector. At the federal level and to some extent at the state level, because \u8211\'20\'13 not solely because of the debt at the state level because of loss of population and very heavy pension and forward obligations. So that sector can't be that adaptable at all and that we've got this big weight we're carrying, which I think can transmit into unexpected changes in the financial sector, whether that's the treasury curve or financial markets. And I'm very attuned that things can change very, very quickly.\par \par \uc2 So that \u8211\'20\'13 for me, it means do your analysis in every meeting. Make your best judgments. Listen to the others around the FOMC table, which I do. Share information. And then let's move gradually and patiently and realizing that I think there's going to \u8211\'20\'13 there is more uncertainty. And I think that's the way to manage it, is to be open-minded, not predetermined, not rigid in our thinking. But the key is, again \u8211\'20\'13 open to learning I think is the most important criteria that I could have in my job, for my team to have, and I think that the FOMC to have.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: (Inaudible.) (Laughter.) Yeah. You asked me something about being more aggressive or less aggressive. I just don't think about it like that. I think about we need to be \u8211\'20\'13 I think we need to be more willing to change. And be willing to be informed by new information that comes in, because that new information can be \u8211\'20\'13 in today's world, looks very different than what we have had before. And it suggests very different things are happening in the economy. And so, for me, I think we need to be nimble in our thinking and sort of have more heightened sensitivity to the quality of our information gathering in real time, so that \u8211\'20\'13 so that if we do get that information to make the most important decision possible.\par \par \uc2 Now, there are a host of reasons why I think we need to improve it gradually, not the least of which that we've told people that's what we're going to do. (Laughter.) And so, you know, we don't want our policy \u8211\'20\'13 I don't think \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 back and forth and surprising people. And absent some really, really big information, I think we're in a position where we can continue to do that without a lot of costs. So to me, I think is we've got to be willing to have our world view change as information comes in.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: Charles?\par \par \uc2 MR. EVANS: Oh, I agree with all of that. I do think \u8211\'20\'13 you know, there have been some very important instances, I think, in the last 20 years where the FOMC has had to stop and ponder this. I think the example that I \u8211\'20\'13 that Chairman Greenspan, when he was thinking about new technologies and, you know, that was back in the \u8211\'20\'13 you know, '96-'97. And he talked about, oh, the stock market's really high. How do you know if it's irrational exuberance? Maybe we should be concerned about that. Before long he started saying: You know, the analysts' forward expectations of earnings, cycle-adjusted, are higher than I've ever seen before. Does that tell me that productivity might be stronger? Also, that the valuations of the stock market would be more fundamental, and it may struggle with that?\par \par \uc2 The answer that the committee came to was, let's go slow, and didn't raise rates at that point. And I think that that worked out really quite well. I'd say in the mid-2000s, with \u8211\'20\'13 after the 2004 rate increase began, and it was a pace that was likely to be measured. And then you go about a year, and then you realize 10-year rates are not really going up as much as I would have thought. What's going on? Greenspan had this conundrum. Governor Bernanke said there's a flow of capital into the U.S. that seems unusual. We need to stop and think about that. The answer was continuing with measured pace.\par \par \uc2 So one answer seems to be, well, go slow, be careful. But it's not just in the instrument space, if you will, but it's really the outcome space. And so if you sort of just take a contrarian viewpoint, which is not necessarily mine at the moment, but you could go caution ought to be we don't move too far away from the bull's eye. If we think that unemployment is low, close to maximum employment, there could be risks if we go lower because on the swing back usually bad things have happened, that's an argument for maybe adjusting policy so that the outcomes don't change that much. I think we have to think through all of these, as the committee does. And so, you know, trying to read the empirical news is very important.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: OK, the program promises that the question of whether or not the current monetary policy framework is adequate to the circumstances will be answered. (Laughter.) So is the current monetary framework adequate to the circumstances?\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: (Inaudible.) So, listen, I come from the \u8211\'20\'13 A, the business world. And I was professor of leadership. So I don't know what that means exactly \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 but I have a view on a few things like this. And here's what I \u8211\'20\'13 and seriously, from my career before the Fed, it was always my view that successful organizations \u8211\'20\'13 whether they're in the for-profit, government sector, nonprofit sector \u8211\'20\'13 one of the things they have in common is they are, again, open to learning and they tend to step back on some regular basis, whether that's every year, every three years, every four years, and rethink their targets, their frameworks, their governance, and ask fundamental questions. And I come from a place where I think that's a healthy thing to do.\par \par \uc2 And I think for a public institution, it's not only a healthy thing to do, but it's a healthy thing to be seen to do that. And so I think there are aspects of our framework \u8211\'20\'13 and I know there's been the discussion about either inflation targeting not \u8211\'20\'13 slash nominal GDP targeting, which we've done a lot of work on here, and other formats. I think all those questions are healthy. And I think we ought to create the space at the Fed on some regular basis \u8211\'20\'13 I don't know what the interval is \u8211\'20\'13 where we step back, and we re-debate it, and we get outside views, and we ponder it.\par \par \uc2 And I think it would be healthy to do that outside our regular meeting schedule. And so I'm more interested not in whether we've \u8211\'20\'13 what we've decided the framework is or is not at any time. I'm much more focused on if we have a good process. And for me, that means we ought to have a space outside our own meeting schedule to step back and debate these views and get outside views, outside criticism, and the world see us as open to hearing that and processing it, and adjusting if we decide a new course.\par \par \uc2 Other central banks in the world \u8211\'20\'13 I know Canada does this, the U.K. does this. And I think those \u8211\'20\'13 we may not want to adopt exactly the way they do it, but I think it's instructive and I think we would be well-served to do that also.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: So I agree. When I started I was struck by the fact that we hadn't hit our inflation target for, what was it, five years? Six years? Nine years? Whatever it had been. (Laughter.) Some high number. And it \u8211\'20\'13 the lack of hitting the target corresponded with our adoption of the current framework. Now, that could be coincidence. But it also might not be. And so I think \u8211\'20\'13 just like Rob \u8211\'20\'13 I think we should always be evaluating, assessing the performance of the approaches that we're taking in getting us to the outcomes that we'd like to have. So, you know, we just posted, I guess, a couple weeks ago, a four-point \u8211\'20\'13 a four-point blog series on price level targeting as a potential framework that should be considered. And talked about some of the pros and the cons associated with that, just to start the debate.\par \par \uc2 I actually think that \u8211\'20\'13 I agree with Rob that we should be as transparent as possible in how we're approaching decision-making, so that \u8211\'20\'13 so the Fed is not a mysterious institution, but rather an institution where people have confidence that we're deliberating and we're \u8211\'20\'13 in this space we're thoughtful and it's not just a cabal; there's real thought that's happening. And I think it will serve us well moving forward. So I look forward to those conversations as well, hope that we have them. I'm not sure that we've had too many at your meetings \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 but I'm happy to have that engagement.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: Charles.\par \par \uc2 MR. EVANS: This is a fascinating topic. And it sort of gets at the heart of central banking, because central bankers, kind of by and large, are a very conservative lot. And we go back. I mean, there's a tremendous premium placed on consistency of how you've done it over decades or centuries. So just think about the classical gold standard and whether or not you would have periodically, every five years, thought about, well, maybe we should adjust the \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). (Laughter.) Unheard of, right? (Laughter.) I mean, or, you know, Winston Churchill was the (Chancellor of the Exchequer) who decided to take, you know, Britain back to the pre-World War I parity in the 1920s. And that was a very challenging decision for Britain during that time. So the stability of objectives and the way of doing it sort of goes with the territory.\par \par \uc2 And yet, we get brought into changes. The economy is changing. And do we have the tools to address low inflation over a long period of time? I'm extraordinarily sympathetic to Raphael's comment about we had a hard time hitting our inflation objective just at the time we said 2 percent \u8211\'20\'13 2 percent is what we would like. But of course, it was a very difficult economic environment. I interpret the most recent discussion about, you know, listening to alternative monetary frameworks is a healthy discussion for economists, central bankers. But I think we need to engage the public and try to decide what communications are going to be required.\par \par \uc2 I made some comments in New York several months ago where I tried to sort of say: If you think about all these frameworks, one way or another they're kind of geared towards the moment when we need more accommodation and we might be hitting the zero lower bound, we're going to come up with a good justification for why we're going to be very aggressive in continuing with accommodation in order to get inflation up to where we are. In fact, so much so that with price level targeting or temporary price level targeting or nominal GDP targeting, we can experience it during the time where inflation will likely be, like, 4 percent or more, because of an opening up of a price gap that hasn't been closed. And so to close it, if 2 percent is the unconditional price line, we might have 4 percent or 6 percent. How will the public respond to that? Oh, it's just price level targeting. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 But, you know, following that, I gave speeches in 2010 where I tried to talk about the benefits of temporary price level targeting that Ben Bernanke has recently been talking about. One of the criticisms I got there is that the public does not understand the price line. They understand inflation, but they don't understand the price line. Now, seven years later, eh, we think enough people understand this. I think we will need to assess with the public what they can actually digest, but in the meantime we should probably work very carefully within \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 if we continue with our current framework, how do we make sure that we can hit our goals of full employment and the 2 percent inflation rate on average over a long period of time? There's a lot to talk about there.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: OK. I'm going to ask one more question and then we'll turn it to the audience. If I heard you correctly, Raphael, and I think I heard Charlie kind of allude to this as well, suggested that maybe the sort of disruptive technologies we're experiencing may be making markets less competitive instead of being more competitive. Did I interpret you correctly?\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: I think I can say that that may be the case.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: Yes. And so is there general agreement on the panel about that, or? I wouldn't have asked this question if I thought that \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). (Laughs.)\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: So I'll make the case, and then you can tell me why I'm wrong. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 I do think that in today's environment in many of \u8211\'20\'13 the way the economy is evolving there is a tendency for the winner to take most of the market. And to the extent that you have large power accruing to a small number of players, they then have the ability to either deny the disruptive alternatives or exercise that market power in ways that could ultimately be detrimental to consumers. Now, sometimes in the acquisition of that power companies may choose not to exercise it fully. So I think that with Amazon they have a tremendous reach. They have been pricing it relatively benignly, but it does increase by 20 percent. And no one's really going to go after Amazon. I don't think anyone is disrupting Amazon. And so to me, that's a sign that there is a significant power that's being accrued. And to the extent this is happening in a series of segments of the marketplace, that could mean we would end up with a much less competitive environment than we have had in historic periods.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: Rob.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: So I think all that makes sense. I guess I would say \u8211\'20\'13 and I talked about scale when I first kicked off the conference, and that companies were responding by getting more scale. And I agree with Raphael, if you are early and if you are able to scale some of these big platform companies, there's no question that they've got \u8211\'20\'13 you know, you mentioned Amazon, we've mentioned \uc2 Google\uc2 . And we could probably get four or five other platform examples where they've got so much scale now that I don't know what you would call that, but you'd probably call it \u8211\'20\'13 you know, our \u8211\'20\'13 you'd call it a monopoly or enormous market cap. So if you're not them, it's not that the world isn't far more competitive for you. It's just you're now trying to figure out how to make your product more distinctive or fill out a niche, and then get more scale yourself to survive.\par \par \uc2 And so to the extent \u8211\'20\'13 with Raphael saying that the enormous scale some of these platform companies have built makes them \u8211\'20\'13 and, by the way, the market is rewarding them for selling goods sometimes at zero gross margin, which they have so much scale they can pick loss leaders. If you're competing with them \u8211\'20\'13 so for them \u8211\'20\'13 and if you look at the whole you'd say the country, the economy is less competitive. If you're one of the competitors who has to compete with them, you'd say the world is now hypercompetitive \u8211\'20\'13 I mean, brutally competitive in such a way that, you know, we're struggling as to how to maintain our margins. And I would say there's some pretty healthy companies out there for the first time in my career now are actively worrying \u8211\'20\'13 even though you wouldn't think \u8211\'20\'13 about survival. You know, survival is much more typical topic.\par \par \uc2 So I'd say \u8211\'20\'13 I agree that maybe that that's creating enormous barriers. But for everybody else, the world is so competitive now. And then the second is if you're in the labor force, you are on the receiving end of this unless you are very skilled or extremely, you know, educated enough to be adaptable to this. So I don't know whether you'd say \u8211\'20\'13 it's not that it's more or less competitive. It's just we're just describing the characteristics now of this economy. And it's created a lot of challenges. So I agree with those aspects of what Raphael said.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: Do you want to add anything, Charlie?\par \par \uc2 MR. EVANS: Well, I think Rob and Raphael well described how complicated the current situation is, and what workers are facing, what consumers are facing. There's lots of opportunity. There are lots of goods and services out there. And the state of competition is something I can't really characterize very well. I, you know, ultimately think that there's a tremendous amount of competition. And yet, I kind of worry that \u8211\'20\'13 you know, it's going to depend on the legal system. It's going to depend on what types of contracts are allowed. Just take patents, right?\par \par \uc2 The patents I think of, you know, pharmaceutical companies that make enormous investments in life-saving drugs. And they need to be compensated for the risks that they take, because not all of this works out. Quite the opposite. And so they're given patent protection for a period of time. Then generics come in, and then they offer tremendous benefits. And yet, for the first panel yesterday I was extremely impressed. I'm always reminded that CEOs, businesses, are extremely good at what they do. They're out to maximize profits, shareholder value. That's what they do. That's what we should expect them to do.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to public policy though, that's not necessarily aligned with what they care about, right? So in pharmaceuticals, you know, sometimes you get your patent extended and generics take longer to come online and, you know, that's more payment for past investments and consumers are going to pay more. I don't know what the right answer to that is. Ex ante you would like that to be decided as opposed to \u8211\'20\'13 as opposed to discretionary changes. And so I don't know what right blend is. In an environment where we have good confidence in the proper regulations and rule of law being applied with antitrust, then I would be not too concerned about this \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 or more of that.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: I mentioned \u8211\'20\'13 one last comment, then I'll \u8211\'20\'13 just take 60 seconds. I used to teach a class at Harvard called leadership and corporate accountability, which was intended to be part of the school \u8211\'20\'13 the little bit of ethics, broader topics for leaders for our companies. And one of the topics we talked about \u8211\'20\'13 and, again, this is going back \u8211\'20\'13 now I've been here three years, so four or five years ago \u8211\'20\'13 was the issue of our time is that the role of the CEO is to think \u8211\'20\'13 ideally, is to think more broadly than just about his or her company, but to think about the, quote-unquote, "externalities," the impact of what you're doing on the country. And that the country and the citizenry is hoping that business leaders will take this on.\par \par \uc2 I guess if I said that four years ago, roll forward to today, multiply it by 10. And that disruption is, as we said, it's creating more wealth inequality, and it's having \u8211\'20\'13 if you're employed at a place that works for you, great. But the impact on the externalities \u8211\'20\'13 educational quality for high schools, colleges, junior colleges, what happens to workers who are no longer working for you, I think \u8211\'20\'13 I still think the policy issue for business leaders of our time is how broadly do you need to think about your job. And I thought that panel we had to start this \u8211\'20\'13 for me, what I was thinking about while they were talking is, you know, I think that the challenge for society is I think business leaders are going to in the future \u8211\'20\'13 and I've said in this publicly \u8211\'20\'13 are going to have to think more broadly about the externalities. I mean, outside their company the impact of what they're doing. And I think society may demand that more.\par \par \uc2 This is not a monetary policy issue, by the way. This is just a \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: No, but I go two ways on this. So, one, yes, so as we get more consolidation, we have fewer company towns, you have fewer \u8211\'20\'13 you have corporations that see an obvious link between their survival and community survival. But then you \u8211\'20\'13 then we were just talking about how every company is learning to \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 at all, right? And to the extent they got to do that, then they need to preserve all of their resources just to be internally looking. And so it's an inseparable question.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: It's a question.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: Exactly.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: That's why I mentioned it's an enormous challenge. And it's made more difficult by the fact that, as I said, government \u8211\'20\'13 you heard Marty Feldstein last night. Government debt-to-GDP, I don't need to tell you, is \u8211\'20\'13 the path is likely unsustainable. States are having their own struggles. So who actually has the financial resources in this country? Businesses, to some extent nonprofits that are created. I think \u8211\'20\'13 I don't have an answer, but this is an enormous tension that \u8211\'20\'13 I agree with you \u8211\'20\'13 that had the job of the CEO, by the way, with activists and this pressure is getting tougher.\par \par \uc2 And their time frames, I would argue, are probably getting shorter. I thought we were short-term oriented 10 years ago. Man, and I was a \u8211\'20\'13 I was a defense \u8211\'20\'13 I was an anti-raid specialist. You know, the number of activists today. So these are big challenges. And I \u8211\'20\'13 the reason I mention them all, as we sit here at the FOMC we're trying to make good decisions for an ecosystem where all of these things are going on. And it's getting \u8211\'20\'13 it's getting much more complex. And the impact on human beings and on leaders across the system is getting more challenging, I think.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: And I do also want to piggyback on what Charlie was saying about the legal system. I don't think our legal system is \u8211\'20\'13 has evolved with the way business has evolved. (Laughter.) Maybe I'm blind, but I think \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: So let me ask a different question. Is \uc2 Facebook\uc2  a monopoly?\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: I don't really think \uc2 Facebook\uc2  is a monopoly. So these are \u8211\'20\'13 like, these are important questions, right, because it has implications for a scope of activity, for protections for consumers, for allowing other businesses to evolve and grow. And I don't know where we're at today. I thought it was very interesting when Zuckerberg was testifying to the Congress, they asked a question 1,600 different ways, and he wouldn't answer the question. Because he knows that ambiguity and lack of clarity works in his advantage in this space. But it may not work to the consumer's advantage of the broader economy's advantage if we don't figure out how to get to have some resolution where there's a consensus view on this. And I do \u8211\'20\'13 I do wonder where that conversation is going to happen, such that we're going to get to an answer that most people can be comfortable with. I just don't know where that's coming from.\par \par \uc2 MR. EVANS: If I could just \u8211\'20\'13 I know Rob says that, you know, there are many \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 you know, about how CEOs and businesspeople should think beyond just their own business situation. And I applaud that. I think that's sort of enriching everybody's thought process beyond, you know, what they may or may not do. But I really seriously, you know, think that, you know, CEOs, businesses, pursuing their own best interest or their business interest, that's going to lead to a better allocation of resources and I think better innovation and all that. To the extent that it has challenges with the workforce and whatnot, I mean, businesses have been led to sort of see that, well, I didn't really need to offer that generous benefits program to everybody.\par \par \uc2 And if I can kind of cut this, then, you know, I can improve my bottom line margin. And that's individually rational. And it works well. But it sort of loses the attachment between the workforce and the business, so 20 years later they're onboard when you're hoping that some people would make investments. It's like, well, we used to be part of that investment process. Now we're not. Who is picking up that \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible)? That's part of what this discussion is. I was in Grand Rapids last fall and met with some businesspeople. It was really very, very interesting. And in Grand Rapids, they have, you know, pretty good small manufacturers there. They have a vibrant philanthropic environment there. Some very wealthy people, but also just generally successful folks.\par \par \uc2 And what you would hear from some of these ventures are \u8211\'20\'13 they wouldn't say it this way \u8211\'20\'13 but the person who was in charge of economic development did say it this way. They're scared to death that they're constantly fielding offers from private equity folks to buy them out. And it's very compelling sometimes. And they're not really quite ready to do, but eventually they will. And everybody knows that when they sell out all the generous programs that they're offering to their employees are going to be marked down. Philanthropy is, you know, part of the cost, and so they can save that. And this is people doing the best business decision-making. And that's more efficient. But it has ramifications beyond that.\par \par \uc2 I just think that that's not something that the business community, per se, is going to do. They got to deal with scale. They got to do particularly well. I think it's other folks as well as government and other people too. So that's an important part of this. It's not monetary policy. But we need to be mindful of how these are affecting productivity in a way \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 Q: I actually have two questions. So, given all the uncertainties of this disruptive \u8211\'20\'13 these disruptive forces, you all discussed that one strategy is to proceed gradually, so that's fair. And we know that there's a discussion right now, given that you've completed a number of rate hikes, that we're getting close to what we would think of as neutral. What are you looking at to determine that we're getting close to neutral? That was question number one.\par \par \uc2 Question number two \u8211\'20\'13 and this is sort of more out-of-the-box thinking, not what we're learning in this conference \u8211\'20\'13 you know, this \u8211\'20\'13 is it \u8211\'20\'13 thinking about how does \u8211\'20\'13 what are the implications for the channels of monetary policy \u8211\'20\'13 so monetary policy eases financial conditions, right? And that makes things like credit ease and liquidity is plentiful, and that helps fund and finance disruption, right? So then easing monetary policy facilitates disruption, competition, and maybe it's disinflationary. And that's not the way we usually think about that, but that's a possibility that I think about when I hear about these forces. And then the flipside of that would be that as we tighten policy and we tighten financial conditions and credit tightens, that you reduce competition and you increase inflationary forces. So that's just crazy thought out there. That's question number two.\par \par \uc2 MR. EVANS: That's certainly the case that to the extent that credit is easier then you're going to make investments that most productive places \u8211\'20\'13 yeah, that could certainly lead to that. Now, I'm going to go ahead and take some consolation from what (inaudible) work would suggest, that \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 lags here, and how that actually affects inflation now I don't know. But I think what we always have to be mindful of is, you know, how are we doing relative to what we call now \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 inflation and price stability. We've said that's 2 percent (as measured by the personal-consumption expenditures price index). I take that to be core PCE \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 because it averages out across all \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 price volatility, and things like that, and that should be symmetric. So I think that, you know, we shouldn't just, when inflation's 1 \u189\'00\'BD, say, oh, it's going to get up to 2, that's good enough; but at 2.1, oh, geez, that's \u8211\'20\'13 you know, that's above 2 percent. I think we have to have a symmetric viewpoint of that. I think that's very difficult to discuss. And so, on your point about how do you assess the natural neutral federal-funds rate, I think it's, you know, we're making adjustments. We're making progress in increasing the (fed-funds) rate path. We're looking at inflation, and we're expecting it to get up to our 2 percent objective. And then we're all \u8211\'20\'13 we're going to be looking around to see how everything else is proceeding, and then make adjustments one way or another.\par \par \uc2 You're right to say we sort of said caution, and that's sort of the interest rate space where caution would be a slow, measured pace. But I also try to point to caution with respect to outcome space. And so, you know, you wouldn't want inflation to pick up too much, you know. So that could be consistent with a faster pace, and that would be cautious in terms of outcomes. But that's kind of semantics.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: So I agree with Charlie on the second point, that outcomes will inform sort of how we move in terms of policy. You know, sometimes I worry that there is an illusion of precision, that we know to the very decimal place exactly where we are at any moment \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 so we could say this is exactly where we should stop. And I don't think that that's true. So \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 can get kind of in the neighborhood, then you have to sort of see what's happening \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 to get the signals as to have you gone too far, have you not gone far enough, or are you in the sweet spot. And that's really how I'm going to approach it.\par \par \uc2 I think, you know, Dave reminds me all the time we let the data and the evidence inform our thinking. And I think that's really the only thing we can do.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: So I agree with that. And, you know, basically, if we're reaching our dual mandate, which I think we are or we're on our \u8211\'20\'13 we're certainly, if not there, we're on our way there \u8211\'20\'13 we should be moving toward neutral.\par \par \uc2 The new question is, what's neutral; i.e., R-star? And for that, we do our own model at the \uc2 Dallas Fed\uc2  but I look at everyone else's model \u8211\'20\'13 the Laubach-Williams (model), you name it. And then \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 lots of conversations with contacts, and then we come up with a view of what neutral looks like. I have said publicly, you know, between 2 \u189\'00\'BD and 3. Maybe, if I had to pin it down further, 2 \u189\'00\'BD, 2 \u190\'00\'BE, so \u8211\'20\'13 for now. This is subject to change. I think that's neutral and we should be gradually moving toward that.\par \par \uc2 And the third point is there are some people that suggest that maybe R-star can move up. You know, we're growing faster. I'm skeptical \u8211\'20\'13 in fact, highly skeptical \u8211\'20\'13 about that, which informs my thinking. And why am I highly skeptical? Aging workforce, slowing workforce growth. I fear continued sluggish productivity because our education and skill levels, I'm afraid they're going to continue to lag and we're going to \u8211\'20\'13 productivity's going to be surprisingly sluggish \u8211\'20\'13 I hope I'm wrong \u8211\'20\'13 you know, even with the lag effects. And I have a third concern, which is for all the stimulus \u8211\'20\'13 increasing debt-to-GDP is stimulative right now--I'm fearful that in the out years we ultimately start announcing this country in excess of trillion-dollar deficits. There may be more motivation or move to moderate future debt growth in the United States, which may in fact create some headwind for economic growth.\par \par \uc2 So I'm very skeptical that R-star is going to move up. And that's another reason why, once we get to neutral, I'm not yet there what we should do once we get to neutral. And I think we're going to have quite an agonizing debate for lots of reasons, including the shape of the yield curve, as we move along the path.\par \par \uc2 Q: I'd like to ask a question or ask you to comment on the other tools \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 lender of last resort and as a regulator and supervisor of the banking and financial system. (Inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 conventional FOMC monetary policy \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 et cetera, but we've had a long period of very low interest rates, and a lot of decisions were made in that environment. Some of them aren't going to work out later when the economy eventually goes down. We don't know when that will be.\par \par \uc2 And we've seen a lot of other things going on. We added a lot of rules and regulations. Some were recently amended \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 amended. But we've seen \u8211\'20\'13 we've seen at the same time a greater concentration of financial assets in the largest banks, concern about community banking. And, Charlie, you mentioned you imagine the public saying, well, we like your \u8211\'20\'13 we like your new rule and inflation's heading up, and we're not \u8211\'20\'13 and we're getting squeezed. But you're telling us it's a good thing.\par \par \uc2 But as interest rates start rising even more, even getting up to Rob's 3 percent, you're going to face an issue of how much you raise interest on reserves. And that's going to be a challenge when people start to see that all the money you've been making and turning over to the Treasury may actually turn negative. And for a while you'll be able to say, well, we made a lot of money; this is just a natural other side. But at some point that may become a big issue.\par \par \uc2 So this whole area of too big to fail, banking supervision and regulation, stress tests, and what happens if the \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 matter hits the fan in some institutions.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: I guess I'll \u8211\'20\'13 let's take \u8211\'20\'13 let's take the regulation part and then we'll take about the \u8211\'20\'13 your last one.\par \par \uc2 My own view is, the country has been very well-served by \u8211\'20\'13 for big banks in particular having very tough capital requirements and rigorous stress testing. I would be loath, at this stage in the economic cycle, to see us back off that. I do think we need regularly relief for small and midsize banks, so I'm glad we're seeing that.\par \par \uc2 I have a concern about the non-bank financial sector, where there may be embedded leverage \u8211\'20\'13 some visible, some not so visible \u8211\'20\'13 in derivative form that might be building up. But I think, from a regulatory point of view, I'd like to see us remain very tough \u8211\'20\'13 tough rules for the big banks and stress testing, and regulatory relief for small and midsize banks.\par \par \uc2 As it relates to, then, our goal ultimately as lender of last resort, I do think we're well-served by now allowing our balance sheet to run down, because I'm one of the people probably of another view \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). I'm of the view we may need to use it in the future. Why? Well, at a minimum, as we talked last night at dinner, because of the government fiscal situation, it's far less likely that you're going to have viable fiscal policy in the next downturn. And while it's not without controversy, I think the country may be well-served by at least then having the opportunity to have that debate when the time comes, to have tools at its disposal to act with more than just the fed-funds rate.\par \par \uc2 MR. EVANS: I think these are very good observations, on the one about potential capital losses from our balance sheet as interest rates go up. (Inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 economist, you would hope that having a nice, dispassionate conversation, the way that Ben Bernanke described in testimony, it looks as if, over 20 years, we are going to return to the Treasury $45 billion per year on average for 20 years, each year, whereas before we returned 25 billion. So that's an increase.\par \par \uc2 Now, we're not in the business of, you know, increasing \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 however you want to describe this. But it just turns out that this policy, even, you know, if we had some losses in a year or two, is likely to end up being a very good policy. Are we going to have that, you know, high-level discussion, or is it going to be optics of one or two years distorts a good policy and we have to take that off the table? I mean, as economists, we should be very unhappy with that public-policy outcome if it came that way.\par \par \uc2 Now, the balance-sheet increases have garnered a tremendous amount of criticism. And you really have to stop and think about what is central banking supposed to be about, and do you really care about hitting your inflation objective? If we only had a single objective, we would have done at least as much as we've done, if not more, because we were underrunning inflation by that amount. So it really makes you stop and think about central banking.\par \par \uc2 But you're exactly right. We've had to resort to tools that are unfamiliar, difficult to appreciate. When the world is doing much better, as for many of the Greenspan years, we could accept accolades, whether or not we deserved them or not \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 would be happy \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 you know, these are \u8211\'20\'13 these are controlled issues.\par \par \uc2 The financial-stability goal is a very important one. And I think that having the right supervisory policies is an important ingredient there because with low interest rates you could easily get some of the investment-type stuff comes that you're talking about. You want those supervisors to be on top of that, and hopefully that the financial industry would see that ahead of time and not engage in too much of that. But, again, private-sector businesses do what's very good for them. We're well-served by that in a capitalist society. We've just got to understand when we might be incenting too much of that.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: So I think that one thing that was clear at the beginning of the last financial crisis was banks didn't have enough capital. And so getting more capital in banking institutions is really important, and I would be very concerned if it's suggested that we were losing lots of capital \u8211\'20\'13 a lot of it was being released to be made available. So, for me, that's one dimension, I mean, that we need to remain diligent on.\par \par \uc2 I also think that the value of the stress test, in my view, is that it's supposed to get banking institutions to think in advance about some worst-case scenarios, so that when bad things happen it's not a complete surprise, that they have thought about it and potentially have a plan or some idea of a plan. And my concern is if we make the stress tests too routine, too rote, too expected, that institutions will not gain that muscle memory. They won't gain that capability. And I think \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 which is \u8211\'20\'13 which means that it's going to go rough, and rougher than I'd like it to.\par \par \uc2 Rob, you mentioned the non-bank sector. There's a lot more capital interaction and engagement and energy coming from that sector. And I think we would all do well to be thoughtful about how that's affecting \u8211\'20\'13 actually, this is where the locus of power is, really, banks versus non-banks, in terms of \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 capital in various sectors, because that has a different set of implications for where risk is likely to accrue and what institutions are going to need to be engaged in a conversation.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you. So, just returning to the core question of the conference about technology-related disruption, it seems that the technology shocks that we're experiencing certainly raise the possibility that it might be possible for the economy to operate at higher levels of resource utilization without excess inflation pressures than our conventional models suggest. And the panelists have talked about how one approach to take to this type of uncertainty is going back and learning, observing the data. The problem, of course, is about timelines, right? It may take time for a certain level of unemployment \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 inflation. Monetary policy also works with timelines. So I'm interested to also hear how you're going to try and reconcile these two things, the desire to learn from the data but a willingness to be sufficiently forward-looking in making policy.\par \par \uc2 And specifically in this context, is there a sort of level of unemployment where at this point you were looking at a couple years and said, well, if I thought unemployment was going to be going below X, I want to adjust policy to steer away, to make sure unemployment stabilizes at a higher level than this, even if I haven't yet seen evidence that this is feeding through its excess inflation pressures.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: So I'll tell you the way I go at this. And everybody has their own approach, but I'll just speak for mine and for what I try to work with my team in the \uc2 Dallas Fed\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Basically, I come up with a base case. So we debate here all sorts of scenarios. We have endless debates, not only at the \uc2 Dallas Fed\uc2  but with my colleagues around the FOMC table, about the various things that have happened \u8211\'20\'13 upside cases, downside cases, things we might be missing. And ultimately, I think for me, my thought process is to ultimately come up with a base case.\par \par \uc2 And what is that base case right now? I think the headline unemployment rate is going to dip certainly further down into the 3s. I think we'll ultimately meet our 2 percent inflation objective. But my base case is, because of to some extent globalization, but also because of technology-enabled disruption, I don't think inflation is going to run away from us \u8211\'20\'13 even though, in the short run, I think input costs are rising. My base case is that while GDP growth is strong this year, I think it's going to trail off and we're going to head back down towards 1\u190\'00\'BE to 2 percent over the next two or three years. And I told you what my monetary-policy prescription is for the base case.\par \par \uc2 What I'm doing, though, every \u8211\'20\'13 I wouldn't say every waking \u8211\'20\'13 every waking hour \u8211\'20\'13 you know, I'm a little obsessive \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 and with my colleagues is challenging that base case, talking to my team. Where might that base case be wrong? And I do a second thing, because I am very worried about the big structural drivers, many of which cannot be affected by monetary policy \u8211\'20\'13 aging demographics, slowing workforce growth, sluggish productivity. And, for me, the lack of investment in this country in human capital \u8211\'20\'13 sufficiently in human capital.\par \par \uc2 I think part of my job is, secondly \u8211\'20\'13 so I advocate policy based on the base case, be questioning and challenging with my colleagues and my team on that base case, and then talk about other probably nonmonetary aspects, structural drivers, and flag that so to help them do research on them to help inform policy makers broadly, so maybe we can make some progress. And I think this conference is a good example of that. I think that's the second part of my job how we deal with this, this trend and this uncertainty.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: I would add two things to that. One is really to talk about the constraints to the higher levels of growth. So what the sources of those constraints are, the barriers, so that policy makers actually have some idea about what they should be focusing on. And you know, this conference is part of that, so the workforce development stuff that we're doing systemwide is part of that. And so I think that's one thing.\par \par \uc2 A second thing is really \u8211\'20\'13 and I give \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 credit for this, I mentioned this before \u8211\'20\'13 we actually talk to people. I actually \u8211\'20\'13 it's my view that trends are well \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 before they show up in any aggregate data. And so, to the extent that you can tap into that in an early way, you can be on time. But in order to tap into that, you have to be systematic in how you engage with your broader constituencies.\par \par \uc2 And so we try to do that at our bank to make sure that we're covering sectors and we're covering geographies, we're covering small firms, large firms. But we're really trying to span the entire space \u8211\'20\'13 community-based organizations \u8211\'20\'13 to try to detect trends before they're in the data, so that we're not surprised when they actually show up in the data. And we are then able to change our base case to incorporate that and then have the data hopefully confirm it.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: And, by the way, just one of the nice things about the 12 regional banks, I think most Fed presidents and their teams are close \u8211\'20\'13 are actively out in the community, talking to people, calls with contacts. And it's enormously valuable for that reason.\par \par \uc2 MR. EVANS: Excellent question for discussion. During the financial crisis and the downturn, as I thought about policy then when we were so far away from our goals, I kept always thinking sort of, you know, what kind of mistake am I willing to make? You know, I might not know how the economy is going to proceed. Do we need to add accommodation? The fiscal \u8211\'20\'13 are the fiscal authorities, you know, adding help there? Or are they also providing headwinds? And so I think we, you know, constantly have to think about, by doing these aggressive accommodative policies, what mistakes am I willing to make? You know, or is it, look, we overshoot inflation. What if we never get unemployment down as low as 5 percent? What if we don't try hard enough?\par \par \uc2 OK, now fast-forward. The economy is doing really quite well. It has been for a number of years \u8211\'20\'13 slow progression. Fundamentals are good. And I've been looking for a nice return to normalcy, whatever normalcy sort of looks like in this world of changing technology disruption, you know, and all of that. But you would have guessed that monetary policy would become easier as we \u8211\'20\'13 I mean, not easier to implement. (Laughter.) I'm not \u8211\'20\'13 since I could easily have imagined unemployment getting down to 4 percent against the natural rate, 4 \u189\'00\'BD, OK, that's undershooting. Let's fill in the powerful \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 inflation rising to perhaps, you know, overshooting.\par \par \uc2 But, having said that, you know, the real rate of interest looks like, R-star, looks like it's lower. The demographics that Rob mentioned are also very important. But the other side is demographics are, you know, labor input growth is just likely to be not very strong at all. And I think most people have trend GDP growth of 1 \u190\'00\'BE percent. I'd love to have 3 percent. Trends \u8211\'20\'13 somebody's got to tell us how that happens. It's not going to come from monetary policy, and I'm not sure the tax policy is really going to deliver on that as well. But in a world of lower trend growth, we're facing less capacity in terms of the neutral funds rate and what we can do. But still, it's more towards normalcy.\par \par \uc2 But then we get fiscal policy. And, you know, we're, you know, looking at upwards of $1 \u189\'00\'BD trillion in additional debt over the next 10 years, so \u8211\'20\'13 and then the additional government spending that comes with that. And then Marty Feldstein tells us, oh, don't even consider the fact that they're not going to renew the additional defense spending. They know that's going to keep going. And so that's going to cause another set of issues with higher debt to GDP. And then the world environment being what it is, with negotiating trade \u8211\'20\'13 and there can be good things that come from that, but there could be risks as well \u8211\'20\'13 and so it's really still a very challenging environment.\par \par \uc2 So I thought we would be moving away from this risk-management focus on monetary policy more towards focusing on the center of the distribution and nudging things up. But we still have to be worried about that. So I think what mistakes are we willing to make over the next few years will continue to be a relevant question. And we'll have to talk that moving forward.\par \par \uc2 Q: Next time I come to one of these, I've decided that I'm going to bring an interpreter with me, because not being an economist and not being at the level that you guys and ladies in this room are, this is really good and I've been able to keep up. But it kind of brings to mind, you know, when you use the word stimulus, I'm assuming you're talking about, you know, another $500 million worth of defense spending that's going to go out there, a 14 percent decrease in the \u8211\'20\'13 and is that what you're talking about?\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: The recent \u8211\'20\'13 I'm talking about the tax legislation and the recent budget agreement.\par \par \uc2 Q: Recent budget? OK. I just interpreted it to be that. What that kind of brought to mind was that the decisions that you guys make are so impactful on just everyday Americans, every single day. And I applaud you, because you think about it in a way that is very responsible. But the things you just talked about, about how you're going out and talking to everybody else about what's going on. Now, living in your bubble \u8211\'20\'13 and I don't mean that offensively. I just mean, you know, this world that has been in this room. How do you \u8211\'20\'13 how do you get people outside this room to understand your decision-making processes without having to do one of these and bring an interpreter to understand? I mean, does that make sense? (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: Yes. So each of us has a \u8211\'20\'13 and I'll say this \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 a roadmap, meaning we go out there and we talk a lot. I mean, we're \u8211\'20\'13 each of us is out there a lot in small Rotary clubs \u8211\'20\'13 Wichita Falls for me; McAllen, Houston, Fort \u8211\'20\'13 you know, you name it. We're out there a lot in groups big and small, and very diverse. And we work very hard\u8230\'20\'26And we schedule very diverse groups. And you have a chance to road-test how you're explaining things. And if people don't quite get what you're saying, you get feedback immediately and you adapt it.\par \par \uc2 I used to say the term we're going to "remove accommodation." And they said: You mean, raise the fed-funds rate? Yeah, then raise the fed-funds rate. (Laughter.) I guess I could say that. So you get better at this. And so I think one of the things I would guess all of us \u8211\'20\'13 and, you know, we get a lot of practice out there, having to see whether we're understood and connecting with people up close, and we're doing it regularly.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: I would just say, for me, I just \u8211\'20\'13 I've been doing this for about a year. I'm living in a place I never lived before. So I just spend a lot of time just going places and just introducing myself and getting to know things on the ground. So, you know, from Miami to Sarasota, Jacksonville, outside Augusta, Georgia and Muscle Shoals, Alabama, New Orleans. We're trying to go to, like, different places, because what you said is right. People need to hear this stuff and hear it in a way that they can understand so that they're not afraid, right? The thing I worry about the most is that \u8211\'20\'13 is people hear about those disruptions and they get totally freaked out and they shut down. And we can't have that. So our ability to make a difference is to try to talk to them and give them some framework in how to think about things.\par \par \uc2 MR. ALTIG: All right, last question.\par \par \uc2 Q: I was going to go back to the question of the balance sheet. I'm curious to hear from each of you whether you think that the balance-sheet impact is \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 to the effect of forward guidance and the credibility of the policy in general. Is that all a bit more the stock effect, i.e., just translating into the amount of \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 you hold outstanding, or is it more about the flow in terms of purchases \u8211\'20\'13 new purchases actually \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible)? I'm just curious to hear where you stand today on that.\par \par \uc2 MR. EVANS: The good news is, you know, we've been explaining that we're, you know, allowing the balance sheet to roll off maturing assets. We're working our way up to $50 billion per month. I think that will get the balance sheet back to a size that is appropriate to the size of the economy, which is bigger than it was in 2007. And so I think that's \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 markets. We expect term premia to increase. It's going to be difficult to assess the implications because we're also going to be borrowing more on the fiscal side of that. But we'll just see how the economy is evolving. And as interest rates and mortgage rates and everything else goes up, we'll see if the economy is strong enough to continue to thrive as well as it is now. And that's a part of the assessment of what the neutral funds rate will be.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: I mean, I agree with everything that Charlie said. This program has been designed \u8211\'20\'13 at least my own input \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 has been designed to be a relatively manageable percentage of the Treasury market and the mortgage-backed securities markets, and to minimize the impact on trading levels of both markets. It's been designed with that in mind, and \u8211\'20\'13 which has made me optimistic that we can do this in a fairly gradual rate, without a lot of manifestations of it in terms of market prices. And so I think so far, so good.\par \par \uc2 Related Article\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-say-raising-rates-gradually-remains-the-best-approach-1527278325?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Fed Officials Say Raising Rates Gradually Remains the Best Approach}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20180530ee5u000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Tencent\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 WeChat\uc2  Pay and Alibaba\u8217\'20\'19s Alipay are encroaching on traditional lenders\par \par \uc2 What is a bank? As the banking editor of the Financial Times, this is something I should really know. But after visiting China earlier this month, I\u8217\'20\'19m starting to wonder whether the answer is quite so clear cut.\par \par \uc2 Nowhere is the definition of a bank being stretched more than in the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Hangzhou, where the fast-growing technology groups\u160\'00\'A0 Tencent and Alibaba \u160\'00\'A0are encroaching ever deeper into the domain of traditional lenders.\par \par \uc2 Take Tencent for instance. Its \uc2 WeChat\uc2  platform has expanded from a simple messaging app to a full-blown lifestyle platform used by\u160\'00\'A0 more than 1bn people. That is more than the combined populations of the US, the \uc2 EU\uc2  and Japan.\par \par \uc2 And financial services are a big part of it. Not only is \uc2 WeChat\uc2  Pay - along with its fierce rival Alipay - the dominant payment method in Chinese stores, using two-dimensional QR bar codes, it is also used to pay for most of the goods and services on the \uc2 WeChat\uc2  platform.\par \par \uc2 So when people hail a taxi, play a game, order a food delivery or book a holiday on \uc2 WeChat\uc2 , they can seamlessly pay for them in the background.\par \par \uc2 Often \uc2 WeChat\uc2  users will be offered the option to pay for something over several months rather than up front with consumer credit, and to protect themselves against damage or delay with insurance. They don\u8217\'20\'19t need a separate banking app. This is invisible banking.\par \par \uc2 At Tencent\u8217\'20\'19s headquarters in Shenzhen - which are being moved to a newly built twin-towers skyscraper (pictured, above) - visitors are shown how \uc2 WeChat\uc2  users can check which doctors are free at the nearest hospitals, before booking and paying for an appointment in only a few seconds.\par \par \uc2 Tim Leung, deputy general manager of Tencent\u8217\'20\'19s financial technology arm, says it is working with China\u8217\'20\'19s social security agency to allow pensioners to collect their benefits remotely, using facial-recognition systems, rather than having to go to a government office.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTo bridge the physical-digital gap in security you need to have face-recognition,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Leung, explaining that Tencent\u8217\'20\'19s system has a \u8220\'20\'1Cliveness detector\u8221\'20\'1D that can tell whether it is scanning a real person\u8217\'20\'19s face or a print-out.\par \par \uc2 The company has developed a way to verify car insurance claims remotely, using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to work out from a digital photograph of the damaged area of a car whether it needs replacing or repairing and how much it should cost.\par \par \uc2 As well as payments and insurance, Tencent is also targeting loans. Just over three years ago, it launched\u160\'00\'A0 WeBank, a newly licensed bank of which it owns 30 per cent.\par \par \uc2 WeBank has partnered with 40 Chinese lenders to offer unsecured short-term loans to a selection of \uc2 WeChat\uc2  customers. It chose the most creditworthy by analysing all the data it had on them, before contacting them to say they were pre-approved for a loan and could have the money in their account with only a few clicks.\par \par \uc2 By late last year, WeBank had\u160\'00\'A0already lent\u160\'00\'A0more than RMB100bn ($16bn) to over 6m \uc2 WeChat\uc2  users (many with no credit history) and had a default rate of less than 0.5 per cent. The loans are split, with 80 per cent going to the Chinese lenders and 20 per cent staying on WeBank\u8217\'20\'19s balance sheet, using a blockchain system to keep all parties updated.\par \par \uc2 Mr Leung says Tencent sees itself as a partner for mainstream financial institutions. \u8220\'20\'1CWe want to help banks and insurers to provide a smarter, more convenient and cheaper way to serve customers,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 But this is blurring the lines of banking. It is also getting up the noses of bankers. Executives at traditional lenders are\u160\'00\'A0 complaining \u160\'00\'A0to regulators that big tech groups like Tencent, Alibaba, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  are moving into financial services without being regulated like banks.\par \par \uc2 Behind the bankers\u8217\'20\'19 complaints is a fear of being disintermediated. I sat next to an \uc2 HSBC\uc2  executive on the way to see Tencent\u8217\'20\'19s headquarters in Shenzhen and he told me how Hong Kong had recently made it easier to offer financial services remotely, without a customer visiting a branch. He could already see the mainland Chinese tech groups moving in to capitalise on the opportunity.\par \par \uc2 Further fintech fascination\par \par \uc2 Generation game\u160\'00\'A0Millennials are constantly told to spend less and save more. So how can they take back control of their money? Welcome to the world of\u160\'00\'A0fintech apps. From budgeting and saving to investing in the stock market, a wave of financial innovation is redefining the ways millennials manage their money by delving deep into our spending data.\u160\'00\'A0Many customers might react with horror at the idea of a stranger peering into their bank account, but the millennial generation is much more open to this technology. So could an app digitally prod the younger generation into making savings by managing money more effectively \u8212\'20\'14 or would\u160\'00\'A0low salaries and high living costs prove an insurmountable barrier? Four millennial FT staffers in London each picked an app, and conducted a four-week trial with\u160\'00\'A0 a video diary \u160\'00\'A0to see just how much they could save.\par \par \uc2 Shoot for the sky\u160\'00\'A0Fintech was supposed to disrupt stodgy banks. Now hopes are high for\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 GreenSky\uc2 , the latest online upstart to go public, precisely because it has the backing of traditional lenders. In a rare feat for its industry, it also produces profits, at a decent margin too, as the company's point-of-sale revenue model reduces customer acquisition costs. But its target valuation - at 13 times trailing revenues -\u160\'00\'A0is still a blast from the past,\u160\'00\'A0 says the Lex column.\par \par \uc2 Crypto madness\u160\'00\'A0The\u160\'00\'A0human toll\u160\'00\'A0of\u160\'00\'A0cryptocurrency scams\u160\'00\'A0are all too easily overshadowed by the\u160\'00\'A0industry's excesses. But a line was crossed this month, when a self-described \u8220\'20\'1Cpublicity stunt\u8221\'20\'1D apparently led to a man's death,\u160\'00\'A0Alphaville reports.\par \par \uc2 Fintech\u160\'00\'A0views in the\u160\'00\'A0FT\u160\'00\'A0banking podcast\par \par \uc2 Bits and bobs\par \par \uc2 Losing it\u160\'00\'A0Back in 2013, when you could still mine bitcoins at home, \uc2 Wired\uc2  was sent\u160\'00\'A0a small, sleek mining device\u160\'00\'A0manufactured by the now-defunct\u160\'00\'A0Butterfly Labs. We turned on the\u160\'00\'A0Roku-looking machine\u160\'00\'A0in our San Francisco offices and allowed it to do its job. A small fortune was soon amassed,\u160\'00\'A0now worth around $100,000. Then, we lost the money. Forever. Here's\u160\'00\'A0what happened.\par \par \uc2 Float time\u160\'00\'A0Dutch payments group Adyen has\u160\'00\'A0 confirmed plans \u160\'00\'A0to list on the \uc2 Euronext\uc2  stock market in Amsterdam next month, setting the stage for an initial public offering that is expected to value the company\u8217\'20\'19s equity at between \u8364\'20\'AC6bn and \u8364\'20\'AC9bn.\par \par \uc2 India\u160\'00\'A0rising\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Amazon\uc2  appears to be restarting its funding efforts in India after\u160\'00\'A0Acko, the digital insurance startup in India, confirmed that the US\u160\'00\'A0retail giant led a new round of funding for its business,\u160\'00\'A0 writes Techcrunch\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180529ee5t0038p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Conversely, the team raised its position in insurance and construction stocks, as part of its \u8220\'20\'1Cmarket stabilisation role\u8221\'20\'1D, the bank added.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180528ee5s004h5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

NXP offers technology and services used for mobile payments.\par \par \uc2 The likely approval comes as the Trump administration is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-team-seeks-truce-with-congress-over-zte-1527268466"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 battling Congress to roll back penalties }}}\uc2  on Chinese telecommunications giant \uc2 ZTE Corp\uc2  ., and as U.S. Commerce Secretary \uc2 Wilbur Ross\uc2  prepares to lead an interagency delegation to Beijing starting June 2, where he is set to meet China's chief economic envoy, Liu He.\par \par \uc2 The acquisition of NXP is considered critical for San Diego-based \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  , which is dominant in smartphone chips but is looking for growth in other areas. Among NXP's products are chips for automobiles, a rapidly expanding sector as more technology is packed into cars.\par \par \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  had been waiting for Beijing's approval to proceed with the purchase of the Dutch company, having secured permission from the eight other major antitrust regulators around the world.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for \uc2 China's Commerce Ministry\uc2  said last month that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qualcomms-44-billion-purchase-of-nxp-has-hard-to-resolve-issues-china-1524108990"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the agency had conducted a preliminary review }}}\uc2  of the \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  deal's impact on competitors and the market, and had found "issues that are hard to resolve, making it difficult to eliminate the negative impact."\par \par \uc2 The State Administration for Market Regulation couldn't be reached immediately for comment.\par \par \uc2 On Saturday, Qualcomm's President \uc2 Cristiano Amon\uc2  spoke at the \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  Expo in Guiyang, southern China. While he didn't touch on the company's plan to acquire NXP, he emphasized \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  's commitment to China. "China is very important for \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  ," he said.

That same week, China's Vice President \uc2 Wang Qishan\uc2  told a group of visiting foreign business representatives, including a \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  executive, that the \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  and NXP deal stood a good chance of being approved by Chinese regulators, according to people with knowledge of the meeting.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. and its allies have been pressing Beijing to green light the deal. U.S. trade negotiators raised the issue with Mr. Liu recently in Washington, people briefed on the talks said. Chancellor \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  of Germany also lobbied for the deal in her meeting with Mr. Xi this week, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\par \par \uc2 In the case of ZTE, the Trump administration is now working to ease U.S. sanctions that had threatened to shutter China's second-largest telecom-equipment maker and the fourth-largest vendor of mobile phones in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Commerce Department{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-britain-issue-warnings-over-chinese-telecom-equipment-maker-zte-1523898318?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=22"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 last month banned U.S. companies }}}\uc2  from supplying the Chinese company for failing to live up to the terms of an agreement over ZTE's evasion of sanctions on sales to Iran and North Korea. \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  was one of ZTE's key suppliers.\par \par \uc2 But Trump administration officials have been {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-agree-on-broad-outline-to-settle-zte-controversy-1526959695"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 trying to negotiate a reprieve }}}\uc2 , saying that they never intended to put ZTE out of business and noting that the action is also hurting U.S. firms that supply ZTE.\par \par \uc2 That has drawn a backlash from Democratic lawmakers who say ZTE's violations were serious and should be punished.\par \par \uc2 The developments come as both sides appear to be retreating from the brink of trade war, declaring a truce amid ongoing negotiations.

Hg acquired the company in 2004, sold it to \uc2 Hellman & Friedman\uc2  in 2007, then bought it back in 2011 for an undisclosed price. The firm has now sold the company to its own Saturn fund\u8212\'20\'14a pool earmarked for large-cap software investments that is currently being raised\u8212\'20\'14and \uc2 Intermediate Capital Group PLC\uc2 . The deal will deliver a return of 4.2-times invested capital for Hg's sixth buyout fund, the firm said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The transaction echoes Hg's reinvestment in \uc2 Visma AS\uc2 , a similar business that operates in the Nordic region, last June. In a deal that valued the company at approximately $5.3 billion, \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . sold its majority shareholding in Visma while Hg increased its stake in the company, which it had originally backed in 2004. ICG partnered with Hg on the Visma deal too.\par \par \uc2 IRIS and Visma are among a string of investments Hg made after deciding in 2002 to focus on software companies that benefit from subscription-driven business models and tightening regulatory requirements, Nic Humphries, senior partner at Hg, told WSJ Pro Private Equity.\par \par \uc2 He said the latest investment valued IRIS at around 16.5 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Hg's willingness to pay up to extend its ownership prospects stems from the company's ability to weather a downturn.\par \par \uc2 "It's a business that has grown every year from 2007 to 2018\u8212\'20\'14that's an important characteristic for us," Mr. Humphries said. "They both [Visma and IRIS] continued to grow, and at very, very healthy rates, in the last recession, and we think they will do so again."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Humphries said IRIS has made 17 bolt-on acquisitions since 2011, and believes there is scope for the company to grow through further mergers and acquisitions. In addition, he said IRIS is continuing to develop more products in areas such as \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 . On that front, he said Hg seeks to help its portfolio benefit from each others' expertise by sharing best practice.\par \par \uc2 Hg said the sale follows an auction that process that started in March, adding that its partner on the deal, ICG, "submitted a compelling bid for participating in this investment."\par \par \uc2 The investment is the second Hg has made through the Saturn fund, the firm said, adding that the pool held its first close early this year. The fund has a \u163\'00\'A31.5 billion hard cap, WSJ Pro reported in March.\par \par \uc2 A person familiar with the matter added that Visma was the first company to be acquired by the Saturn pool, which aims to make four or five investments in large software businesses.\par \par \uc2 Although the fund has so far acquired two existing Hg portfolio companies, it wasn't designed explicitly for that kind of transaction and will also make more conventional investments by buying companies from their founders or from private-equity or corporate owners, the person added.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ed Ballard at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ed.ballard@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ed.ballard@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20180524ee5o000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Its downside is that it adds to the to-do list of regulators who already have a full plate to achieve the Trump administration's objectives.\par \par \uc2 Consider the agenda of just one regulator, the Federal Reserve. Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles has prioritized changes to the Volcker rule, now {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-sets-may-30-vote-on-proposed-volcker-rule-changes-1527106897"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 set for a May 30 vote}}}\uc2 . The Fed is taking comments on major changes to its stress tests and the supplementary-leverage-ratio rule. Mr. Quarles has also said he wants to address the following: two separate rules on bank liquidity, the total-loss-absorbing-capacity rule, stress-test transparency, living-will requirements, a big bank capital "surcharge," so-called advanced approaches capital rules, the application of the Bank Holding Company Act, cybersecurity best practices and rules flowing from the Community Reinvestment Act.\par \par \uc2 Got that? Now add a sampling of items from the bill Congress just passed:\par \par \uc2 1. Eighteen months after the bill becomes law, the asset threshold at which strict rules apply to big banks will rise to $250 billion. It's currently $50 billion. The Fed will be able to maintain tight rules on banks with under $250 billion in assets, and it will surely want to do that in some cases. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has told Congress the Fed will decide this by seeking public comment on a framework for deciding which banks get regulatory relief, and which don't.\par \par \uc2 2. The bill creates a new "community bank leverage ratio." Banks that meet it will be exempt from complex, risk-weighted capital rules, but bank regulators have to define it first.\par \par \uc2 3. The bill says the leverage ratio for custody banks \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 . can no longer include deposits those firms hold at central banks. The Fed will have to incorporate this into its leverage-ratio proposal, which would already lower capital requirements for those two firms. Mr. Quarles has said the Fed doesn't intend to allow "double counting," and his staff will have some math to do to accomplish that.\par \par \uc2 4. The legislation changes how commercial-real-estate lending must be treated under capital rules.\par \par \uc2 In total, that's more than a dozen important pieces of the regulatory agenda. Some of them will inevitably slip, given practical limits on staff time and Mr. Quarles's attention.\par \par \uc2 This week's expected confirmation of \uc2 Jelena McWilliams\uc2  as \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . head gives the Fed a potential ally at that agency. On the other hand, the midterm elections could empower enemies of deregulation in Congress, who could open investigations, write letters and hold hearings that create even more work for Mr. Quarles, Ms. McWilliams and other Trump nominees. The clock is ticking.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Regulator Presses for Revival of Small, Short-Term Loans\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulator-presses-for-revival-of-small-short-term-loans-1527098273"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Regulators under the Trump administration}}}\uc2  are encouraging banks to offer small, short-term loans to consumers in a bid to revive a riskier lending sector that dried up in the years after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , a national bank regulator, on Wednesday said it "encourages" financial firms to begin offering loans to be repaid over two to 12 months for amounts typically ranging from $300-to-$5,000. The loans carry higher interest rates than longer term loans.\par \par \uc2 The move, outlined in an OCC bulletin, marks a reversal from the Obama era, when regulators discouraged banks from making such loans, which are riskier than other types of lending.\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , Citi Lobby GOP Lawmakers to Relax Swap Rules\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-citi-lobby-gop-lawmakers-to-relax-swap-rules-1527100264"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 On the heels of a legislative victory}}}\uc2  this week for small and midsize banks, bigger banks including \uc2 JPMorgan Chase & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . are lobbying congressional Republicans in an effort to ensure a victory of their own.\par \par \uc2 Large banks are pushing Congress to redefine swap transactions made between different affiliates of the same company so that they aren't subject to certain rules stemming from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The move would prevent regulators from forcing banks to post collateral for those transactions, potentially saving banks hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs.\par \par \uc2 Legislation that would legally change the definitions of those transactions\u8212\'20\'14exempting them from Dodd-Frank collateral rules\u8212\'20\'14has passed the House, but has died in the Senate due to Democratic opposition.\par \par \uc2 Now, House Republicans have taken a harder-line approach to push the legislation through. In recent budget negotiations, they linked the exemption to increased funding for the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 , the primary swaps regulator that hasn't seen a funding increase since 2014. When some Senate Democrats objected to the exemption, it was stripped from the budget. The CFTC ended up having its funding cut by $1 million.\par \par \uc2 Fed Sets May 30 Vote on Proposed Volcker Rule Changes\par \par \uc2 The Federal Reserve set a May 30 vote on proposed changes to the Volcker rule, the first public step in an expected rewrite of the restrictions that have held back bank trading desks for years.\par \par \uc2 The rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, bans traders at taxpayer-insured banks from speculating but allows them to buy and sell securities in concert with customers' demand.\par \par \uc2 The Fed is the first regulator to set a date for discussing the proposal known as "Volcker 2.0." Four other agencies are also expected to adopt modifications to the rule. The changes will give large Wall Street banks more trading freedom, as regulators tweak restrictions on market making, hedging and other activities, according to people familiar with the discussions.\par \par \uc2 Market Players Envision Stock Exchange Powered by Blockchain\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-players-envision-stock-exchange-powered-by-blockchain-1527094212"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 As regulators crack down}}}\uc2  on the multibillion-dollar, fraud-tainted business of initial coin offerings, some market operators are exploring ways to bring them in line with U.S. securities law.\par \par \uc2 This week, a U.S. options exchange backed by Canada's TMX Group said it would team up with online retailer Overstock.com to create the first regulated exchange for "security tokens," which are essentially digital versions of stocks.\par \par \uc2 Security tokens use blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to manage the transfer of the shares from one owner to another. Unlike the tokens sold in many ICOs, they are designed to be compliant with \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  rules. Only a few security tokens have been issued to date.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia Tapped Its Central Bank to Pay 1MDB Debt\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysia-tapped-its-central-bank-to-pay-1mdb-debt-1527084852"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 In its final months in office}}}\uc2 , the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak turned to the nation's central bank to pay off $500 million in debt owed by the troubled state investment fund \uc2 1Malaysia Development Bhd\uc2 ., people familiar with the transaction said.\par \par \uc2 The fund, known as 1MDB, has been struggling to stay afloat, and the money helped cover an obligation due to an Abu Dhabi state fund at the end of 2017. The Malaysian fund said in December it came up with the money via an "ongoing rationalization program" that involved selling off holdings like power plants and land.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the people familiar with the transaction said, the money came from a land deal involving the central bank\u8212\'20\'14raising new questions about the use of state assets to support a fund the \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  says is mired in fraud.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank Zeroes In on Plans for 10,000 Job Cuts\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-zeroes-in-on-plans-for-10-000-job-cuts-1527080041"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG executives have zeroed}}}\uc2  in on plans in recent weeks to eliminate close to 10,000 jobs, or about one in 10 employees, as part of moves to accelerate cost-cutting, according to people familiar with internal bank discussions.\par \par \uc2 The latest plan, with cuts that likely would extend into 2019, follows months of thorny debate over how fast and deep job losses should be at the beleaguered German lender. The process has divided senior executives and left investors unconvinced.\par \par \uc2 Europe's Latest Fix for Its Banks: Opaque Trades\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-latest-fix-for-its-banks-opaque-trades-1527068944"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A European government-controlled fund}}}\uc2  is delving deeper into opaque trades that could potentially expose taxpayers to bank losses\u8212\'20\'14something post-financial crisis rules were meant to protect against.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Investment Fund\uc2 , controlled by European governments and a handful of big banks, is pushing into a fast-growing niche market in which banks pay a fee to investors to cover potential losses on loans.\par \par \uc2 The maneuvers are a form of synthetic securitization because no actual assets change hands. But they allow banks to free up their balance sheets to make more loans without selling assets or issuing equity.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: \uc2 Barclays\uc2 -Standard Chartered?\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/barclays-standard-chartered-i-cant-even-1527085569"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 When an activist investor comes knocking}}}\uc2 , boards like to look busy\u8212\'20\'14particularly if the activist is directly funded by a handful of your existing shareholders.\par \par \uc2 Barclays of the U.K. is in just such a position, but the idea that one potential answer is a merger of this trans-Atlantic consumer and investment bank with Standard Chartered, a trade-finance-driven emerging-markets bank, as reported in British media, seems unlikely to say the least. The report cited sources close to the bank's board.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Britain Takes Stab at Wrangling Dirty Money\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/britain-takes-stab-at-wrangling-dirty-money-1527111693"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The publication this week of a U.K. parliamentary report}}}\uc2  calling for tougher action to stop the flow of dirty Russian money into Britain is a landmark moment for the City of London.\par \par \uc2 Until now, almost all the pressure from within the U.K. political system to change the rules that have earned London its reputation as one of the money-laundering capitals of the world has come from those on the political left concerned about human rights, tax evasion and social justice.\par \par \uc2 The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report marks the emergence of a new cross-party consensus that Russian corruption has now become an issue of national security. The report alleges that Russian oligarchs aren't only laundering their ill-gotten wealth through London, but also using it to subvert Western democracies at the Kremlin's behest.\par \par \uc2 5 Questions About What to Expect When GDPR Takes Effect\par \par \uc2 On Friday, \uc2 European Union\uc2  privacy cops will start enforcing the new privacy law called GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-questions-about-what-to-expect-when-gdpr-takes-effect-1527154200?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Here are answers to some common questions}}}\uc2  about the deadline.\par \par \uc2 Raising the Bar\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-deregulation-bill-clears-congress-1527025690"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A central piece of a major bank deregulation bill}}}\uc2  that cleared Congress Tuesday could relieve about two dozen regional banks from stricter rules. It will raise the threshold at which banks face tighter oversight to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion\u8212\'20\'14a victory for midsize banks, which have long said they shouldn't be lumped in with the largest firms.\par \par \uc2 Unlike some of the bill's provisions that will have immediate effect, this provision won't take effect until regulators translate them into rules. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed would respond to the bill by seeking public input on a framework for deciding which firms with less than $250 billion in assets should get regulatory relief.\par \par \uc2 Nothing in the bill changes regulators' broad authority to apply strict rules to firms they view as risky, even if they have less than $250 billion in assets. Nevertheless, the bill sends a strong signal to regulators that Congress wants a more tailored rulebook, with looser reins for small and midsize lenders.\par \par \uc2 Thursday, May 24\par \par \uc2 7:30 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  member \uc2 Michael Piwowar\uc2  speaks to the Investment Company Institute's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://gmm.ici.org/gmm/18_program_gmm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 general membership meeting}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 9:30 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Banking Committee {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/cybersecurity-risks-to-the-financial-services-industry-and-its-preparedness"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 holds a hearing}}}\uc2  on cybersecurity risks to the financial services industry and its preparedness.\par \par \uc2 Smaller Businesses Prefer Smaller Banks\par \par \uc2 Most small-to-midsize businesses in the U.S. and U.K. are considering switching banks\u8212\'20\'14particularly those that use larger financial institutions\u8212\'20\'14to take advantage of new services or more competitive fees, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bit.ly/2sbP5HQ"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a study}}}\uc2  by fintech firm FIS. Based on a survey of 321 businesses in the U.S. and 253 in the U.K., FIS found that most of the U.S. respondents reported higher satisfaction with community banks over larger banks. "In the U.K., nearly one in four [small-to-midsize businesses]\u8212\'20\'14most of which use larger banking providers\u8212\'20\'14are planning to switch banking providers in the next 12 months," the FIS report says. "Common reasons cited\u8230\'20\'26in both countries for switching banks are uncompetitive fees, dissatisfaction with services/products provided, outdated bank processes, or being declined for a business loan/line of credit," the report says.\par \par \uc2 Sarbanes-Oxley Is Ripe for a Rewrite\par \par \uc2 The Sarbanes-Oxley law "has made it much more costly for startups to go public in the U.S., and even more difficult for individual investors to participate in startups," Ike Brannon of Capital Policy \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  writes in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ikebrannon/2018/05/23/injecting-common-sense-into-financial-markets/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Forbes opinion piece}}}\uc2 . "This law is a major reason that companies like Uber, which is valued in the tens of billions of dollars, continue to eschew any public offering," he says.

Big banks that have been able to handle heavy regulation have grown bigger, while smaller banks have closed, the board says. The bill "should help smaller banks focus on serving customers rather than regulators," the board writes, though it notes that it would have preferred House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling's Choice Act, which called for exempting banks from the strictest rules if they maintain a 10% leverage ratio.\par \par \uc2 Abraaj Group\uc2 , the Dubai-based private-equity firm under scrutiny for allegedly mismanaging money in a health-care fund, also {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/abraaj-already-under-scrutiny-tapped-another-client-fund-to-finance-itself-1527089842"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 used more than $200 million of investor money}}}\uc2  from a $1.6 billion buyout fund to help finance its own business, according to people familiar with the situation.\par \par \uc2 If it seems like several female CEOs have lost their jobs lately, it is because they have.

The average internet user must contend with remembering login information for 150 different accounts, according to International Business Machines Corp. Passwords are also a costly affair: Calls to company technical support lines to reset passwords cost an average of $70 each, according to \uc2 Forrester Research\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some organizations are coming up with alternatives to passwords that can be adopted by the enterprise. A consortium of companies, including Amazon Inc., \uc2 Intel Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 ., are pushing the Fast Identity Online Initiative, known as FIDO with the goal of developing alternatives to ultimately eliminate passwords.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2  stopped recommending that its Department of Defense clients use passwords this past year, and instead, instructed them to take the long-endorsed, multi-layered approach to authentication, said Alan Laing, a senior expert for authentication and control with the \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Even simple multi-factor authentication alternatives can offer better security than passwords, Dr. Laing and other cybersecurity experts say.\par \par \uc2 NSA-level security interpreted for the enterprise. Government agencies have pioneered several password alternatives since as early as 1999, and their use has grown to include nearly all military and defense organizations, Dr. Laing said. That includes the three million employees of the \uc2 U.S. Department of Defense\uc2  served by NSA technology, he said.\par \par \uc2 Many DoD employees use smartcards, which they insert into a proprietary card reader to access their computers. Biometric methods including facial recognition and fingerprint scanners have also been added to defense systems, Dr. Laing said. The NSA provides the technologies to government agencies, but doesn't track adoption rates of specific tools, he said.\par \par \uc2 Government technologies like these have had a mixed reception in private enterprise, said Merritt Maxim, a principal analyst on authentication with \uc2 Forrester Research\uc2 , but they provide valuable insight into how corporations can structure their approach to protect data. Rather than invest in costly smartcard systems or large-scale biometric products, companies can gain an NSA-like edge by simply adding several layers of authentication to corporate devices with smartphones or encrypted tokens, said Mr. Maxim.\par \par \uc2 These are options that are often more popular with employers, because they allow staff to use technologies they have on hand, said Selim Aissi, chief information security officer of mortgage-servicing company \uc2 Ellie Mae Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Any technology alone is vulnerable. Passwords alone are not especially vulnerable, but are worse off in the absence of other variables, said Dr. Laing. Newer technologies are similarly vulnerable, if they are not intermixed with other types of verification, he said.\par \par \uc2 Some vendors are adding more technologies to make it easier for companies to integrate multiple-identity factors. \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  added facial recognition to its Windows 10 operating system, said Dave Bossio, head of Windows operating system security and identity at \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 . It also offers hardware keys that users can avail themselves of to protect sensitive data. "We want to get to a point where it's much easier for any enterprise to have adaptable tech that can replace passwords without adding more hardware or costs," said Mr. Bossio.\par \par \uc2 Future is in context-based authentication. \b \highlight22\uc2 Machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  will contribute in large part to a future where contextual cues take the place of a second or third factor of authentication, said Sridhar Muppidi, chief technology officer at International Business Machines Corp.\par \par \uc2 IBM\uc2  has been using and developing technologies that combine authentication methods with \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , allowing attributes of a certain person -- like browser preferences, typing speed or geolocation -- to contribute to an algorithm that approves the user for login. If an individual's attributes fail to conform to the standard hallmarks, access can be denied.\par \par \uc2 Companies including \uc2 Aetna Inc\uc2 . have been piloting behavioral \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  as part of the authentication process for both customers and employees, according to the company, which said it has rolled out behavioral authentication for more than 1.6 million users.\par \par \uc2 Write to Kate Fazzini at kate.fazzini@wsj.com.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20180523ee5n0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PARIS\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . has agreed to pay for sick leave and some other health-related benefits for its regular drivers and couriers in Europe in a bid to ease tensions with workers seeking better employment perks.\par \par \uc2 The ride-hailing firm said Wednesday that the new benefits will apply initially to about 150,000 independent Uber workers across the \uc2 European Union\uc2  beginning in June, provided they have worked minimum levels over the prior two months. The step marks the first time the company has fully covered the cost of some form of insurance for its independent workers.\par \par \uc2 The coverage addresses both driving injuries and sick pay for severe illnesses unrelated to driving. Uber is also offering other benefits, such as a lump-sum payment of \u8364\'20\'AC1,000 or \u163\'00\'A31,000 for maternity and paternity leave.\par \par \uc2 Labor activists in the U.S. and Europe have launched an array of lawsuits demanding worker rights and benefits for people who work in the so-called gig economy, where apps distribute individual tasks like delivering food or washing laundry to people the company regards as independent contractors. In response, companies like Uber have been sweetening their benefits, while avoiding full employment rights that could raise their costs significantly.\par \par \uc2 Uber said it is paying for the European insurance through a "multimillion-dollar deal" with French financial giant \uc2 AXA SA\uc2 . The policy could increase pressure on the company to roll out expensive insurance schemes in other parts of the world\u8212\'20\'14adding costs at a time when Uber is trying to pare them. The company says it plans to extend similar coverage outside the \uc2 EU\uc2 , but didn't specify which countries or when.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S., Uber does insure drivers with vehicle-accident protection up to $1 million while driving for the company. And it offers some discounted insurance for disability or death to a driver through a partnership with \uc2 Aon PLC\uc2 . But these programs don't go as far as what will be offered in Europe.\par \par \uc2 Uber's European initiative is one of several that technology executives were touting as they gathered in Paris on Wednesday to meet with French President \uc2 Emmanuel Macron\uc2  at a summit titled "Tech for Good." Uber CEO \uc2 Dara Khosrowshahi\uc2  was in attendance, along with \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 .'s \uc2 Satya Nadella\uc2  and \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 .'s \uc2 Ginni Rometty\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A major theme is the impact on jobs from both wider use of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the growing popularity of gig-economy companies. \uc2 IBM\uc2 , for instance, said Wednesday that it will create 1,800 new jobs in France, and introduce a program to train employees of clients and partners in France "to build modern skills for the AI era."\par \par \uc2 Uber's new insurance policy is the latest conciliatory gesture by Uber since Mr. Khosrowshahi took over from company co-founder \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2  last fall. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-uber-backers-orchestrated-kalanicks-ouster-as-ceo-1498090688"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mr. Kalanick quit as CEO under pressure}}}\uc2  after a series of scandals, including one in which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ceo-says-he-needs-leadership-help-after-video-shows-him-slamming-driver-1488347091"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 he was videotaped berating an Uber driver}}}\uc2  who had complained to him about falling fares.\par \par \uc2 "We called drivers 'partners,' but didn't always act like it," Uber said Wednesday, announcing the insurance. "We focused too much on growth and not enough on the people who made that growth possible."\par \par \uc2 Some worker advocates in the \uc2 EU\uc2  were disappointed with Uber's announcement. "Sadly, this is once again a case of tinkering around the edges for a quick PR win, rather than dealing with the issue at hand," said James Farrar, head of the car-hire branch of \uc2 Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-loses-appeal-against-u-k-ruling-on-drivers-rights-1510313218"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 which is suing Uber for full worker rights}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Uber's coverage relating to personal injury and illnesses varies by country and whether an individual was working or not. If an accident occurs when an Uber driver is on a trip with a ride-hailing passenger or a courier is making a delivery, the new policy reimburses some medical expenses and 80% of the median gross daily earnings for lost work days from injuries for up to 30 days. The earnings figure, which varies by market, works out to \u8364\'20\'AC1,200 in France ($1,405) and \u163\'00\'A32,250 in the U.K., according to Uber. Any permanent disability resulting from an accident on a trip with a passenger is covered up to \u8364\'20\'AC50,000 or \u163\'00\'A350,000.\par \par \uc2 But if a driver isn't on a trip\u8212\'20\'14whether he or she is cruising around waiting for one or at home eating dinner\u8212\'20\'14the insurance will only cover lost daily earnings resulting from injuries and illnesses, provided they are severe enough to cause the driver to miss seven days of work. The benefit is at the same rate as when on trips but lasts for only 15 days, Uber says.\par \par \uc2 Write to Sam Schechner at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:sam.schechner@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sam.schechner@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-first-quarter-sales-rise-70-as-it-preps-for-ipo-1527107700"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Uber's First-Quarter Sales Rise 70% as It Preps for IPO}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-new-rules-on-arbitration-for-sex-claims-face-first-test-1526932911"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Uber's New Rules on Arbitration for Sex-Related Claims Face First Test}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-product-chief-jeff-holden-is-leaving-company-1526596699"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Uber's Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden Is Leaving Company}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-to-shutter-rush-delivery-service-1522460481"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Uber to Shutter Rush Delivery Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180523ee5n0013q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Now, the tables have turned as fintech firms are learning the pitfalls of associating with businesses often in regulators' crosshairs.\par \par \uc2 A lawsuit seeking class-action status filed this month in federal court in Washington state accuses ZestFinance Inc., a California-based maker of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  software for underwriting personal loans, of engaging in a "\u8216\'20\'18rent-a-tribe' scheme" with BlueChip Financial. The online lender is affiliated with the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, a North Dakota tribe. Lenders with ties to tribes argue they aren't subject to state laws due to their sovereign status.\par \par \uc2 In the suit, plaintiff Teresa Titus alleges that she took out several $600 to $800 loans on BlueChip's Spotloan website, at annual rates ranging between 390% and 460%, higher than Washington's maximum allowed interest rate. Ms. Titus said she paid a total of $5,976.04 to BlueChip to repay $3,000 in loans.\par \par \uc2 The state's financial institutions regulator said last year that BlueChip was "not licensed in Washington," and therefore not allowed to make small loans to its residents.\par \par \uc2 Notably, the lawsuit targets not only BlueChip, but also ZestFinance and its CEO, former \uc2 Google\uc2  executive Douglas Merrill.\par \par \uc2 "At the direction of Merrill and ZestFinance, a tribal entity, BlueChip Financial was created to serve as a front to disguise ZestFinance and Merrill's role in making usurious loans," the complaint says.\par \par \uc2 ZestFinance called the lawsuit baseless and said the company "provides underwriting technology to financial institutions around the globe."\par \par \uc2 BlueChip Chairman Jamie Azure said in a statement that his company had the right to make the loans, and that it had a "substantial stake" in the profits and risks associated with the loans. "Because of its use of the newest underwriting technology, BlueChip has been able to address a gaping need in the American financial system," Mr. Azure said.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, filed by an established class-action law firm, could sow concern among fintech firms about teaming up with tribal lenders\u8212\'20\'14a business model that has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kansas-city-businessman-gets-nearly-17-years-for-payday-lending-scheme-1515190826"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 drawn scrutiny from U.S. authorities}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To be sure, some of this pressure has begun to wane. \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  in January dropped a lawsuit against four payday lenders affiliated with a California tribe.\par \par \uc2 But under the Trump administration, plaintiffs' attorneys, as well as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-target-consumer-issues-as-federal-oversight-eases-1522920601"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 liberal state attorneys general}}}\uc2 , appear to be taking over where the federal government is relinquishing pressure on the industry\u8212\'20\'14for traditional financial institutions and fintechs alike.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 How Congress Rolled Back Banking Rules in a Rare Bipartisan Deal\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-congress-rolled-back-banking-rules-in-a-rare-bipartisan-deal-1527030512"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ten days after his inauguration, President Donald Trump}}}\uc2  promised to "do a big number" on the Dodd-Frank law that tightened rules on financial firms after the 2008 crisis.\par \par \uc2 Behind the scenes, his then top economic adviser and a powerful senator settled on a less ambitious plan. And in recent weeks, Mr. Trump called a senior House lawmaker, urging him to move forward despite objections from Republicans who wanted broader changes.\par \par \uc2 The strategy to seek modest Dodd-Frank changes, agreed to in private by Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) and former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn in early 2017, paid dividends on Tuesday: The House of Representatives by 258-159 approved the resulting bipartisan legislation, sending it to the president for his expected signature.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-deregulation-bill-clears-congress-1527025690"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bank Deregulation Bill Clears Congress}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fine-print-whats-in-the-bank-deregulation-bill-1526935145"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Fine Print: What's in the Bank Bill}}}\par \par \uc2 Small Banks' New Money Maker: Bitcoin\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-needs-bankers-too-a-handful-of-community-banks-say-yes-to-crypto-1526997601"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 To many banks, bitcoin}}}\uc2  and other digital currencies are a mania, or worse. But to a handful of small lenders, they are a moneymaker.\par \par \uc2 Take \uc2 Silvergate Bank\uc2 , a three-branch lender that until recently focused mostly on local businesses in the San Diego area. Last year, its assets nearly doubled to $1.9 billion from $978 million, largely because of business flowing in from crypto-related companies.\par \par \uc2 Big banks' decision to largely shun the crypto world has left an opening for smaller lenders such as Silvergate, \uc2 Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp\uc2 . in New York and Cross River Bank in Fort Lee, N.J. In part their decision reflects an environment where community banks often struggle to differentiate themselves, given larger firms often can offer consumers and businesses largely unmatchable conveniences with their geographic reach and deployment of mobile and other technology.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: U.S. Traders Allowed to Invest in Australian Derivatives\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  announced that it will allow U.S. customers to trade at the Australia Securities Exchange Limited without having to register with the CFTC, part of a longstanding international deference program. The CFTC determined that the Australian exchange has a comparable set of regulatory requirements to those used in the U.S., allowing the agency to defer to Australian regulators and not impose its own standards. Australia becomes the latest in a string of jurisdictions around the globe to which the CFTC has granted regulatory deference, including India last week.\par \par \uc2 Blockchain Talent Wars Escalate, Hindering Product Development\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blockchain-talent-wars-escalate-hindering-product-development-1527006462"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 David Schwartz, the chief cryptographer}}}\uc2  at blockchain startup Ripple Inc., recently saw a developer on his team receive not one, but two, $1 million signing bonus offers.\par \par \uc2 He said one offer was from a cryptocurrency startup, the other from a large technology company with a blockchain initiative. Pay packages for cryptocurrency talent "have gotten insane," Mr. Schwartz said.\par \par \uc2 Billions of dollars have poured into the sector through initial coin offerings and venture capital. At the same time, technology companies such as \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 ., and \uc2 IBM\uc2  , are mounting their own efforts to work with blockchain-based technology, stoking a fight for talent.\par \par \uc2 Some 4,500 job openings with the terms "blockchain," "bitcoin" or "cryptocurrency" in the title were posted on LinkedIn this year through mid-May, according to the company. That is up 151% over the total in all of 2017. Just 645 such job openings were posted in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Chinese Tech Unicorns Try a Different Approach to Raising Cash\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-tech-unicorns-try-a-different-approach-to-raising-cash-1526981401"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 After multiple rounds of fundraising}}}\uc2 , some of China's most valuable private technology companies are turning to a less common way of raising capital: Issuing convertible securities.\par \par \uc2 The emerging trend is a result of technology companies' increasing need for cash to fund their expansion at home and abroad, which has involved heavy spending on marketing and other costs to acquire customers and fend off rivals.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: SEC Chairman Seeks New Ways to Battle Penny-Stock Fraud\par \par \uc2 The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission wants to find a new way to battle penny-stock frauds. Jay Clayton said there are still many low-priced and thinly traded stocks "that have been penny stocks for years" and are vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes and other forms of price manipulation. "I don't know when I have ever seen it not be a problem," he told a legal conference sponsored by the \uc2 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\uc2  on Tuesday. "So why are we doing it?" Mr. Clayton says in a brief interview that he's "looking for suggestions" to "do better."\par \par \uc2 U.S. Banks See Record 1Q Profit\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-banks-report-record-first-quarter-profit-1526999856"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. banks notched a record}}}\uc2  quarterly profit to start 2018, newly released data show, a result of the new tax law, rising interest rates and an improving economy.\par \par \uc2 The industry, spanning banks from global giants such as \uc2 JPMorgan Chase & Co\uc2 . to tiny community lenders, reported $56 billion in net income in the first quarter, up 27.5% from the prior year's quarter, the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . said Tuesday. The new U.S. tax law gave banks a boost, but profits still would have been $49.4 billion without it, the FDIC said. The previous record was the second-quarter profit of $48.1 billion last year.\par \par \uc2 That profit surge, driven by dual jumps in trading revenue and lending income, helped banks comfortably exceed their cost of capital for the first time in over a decade. Banks' return on equity was 11.44%, the highest level since 2007, though it is still well below the 15% high-water mark reached in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\par \par \uc2 That's a strong indication that banks have managed to adapt their businesses to new regulations put in place following the 2008 financial crisis. They have also been helped by consumers and businesses who, at the moment, are both eager to borrow and are paying back their loans.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday, May 23\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Federal Housing Finance Agency\uc2  Director \uc2 Mel Watt{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/ten-years-of-conservatorship-the-status-of-the-housing-finance-system"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 testifies}}}\uc2  at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the status of the housing finance system.\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Investment holds a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bit.ly/2GCDaYK"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 hearing on 11 legislative proposals}}}\uc2 , including measures that would reduce how much information companies disclose to the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Thursday, May 24\par \par \uc2 7:30 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  member \uc2 Michael Piwowar\uc2  speaks to the Investment Company Institute's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://gmm.ici.org/gmm/18_program_gmm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 general membership meeting}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Banking Committee {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/cybersecurity-risks-to-the-financial-services-industry-and-its-preparedness"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 holds a hearing}}}\uc2  on cybersecurity risks to the financial services industry and its preparedness.\par \par \uc2 Banks' Cybersecurity Investments Might Be Misdirected\par \par \uc2 "The impact of open banking and tighter security and data rules\u8212\'20\'14and the conflicts between them\u8212\'20\'14do not appear to be fully understood" by bank executives, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.temenos.com/globalassets/mi/wp/2018/eiu/temnos-global-retail-banking-whitepaper.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a report}}}\uc2  by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Based on a survey of 400 global banking executives this year, the EIU found most respondents (71%) focused their digital investment on cybersecurity, but "only 17% are concerned about a third-party relationship vulnerability being exploited as a result of open banking." Most participants believe technology will greatly transform the banking industry by 2020, with more than half saying customers will forgo human contact if services are free or cheap (56%) and that less than 5% of retail transactions will be in cash (64%). "A disturbing 47% believe that a cyber-attack will have caused at least one systemic bank failure," the report says.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB Should Be Fixed, Not Stripped\par \par \uc2 If President Donald Trump wants to dismantle the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  or change its duties, he should seek a change in the law, not try to sabotage it from the inside out, writes the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2018/05/21/Do-the-job-or-depart-Mick-Mulvaney-should-resign-from-the-CFPB/stories/201805170104"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 editorial board}}}\uc2 . Recent moves by Trump-appointed acting Director Mick Mulvaney show "apparent disregard for the work of the CFPB," despite the bureau's successes against unscrupulous lending practices and in returning money to consumers, the board says.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 After multiple rounds of fundraising, some of China's most valuable private technology companies are turning to a less common way of raising capital: Issuing convertible securities.\par \par \uc2 Ride-hailing giant \uc2 Didi Chuxing Technology Co\uc2 . is in talks with potential investors about a sale of bonds that could later be exchanged into stock shares in the Beijing-based company, according to people familiar with the matter. It isn't known how much Didi is trying to raise in this manner, but the company recently {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-ride-hailing-giant-hits-accelerator-on-talks-for-potential-ipo-1524553831"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 accelerated talks about a potential initial public}}}\uc2  offering that could take place later this year, people familiar with the matter previously told The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 Another fast-growing Chinese startup, Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., in recent weeks issued about $300 million in convertible bonds to private-equity firm \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 ., according to other people familiar with the matter. The company, which owns a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-news-reads-you-in-chinaand-people-cant-get-enough-of-it-1503570085"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 popular Chinese news-aggregation app }}}\uc2 called Jinri Toutiao, was valued at $22 billion in an equity fundraising round in late 2017, according to an individual familiar with that transaction.\par \par \uc2 Spokespeople for Didi, Bytedance and \uc2 KKR\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The emerging trend is a result of technology companies' increasing need for cash to fund their expansion at home and abroad, which has involved heavy spending on marketing and other costs to acquire customers and fend off rivals.\par \par \uc2 Selling convertible securities allows companies to raise capital with less dilution to existing shareholders, while giving buyers of the instruments an opportunity to reap additional gains if and when the debt converts into stock down the road.\par \par \uc2 The securities, which have both stock and bond-like characteristics, typically pay investors interest for an initial period and can be converted into shares in the issuing company, often at a predetermined price or price range. The annual interest payments on convertible securities also can be a few percentage points lower than rates on traditional unsecured bonds.\par \par \uc2 Some high-profile technology companies that previously sold convertible securities before going public include Chinese e-commerce giant \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 . and music-streaming company \uc2 Spotify Technology SA\uc2 . When Alibaba issued such instruments in 2012, investors in effect were given the right to swap the convertible securities for common shares in the company at a discount to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-shares-trade-higher-in-ipo-1411142120"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Alibaba's IPO }}}\uc2 price when it went public at in 2014.\par \par \uc2 In the case of Spotify, the company issued $1 billion in convertible debt to a group of investors in 2016, also about two years before it went public. \uc2 Sea Ltd\uc2 ., a Southeast Asia digital entertainment and e-commerce company backed by \uc2 Tencent Holdings Ltd\uc2 ., also issued convertible securities before it went public on the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2  last year.\par \par \uc2 Private companies selling convertible bonds often have a road map for an eventual IPO, typically within 12 to 18 months, said Aaron Oh, head of structured equity origination for Asia Pacific at \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG\uc2 . If an IPO doesn't materialize, however, companies could be on the hook to repay debtholders.\par \par \uc2 Didi and Bytedance are among a new wave of fast-growing Chinese internet and technology startups that eventually could challenge the dominance of China's e-commerce giants Alibaba and Tencent in some areas. Both startups have raised funds by selling equity several times in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Didi as of the end of 2017 had {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-ride-sharing-app-didi-raises-4-billion-in-new-funding-1513820940"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 raised more than $20 billion }}}\uc2 in equity and debt funding, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, and the company was valued at $56 billion in its last private-fundraising round. The company is eyeing a valuation of at least $70 billion to $80 billion when it goes public, people familiar with the matter previously told the Journal.\par \par \uc2 It isn't clear how much Bytedance is worth based on the new capital injection. Some recent trades in its unlisted shares valued the company between $35 billion and $40 billion, said a person familiar with the situation.\par \par \uc2 Jinri Toutiao, a personalized news app founded by Chinese entrepreneur and Bytedance CEO Zhang Yiming, is one of China's most popular news apps, with 120 million daily active users. Toutiao, which translates to "Today's Headlines," curates entertainment, business and general news, using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to analyze users' reading histories and feeds them content based on their preferences. Bytedance also runs Douyin, a short-video streaming platform that is gaining in popularity.\par \par \uc2 Both Didi and Bytedance have had their share of recent controversies. On May 11, Didi suspended one of its ride-hailing services after a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/didi-partially-suspends-ride-hailing-service-after-passenger-death-1526044088"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 21-year-old female passenger was killed}}}\uc2  by a driver after using the company's carpooling service. Didi earlier this month said it would review all of its drivers and overhaul its customer service.\par \par \uc2 In April, Bytedance's humor app, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-target-for-chinas-censors-content-driven-by-artificial-intelligence-1523446234"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Neihan Duanzi, was shut down }}}\uc2 by Chinese authorities on the grounds that it hosted lewd content, including dirty jokes and memes, which the authorities said wasn't keeping with "a clean online audiovisual environment."\par \par \uc2 Toutiao also was temporarily removed from Chinese app stores due to concerns over what a national media watchdog called "vulgar" content. The move prompted a public apology by Mr. Zhang, its CEO, who said the company would hire more censors and improve its \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial Intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  systems and filtering to be more socially responsible.\par \par \uc2 Write to Julie Steinberg at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:julie.steinberg@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 julie.steinberg@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Liza Lin at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Liza.Lin@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Liza.Lin@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related Reading\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-ride-hailing-giant-hits-accelerator-on-talks-for-potential-ipo-1524553831?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Chinese Ride-Hailing Giant Didi Hits Accelerator on Talks for IPO}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-news-reads-you-in-chinaand-people-cant-get-enough-of-it-1503570085?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The News Reads You in China\u8212\'20\'14and People Can't Get Enough of It}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-ride-sharing-app-didi-raises-4-billion-in-new-funding-1513820940?mod=article_inline"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Chinese Ride-Sharing App Didi Raises $4 Billion in New Funding}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180522ee5m000ru\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The financing will be used to develop more capabilities of the software and expand Luma's customer base. Currently, the software is in use in about 200 clinics across the United States.\par \par \uc2 Luma's software is designed to help clinics manage appointments, referrals and follow-ups through integrations with more than 55 electronic health records and IT systems. The company recently added a bot-enabled messaging functionality that allows patients to communicate directly with their care team.\par \par \uc2 The goal is to reduce missed appointments and communication breakdowns that result in wasted time and resources. Dr. Fareed Elhaj of Houston Thyroid and Endocrine Specialists, a customer since 2016, said the software improved its appointment capacity by 7% and increased revenue by about $100,000 per year.\par \par \uc2 Several startups have developed software aimed at making clinician workflow and doctor-patient communication more efficient, but few attempt to do both.

There are still outstanding regulatory issues, particularly around consumer protection, but they are no longer the priority.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A senior executive at one British bank said that \u8220\'20\'1Cbeing able to focus on what\u8217\'20\'19s in front of us now makes a massive difference when it comes to things like digitisation and open banking rules \u8212\'20\'14 if I can spend 80 per cent of my time on that instead of 30 per cent, you\u8217\'20\'19re in a much better position\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180521ee5l0030d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

These blended benchmarks were designed to match the risk profile of each hedge fund.\par \par \uc2 CEM found that hedge funds underperformed the simple benchmarks by an average of 127 basis points annually between 2000 and 2016 after fees were taken into account. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is hard to justify the typical fees charged by hedge funds if simple equity and debt blends outperform them,\u8221\'20\'1D said Alexander Beath, a senior analyst with CEM.\par \par \uc2 High fees destroyed the alpha [superior returns] that hedge fund managers produced. Hedge funds delivered an average of 145bp of outperformance annually compared with their benchmarks before fees but this fell to -127bp after costs.\par \par \uc2 CEM also found that hedge funds failed to provide protection to investors when it was needed most \u8212\'20\'14 during the financial crisis. In 2008 hedge funds, on average, underperformed the CEM benchmarks by 6 percentage points after fees, the worst result in the 17-year analysis.\par \par \uc2 The consultancy also examined the diversified hedge fund portfolios invested by large asset owners, including pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, and found 64 per cent underperformed their custom benchmarks iin 2000-16.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is not widely understood, even among sophisticated investors, that it is possible to buy alternatives to hedge funds that deliver similar risk and return characteristics at very low cost,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Beath.\par \par \uc2 A few leading US public pension schemes, notably the \uc2 California Public Employees\u8217\'20\'19 Retirement System\uc2  and the \uc2 New York City Employees\u8217\'20\'19 Retirement System\uc2 , have dumped or reduced their hedge-fund portfolios after repeated performance disappointments.\par \par \uc2 Many large investors have remained loyal, however. As a result, assets run by hedge fund managers have more than doubled in size since the financial crisis, up from $1.4tn at the end of 2008 to about $3.2tn.\par \par \uc2 The club of the largest investors \u8212\'20\'14 those with more than $1bn invested in hedge funds \u8212\'20\'14 expanded to 242 by May 2017 from 227 in 2015, according to Preqin, the data provider. The $1bn investor club member typically holds 29 hedge funds in their portfolios. \u8220\'20\'1CDespite some prominent departures, large investors continued to build significant portfolios of hedge funds in 2017,\u8221\'20\'1D said Amy Bensted, head of hedge fund products at Preqin.\par \par \uc2 Some of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most successful hedge funds have closed their doors to new investors because of capacity constraints, prompting a search for clones.\par \par \uc2 Markov Processes International\uc2 , a New Jersey quantitative research and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provider, has constructed indices that track the performance of elite hedge funds which can be replicated by low-cost exchange traded funds.\par \par \uc2 Its newest benchmark, the MPI Barclay Elite Systematic Traders index, aims to capture the returns of the 20 largest quantitative hedge fund managers that can be tracked via ETFs.\par \par \uc2 Rohtas Handa, MPI\u8217\'20\'19s head of institutional solutions, said: \u8220\'20\'1CInvestors look to hedge funds for diversification but this does not have to be expensive. The new investable tracker indices could replace the core of investors\u8217\'20\'19 hedge fund portfolios, allowing them to increase their allocations to managers that have an ability to provide novel returns.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180521ee5l0008k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

There are still outstanding regulatory issues, particularly around consumer protection, but they are no longer the priority.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A senior executive at one British bank said that \u8220\'20\'1Cbeing able to focus on what\u8217\'20\'19s in front of us now makes a massive difference when it comes to things like digitisation and open banking rules \u8212\'20\'14 if I can spend 80 per cent of my time on that instead of 30 per cent, you\u8217\'20\'19re in a much better position\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Letter in response to this article:\par \par \uc2 Banks have their own IT skills to tap into / From Johan den Haan, Rotterdam, the Netherlands\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020180521ee5l0035x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

One of these is the "deskless workforce," or technology designed to help remote workers.\par \par \uc2 Emergence also has a strategy around "coaching networks," which they describe as \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  that analyzes worker habits and helps them become more productive. Augmented writing platform \uc2 Textio\uc2  and sales assistance startup Chorus.ai are examples in this category.\par \par \uc2 "We helped to create the whole cloud-software investment strategy," Mr. Ritter said. He said is now focused on the idea that AI "will affect software."\par \par \uc2 Other portfolio companies that Emergence is touting include Zoom, Gusto and \uc2 Bill.com\uc2 . Emergence says it since it was founded in 2003, it has invested in nine companies that went on to achieve valuations above $1 billion.\par \par \uc2 The San Mateo, Calif.-based firm makes just five to seven investments a year, typically cutting checks around $5 million or $10 million for the Series A stage.\par \par \uc2 Most of these companies have been in the San Francisco Bay Area, but these days Emergence is looking across the U.S. As many as half of Emergence's recent investments have been outside the Bay Area.\par \par \uc2 When asked how they plan to differentiate themselves from the numerous other Series A firms, Mr. Ritter said his partners aren't overworked, so they have more time for hands-on guidance, adding, "We keep our board load appropriate."\par \par \uc2 Write to Katie Roof at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:katie.roof@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 katie.roof@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180521ee5l00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A decade after the financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. Today, we spotlight Moody's CEO Raymond McDaniel Jr. and former Merrill Lynch banker Christopher Ricciardi.\par \par \uc2 Moody's Corp. Chief Executive \uc2 Raymond McDaniel Jr\uc2 . has been guiding the credit-ratings firm into new opportunities. But after weathering criticism for giving lofty ratings to debt that collapsed during the financial crisis, his firm still relies on its core ratings unit for the bulk of its revenue.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, Mr. McDaniel has been diversifying \uc2 Moody's\uc2  business with a greater focus on data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . This strategy reached a new height last year, with the $3.5 billion purchase of \uc2 Bureau van Dijk\uc2 , a Dutch financial-information provider, the biggest acquisition in the firm's history.\par \par \uc2 Moody's\uc2  has made investments in technology startups focusing on real estate, such as CompStak and Rockport VAL last year. Revenue in its \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business hit a new high in 2017.\par \par \uc2 But in some ways, not much has changed since the housing- and financial-market collapse in 2008. Despite calls by lawmakers and others to break up the trio of firms that dominates the bond-rating business, investors and companies continue to overwhelmingly rely on \uc2 S&P Global Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  and \uc2 Moody's\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The firm's bond-rating unit also reported record revenue of $2.8 billion in 2017, which accounted for about two-thirds of its total revenue.\par \par \uc2 A lawyer by training, Mr. McDaniel, 60 years old, has led \uc2 Moody's\uc2  since 2004 and has spent decades at the firm. A spokesman said Mr. McDaniel declined to comment for this article.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, Mr. McDaniel testified on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers hammered him on whether the quality of \uc2 Moody's\uc2  ratings fell in the years leading up to the housing market's collapse.\par \par \uc2 "I care about market share. I also care deeply about ratings quality," Mr. McDaniel said at the time. He added he was "deeply disappointed" at mortgage-related bonds' performance, but said his firm didn't let standards slide to attain market share.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180519000094"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180519ee5j0002i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A decade after the financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. Today, we spotlight Moody's CEO Raymond McDaniel Jr. and former Merrill Lynch banker Christopher Ricciardi.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Ricciardi, a former Merrill Lynch banker, was known as the "grandfather of CDOs" for helping popularize these complex structured products that blew up during the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Now, he is bringing his experience to another corner of the financial world with mounds of debt: student loans.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ricciardi joined the Andover, Mass.-based investment firm FlowPoint Capital Partners LP as a partner last year. The firm's investment strategy relies in part on buying a product known as income share agreements, or ISAs. Under these, college students agree to give up part of their future income for a certain period in exchange for payments to cover all or part of their tuition. These products are meant to be an alternative to a student loan.\par \par \uc2 Charles Trafton, managing partner at FlowPoint, said Mr. Ricciardi is helping with the creation of what they call a new asset class. Mr. Trafton said the firm is trying to create a market for higher education by determining the true value of a college degree, factoring in variables such as a student's school and major. Students repay as much as double the amount of the tuition fronted, he said. Mr. Ricciardi's "skills in helping create new asset classes and skills in securitization are really helpful," Mr. Trafton said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ricciardi was a financial pioneer who bundled asset-backed securities into pools called collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, which were then sliced into tranches of varying risk. From 2003 to 2006, he helped transform Merrill from bit player to powerhouse in this lucrative business. The company leapt from 15th place among CDO-underwriting ranks in 2002 to the No. 1 spot on Wall Street in 2004. Merrill's underwriting total soared to $35 billion in 2005, of which $14 billion were backed mostly by securities tied to subprime mortgages -- the debt whose blowup sparked the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ricciardi the following year jumped to \uc2 Cohen & Co\uc2 . After 18 months, Cohen's assets under management quadrupled to $40 billion. But the value of many of the CDOs began to falter in 2007 as mortgage delinquencies rose.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ricciardi, 49 years old, declined to be interviewed, though he answered some questions in writing. He said he objected to how media reports have portrayed his role during the crisis. "Sells papers I guess," he said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Janet Tavakoli\uc2 , founder of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a consulting firm that has done work on CDOs, said Mr. Ricciardi was a key figure in "one of several problems that led to the crisis."\par \par \uc2 After leaving Cohen in 2010, Mr. Ricciardi helped launch Mead Park Management LLC, a hedge fund that focused on selling collateralized loan obligations, a subset of CDOs. Mead Park is no longer in operation; Mr. Ricciardi said in an email that he left in October.\par \par \uc2 In addition, he founded PLAAY Sports, a sports-video-editing company using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Mr. Ricciardi said in another email.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180519000093"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180519ee5j0002h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Dear readers,\par \par \uc2 Here in Silicon Valley, we tried and\u160\'00\'A0failed\u160\'00\'A0to shed a tear for \uc2 Facebook\uc2  or Theranos. Both retain the unstinting, unreasoning, undeserved support of \uc2 Tim Draper\uc2 , a local venture capitalist who thinks the government should stop \u8220\'20\'1Cpicking on\u8221\'20\'1D the social media company and journalists should stop writing mean things about the blood-testing start-up, even though the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  has now deemed it a \u8220\'20\'1Cmassive fraud\u8221\'20\'1D. We did manage some heartfelt sympathy for Rupert Murdoch, though, who\u160\'00\'A0lost\u160\'00\'A0a bundle of money on Theranos thanks, in part, to the enterprising work of one of his own\u160\'00\'A0reporters.\par \par \uc2 I don\u8217\'20\'19t know what the German for schadenfreude is but, anyway,\u160\'00\'A0there is none on display at \uc2 easyJet\uc2 , the budget airline\u160\'00\'A0profiting from the demise of \uc2 Air Berlin\uc2 , from which it purchased slots at Tegel airport. However, \uc2 easyJet\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0shares are showing signs of altitude sickness at 16 times forward earnings, the highest valuation among its European peers. Labour productivity is weak, cost control is no better than \uc2 Ryanair\uc2  and that \uc2 Air Berlin\uc2  slot win is rather distorting capacity metrics.\par \par \uc2 The lack of candour around the departure of\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Martin Sorrell\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0from \uc2 WPP\uc2  is quite remarkable. Proxy adviser Glass Lewis thinks it should cost the job of chairman \uc2 Roberto Quarta\uc2 ; shareholders will get a vote next month. On the one hand, those shareholders have enjoyed a double-digit percentage gain since Sir Martin bade his mysterious farewell. On the other, that pop is mainly on hopes that a lucrative break-up may follow on from the founder\u8217\'20\'19s departure.\par \par \uc2 For questionable leadership, though, \uc2 WPP\uc2  cannot compete with\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Xerox\uc2 , which really lowers\u160\'00\'A0the toner. The copier company announced a merger with Fuji of Japan, bitterly contested by the US company\u8217\'20\'19s activist shareholders \uc2 Carl Icahn\uc2  and Darwin Deason. Mr Deason sued. A New York court concluded chief executive \uc2 Jeff Jacobson\uc2  was \u8220\'20\'1Chopelessly conflicted\u8221\'20\'1D in negotiating the deal. He had been told by his chairman that he was likely to be replaced but proceeded with the transaction. Then \uc2 Xerox\uc2  settled with the activists and Mr Jacobson agreed to step down. Then \uc2 Xerox\uc2  reversed that decision. Then it fired Mr Jacobson anyway. Given the glaring ineptitude of \uc2 Xerox\uc2 , we wondered instead about the tactics of the activists: why not just concentrate on winning the shareholder vote on the Fuji deal and avoid all the drama? Now it is their\u160\'00\'A0problem. Aged 82, Mr Icahn has to hawk photocopiers.\par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Facebook\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  informed an ignorant member of Congress during one of his recent sessions being \u8220\'20\'1Cpicked on\u8221\'20\'1D, China has internet companies too.\u160\'00\'A0Tencent results\u160\'00\'A0this week showed revenue growth rattling along at 48 per cent a year in the first quarter to Rmb73.5bn ($11.5bn). Churlishly, we warned that investors should look at dwindling operating margins, weighed down by loosely defined \u8220\'20\'1Cother\u8221\'20\'1D business units, whose revenue is no more than a fifth of the total.\par \par \uc2 The UK and US diverged this week in gambling rules. The \uc2 UK government\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0cut sharply\u160\'00\'A0the amount that can be wagered at fixed-odds betting terminals from \u163\'00\'A3100 to \u163\'00\'A32, with concerns over addiction outweighing the tax hit. The \uc2 US Supreme Court\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0ruled\u160\'00\'A0that a law preventing states from allowing sports betting was unconstitutional. In aggregate, this might seem bad news for UK gambling groups but that is not the case: the UK clampdown was priced in while UK groups such as \uc2 William Hill\uc2  have been laying the groundwork for several years for a dash for growth in the US. \uc2 William Hill\uc2  still needs a lot of restructuring \u8212\'20\'14 and a private equity bid remains possible. Even if it has cleverly positioned itself in Nevada and New Jersey, it may need to shed stores in Norwich and Nuneaton.\par \par \uc2 I wish you a winning weekend,\par \par \uc2 Tom Braithwaite\par \par \uc2 Lex writer\par \par \uc2 Best of Lex articles\par \par \uc2 * Silicon Valley: it\u8217\'20\'19s not fair!\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 EasyJet\uc2 : ich bin ein barnstormer\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 WPP\uc2 : a Sorrell state\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 Xerox\uc2 : Re-fuji status\par \par \uc2 * Tencent: peaking duck\par \par \uc2 * Bookmakers: \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\par \par \uc2 * US sports betting: grow your own dopes\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180518ee5i004v1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

He learned about restaurants's challenges while he was running Clover, which distributed point-of-sale devices to restaurants.\par \par \uc2 The oven uses cameras and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to recognize foods, then uses radio frequency waves to simultaneously cook different foods in the oven to each item's optimal temperature.\par \par \uc2 The Palo Alto, Calif., company is targeting establishments that don't have space for a large commercial oven or those that don't have a kitchen, such as airports, coffee shops, hotels, universities, cafeterias or convenience stores. Markov is testing with some of these corporate customers.\par \par \uc2 This type of technology can upend traditional appliance manufacturers that just focus on hardware and don't have expertise in software, Mr. Speiser said. Since the Level is controlled by software, the company continually makes improvements and pushes new software to the devices, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Our belief is we want the appliance to operate 10 times better," Mr. Speiser said. "You don't have to think about it and it's reliable. That's the magic of automation. It does tedious, boring tasks you don't want to do, day in and day out."\par \par \uc2 Markov could eventually sell to consumers, as prices come down, like the Keurig coffee machines, said Mr. Speiser.\par \par \uc2 His company isn't alone in creating AI for ovens. June Life Inc., which has raised about $61 million from Founders Fund and others, has gone direct to consumers with its $1,500 device.\par \par \uc2 A number of startups and large companies are attempting to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/robotic-chefs-arrive-in-restaurant-industry-1507203001"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 automate }}}\uc2 the food preparation and delivery industry. Devices like June could help facilitate that, Mr. Speiser said. "This is what will allow them to do it economically (without) building huge facilities," he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Tomio Geron at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:tomio.geron@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tomio.geron@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180517ee5h0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Howard Lutnick's Newmark Group Inc. poached a senior hotel sales and financing team from rival Eastdil Secured in Newmark's biggest talent grab since its initial public offering in December.\par \par \uc2 The group, including Eastdil managing directors Adam Etra, Mark Schoenholtz, \uc2 Lawrence Wolfe\uc2  and Miles Spencer, will run Newmark's hotel capital-markets group. They have been responsible for lodging transactions in the eastern half of the U.S. for Eastdil and have worked on such high-profile transactions as the $90 million sale of Miami Beach's Setai Hotel and Anbang Insurance Group Co.'s $1.95 billion purchase of the Waldorf Astoria New York from \uc2 Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc\uc2 ., both in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Newmark went public as part of a spinoff from Mr. Lutnick's financial-services firm, \uc2 BGC Partners Inc\uc2 . The real-estate firm, which had about $1.6 billion in revenue in 2017, has been on a growth binge since BGC acquired it in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Newmark's recruitment of the Eastdil team shows that the firm has no plans to slow down its growth plans in the wake of the IPO, which gave it currency to use for acquisitions and talent. Newmark is predicting its 2018 revenue will be between $1.9 billion and $2.05 billion.\par \par \uc2 "The pipeline is pretty full in terms of acquisitions," \uc2 Barry Gosin\uc2 , Newmark's chief executive, said in an interview Monday. "We're aggressive in pursuit of growth."\par \par \uc2 The move of the hotel group marks Eastdil's second loss of a high-profile team in less than two years. The niche firm, which specializes in sales and refinancing, lost a group led by Douglas Harmon and Adam Spies to \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield Inc\uc2 . in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Members of the Eastdil team who are making the move to Newmark said they are moving partly for the opportunity to build a business from the ground up. They said Messrs. Lutnick and Gosin are committed to investing sufficient capital to build a world-class hotel sales group.\par \par \uc2 They "created an opportunity that was too good to pass up," said Mr. Schoenholtz.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Easdil didn't respond to a request to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lutnick is Newmark's chairman and BGC's controlling shareholder. He is best known as the chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald LP, which he rebuilt after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when the firm lost 658 employees in the World Trade Center.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 1929, Newmark is striving to be one of the world's largest commercial real-estate-services firms, on par with such giants as \uc2 CBRE Group Inc\uc2 . and JLL. The industry has been consolidating in recent years as cross-border capital flows have surged and property owners increasingly have looked for brokers who can tap buyers, partners and lenders in other countries.\par \par \uc2 Other firms jockeying for position include \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield\uc2 , which was acquired by a group led by private-equity firm TPG in 2015. Cushman, which has been combined with other firms, is widely expected to launch an initial public offering this year. A spokesman for Cushman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The hotel sales business has been choppy in recent years, partly because of investor concern about competition from online lodging services such as \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 . Investors purchased $28.2 billion of U.S. hotels in 2017, compared with $36.4 billion in 2016, according to data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So far this year, the hotel market is off to a strong start. Investors purchased $10.9 billion of property, compared with $6.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 Two big portfolio deals accounted for half of the volume, Real Capital said. Meanwhile, interest in the lodging sector also is being fueled this year by the effort announced in March by \uc2 Pebblebrook Hotel Trust\uc2  to acquire \uc2 LaSalle Hotel Properties\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Newmark sold its stock to the public at $14 a share in December. It fell seven cents, or 0.5%, to $14.49 Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Newmark's spinoff from BGC won't be complete until Newmark repays about $800 million in debt that BGC took on to acquire Berkeley Point, a financing firm now part of Newmark. Newmark is planning to borrow to repay BGC, but it first needs to get its own credit rating.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20180516000055"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020180516ee5g0001c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 U.K. growth investor \uc2 Vitruvian Partners\uc2  has completed an investment in fast-growing cybersecurity company \uc2 Darktrace Ltd\uc2 ., according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The London-based firm bought a small minority stake in an off-market transaction from existing \uc2 Darktrace\uc2  investors, one of the people said, adding that the deal was concluded last month. The deal valued \uc2 Darktrace\uc2  at $1.25 billion, according to a different person. The identity of the sellers couldn't be determined.\par \par \uc2 Vitruvian paid a higher price for the shares than the valuation of shares \uc2 Darktrace\uc2  sold in a 2017 funding round. At that time, the company raised $75 million from investors that included \uc2 Insight Venture Partners\uc2 , \uc2 Summit Partners\uc2 , \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . and TenEleven Ventures. That 2017 funding round valued the company at $825 million, a person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Darktrace\uc2 's website lists other early VC backers including \uc2 Talis Capital\uc2 , Invoke Capital and Hoxton Ventures.\par \par \uc2 Darktrace\uc2 , which has dual headquarters in Cambridge, U.K., and San Francisco, sells software that uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to respond to unusual activity on computer networks without direct human intervention.\par \par \uc2 In its most recent results, for the year through June 30, 2017, \uc2 Darktrace\uc2  said turnover rose 80% to \u163\'00\'A330.8 million from \u163\'00\'A317.1 million the prior year. The company said its operating loss widened to \u163\'00\'A324.4 million from \u163\'00\'A39.6 million primarily due to the cost of hiring research-and-development and sales staff. \uc2 Darktrace\uc2  has 620 employees, led by Chief Executive Officer Nicole Eagan, according to its website.\par \par \uc2 Demand for cybersecurity products is surging thanks to tightening regulations and high-profile security breaches. Research firm \uc2 Gartner Inc\uc2 . forecasts that global spending on enterprise security will reach $96.3 billion in 2018, an 8% increase from 2017.\par \par \uc2 The investment isn't Vitruvian's first effort to profit from the trend. In December the private-equity firm acquired a 30% stake in Romanian security software company \uc2 Bitdefender SRL\uc2  for $180 million, according to a statement released by \uc2 Bitdefender\uc2 . Last year it also acquired CFC Underwriting Ltd., an insurance broker that specializes in niche markets such as cyberrisk.\par \par \uc2 Vitruvian announced the close of its third fund on its{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vitruvian-closes-2-7-billion-third-fund-in-under-two-months-1498750605?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=19"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  \u8364\'20\'AC2.4 billion hard cap }}}\uc2 last June.

This could lead to new precision treatments for specific groups of cancer and autoimmune disease patients.\par \par \uc2 Initial diseases of interest include melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and the autoimmune condition inflammatory bowel disease, said Christoph Lengauer, co-founder and president of Celsius and venture partner with Celsius backer \uc2 Third Rock Ventures\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Studying the genetics of specific illnesses could lead to insights into how to attack other conditions. For example, better understanding of how the immune system attacks the body's own tissue in inflammatory bowel disease could improve understanding of how to harness the immune system to fight colorectal cancer, according to Dr. Lengauer.\par \par \uc2 Cambridge, Mass.-based Celsius raised this Series A round from Third Rock, which led the financing, as well as \uc2 Alexandria Venture Investments\uc2 , Casdin Capital, GV, and Heritage Provider Network.\par \par \uc2 Write to Brian Gormley at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:brian.gormley@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 brian.gormley@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180515ee5f00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But perhaps surprisingly, some ETFs that employ environmental, social and governance metrics also hold gun companies, prompting questions about the rules governing these funds.\par \par \uc2 In response to investor concerns, \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest asset manager, decided to exclude firearms manufacturers and retailers from a range of six ESG-focused equity and bond ETFs.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s lead has not been followed by its competitors \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  and \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\uc2 , the second and third-largest players in the ETF industry. Both have said they will engage with gun companies but they remain under pressure to take more decisive action.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Federation of Teachers\uc2 , a union representing 1.7m members, said in April that pension schemes investing in tracker funds should demand new gun-free products. It has also urged pension fund trustees to consider divesting from all gun manufacturers.\par \par \uc2 Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI, a London-based consultancy, says the variety of ESG-focused ETFs now available meant that investors needed to look carefully at their underlying construction before making any commitment.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is no clear definition of what constitutes an ESG ETF and that has been a source of confusion for investors,\u8221\'20\'1D says Ms Fuhr.\par \par \uc2 Around $17.7bn is invested globally across 140 ESG-focused ETFs, according to ETFGI. These include \u8220\'20\'1Cthemed\u8221\'20\'1D funds that focus on clean energy, climate change, water investment strategies and gender diversity. However, the majority of invested assets sit in broader products that evaluate ESG metrics across entire stock markets.\par \par \uc2 Investor interest so far remains modest, with ESG-focused ETFs attracting net inflows of $4.2bn last year, compared with $3.7bn in 2016 \u8212\'20\'14 but is only a tiny fraction of the $654bn in new business registered by the ETFs globally in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Rory Tobin\uc2 , global head of ETFs for \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\uc2 , says investors accepted that ESG was \u8220\'20\'1Ca force for good\u8221\'20\'1D but uncertainty over definitions has led to wide variations in investor appetite for ESG across European markets.\par \par \uc2 The slow pace of adoption also reflects the mixed results of numerous studies of the links between ESG policies and the financial performance of companies.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe find that US investors are concerned that they will have to sacrifice performance and they are unable to quantify [how much],\u8221\'20\'1D notes Mr Tobin. \u8220\'20\'1CBut in Europe, we find that ESG is being used successfully by some wealth managers to attract younger investors and millennials who are concerned about environmental and social issues.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Loren Fox, director of research for Financial Times company Money-Media, says its data show 41 per cent of the largest US financial advisers used general ESG funds in 2017, up from 33 per cent in 2016, suggesting appetite for the theme is growing.\par \par \uc2 MSCI, the indices and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provider, added its voice to the debate in November. It examined 1,600 companies globally and found those with high ESG ratings reported higher profitability and dividend yields. They also demonstrated stronger risk management skills, which translated into higher market valuations. Evidence of improvements in ESG scores also served as a useful indicator of better future financial performance.\par \par \uc2 Nuveen, the $970bn US asset manager, has worked with MSCI to create customised ESG indices for ETFs. These take account of steps that companies are taking to improve their ESG scores and include additional carbon metrics that measure exposures to the threat of climate change.\par \par \uc2 Martin Kremenstein\uc2 , Nuveen\u8217\'20\'19s head of ETFs, says: \u8220\'20\'1CWe aimed to provide investors with ETFs that have been built using a consistent methodology.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Camilla Ritchie uses a range of ESG-focused ETFs in the sustainable investment portfolios that she runs at 7IM, the London-based wealth manager. \u8220\'20\'1CI mainly use regional equity ESG ETFs and often ask providers if they are planning any new launches as more product innovation would be helpful to sustainable investment portfolio managers,\u8221\'20\'1D says Ms Ritchie.\par \par \uc2 Mr Kremenstein says the historic criticism that ESG required investors to surrender returns in order to feel good about their portfolio was now being widely questioned.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis criticism is no longer true as ESG-based ETFs can deliver risk-adjusted rewards comparable to conventional market capitalisation-weighted ETFs.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020180514ee5e000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The rapid diffusion of cyber capabilities in the criminal underworld will make the fight even more challenging.\par \par \uc2 Criminal use of cyber tools and channels is on the increase. Moreover, it is becoming even easier for conventional gangs to access specialist expertise, with cyber crime increasingly being offered as a service. This means you do not have to be a hacker, you can hire one; you do not have to own a network of clandestine "mule" accounts to covertly move money around the system, you can just rent them by the hour, known as "payas-you-flow".\par \par \uc2 The shift to online banking and payments is giving organised criminal groups access to a vast and growing treasure trove of ways to exploit the system and reduce their own risk. The weakest brick in the wall each time becomes a target entry point for access.\par \par \uc2 Banks have been redoubling efforts to meet these challenges, spending billions of dollars annually to counter money laundering and terrorist finance. Since 2012, the bank I lead has seen a nearly 10-fold increase in annual spending on financial crime compliance, and a more than seven-fold increase in headcount. While these investments have improved our defences, it is becoming clear that throwing money at the problem will not be enough to solve it; we need better ideas.\par \par \uc2 I see three areas that offer a possible breakthrough in how we fight financial crime. First, banks need to raise their technology game. Right now, 99 per cent of the financial crime alerts are false positives. Of the remaining 1 per cent, \uc2 Europol\uc2  estimates that no more than one-tenth are likely to be useful to law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 Counter-intuitively, getting this right could mean gathering more data, not less. New \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  technologies will allow financial institutions to evaluate vast quantities of data more quickly and fine tune our surveillance tools. That will free experts up to investigate truly suspicious patterns of behaviour and transactions. But regulatory support for these innovations is vital to achieve the scale and pace required to drive real change.\par \par \uc2 Second, the intersection of cyber crime and financial crime requires special focus. Specialists in cyber and financial crime must work together better. At \uc2 Standard Chartered\uc2 , we have created an integrated "CyFi" intelligence unit. We are also working with US and UK law enforcement and developing powerful new cyber tools of our own. We are mapping virtual currency use to spot bad actors attempting to breach the financial system's conventional defences and building new profiles using the digital fingerprints criminals leave behind.\par \par \uc2 Third, we need to do a better job of connecting governments and the financial system. Criminals operate across borders and banks and watchdogs see only a fragment of the picture. New information-sharing partnerships on financial crime are already producing breakthroughs that would have been impossible only a few years ago.\par \par \uc2 But we can only really succeed when all major financial centres adopt legislation that allows us to share financial information rapidly when necessary. We already benefit from doing so in the US and UK under existing laws. We also need their governments to trust us and prioritise working with us.\par \par \uc2 This year could be a pivotal one in the fight against financial crime: the people, technology and partnerships are in place. The bad guys are not standing still. Neither should we.\par \par \uc2 The writer is chief executive of Standard Chartered\par \par \uc2 Money laundering is being offered as a service, and gangs find it easy to hire financial expertise\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180514ee5e00020\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But perhaps surprisingly, some ETFs that employ environmental, social and governance metrics also hold gun companies, prompting questions about the rules governing these funds.\par \par \uc2 In response to investor concerns, \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world's largest asset manager, decided to exclude firearms manufacturers and retailers from a range of six ESG-focused equity and bond ETFs.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's lead has not been followed by its competitors \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  and \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\uc2 , the second and third-largest players in the ETF industry. Both have said they will engage with gun companies but they remain under pressure to take more decisive action.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Federation of Teachers\uc2 , a union representing 1.7m members, said in April that pension schemes investing in tracker funds should demand new gun-free products. It has also urged pension fund trustees to consider divesting from all gun manufacturers.\par \par \uc2 Deborah Fuhr\uc2 , co-founder of ETFGI, a London-based consultancy, says the variety of ESG-focused ETFs now available meant that investors needed to look carefully at their underlying construction before making any commitment.\par \par \uc2 "There is no clear definition of what constitutes an ESG ETF and that has been a source of confusion for investors," says Ms Fuhr.\par \par \uc2 Around $17.7bn is invested globally across 140 ESG-focused ETFs, according to ETFGI. These include "themed" funds that focus on clean energy, climate change, water investment strategies and gender diversity. However, the majority of invested assets sit in broader products that evaluate ESG metrics across entire stock markets.\par \par \uc2 Investor interest so far remains modest, with ESG-focused ETFs attracting net inflows of $4.2bn last year, compared with $3.7bn in 2016 \u8212\'20\'14 but is only a tiny fraction of the $654bn in new business registered by the ETFs globally in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Rory Tobin\uc2 , global head of ETFs for \uc2 State Street Global Advisors\uc2 , says investors accepted that ESG was "a force for good" but uncertainty over definitions has led to wide variations in investor appetite for ESG across European markets.\par \par \uc2 The slow pace of adoption also reflects the mixed results of numerous studies of the links between ESG policies and the financial performance of companies.\par \par \uc2 "We find that US investors are concerned that they will have to sacrifice performance and they are unable to quantify [how much]," notes Mr Tobin. "But in Europe, we find that ESG is being used successfully by some wealth managers to attract younger investors and millennials who are concerned about environmental and social issues."\par \par \uc2 Loren Fox, director of research for Financial Times company Money-Media, says its data show 41 per cent of the largest US financial advisers used general ESG funds in 2017, up from 33 per cent in 2016, suggesting appetite for the theme is growing.\par \par \uc2 MSCI, the indices and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provider, added its voice to the debate in November. It examined 1,600 companies globally and found those with high ESG ratings reported higher profitability and dividend yields. They also demonstrated stronger risk management skills, which translated into higher market valuations. Evidence of improvements in ESG scores also served as a useful indicator of better future financial performance.\par \par \uc2 Nuveen, the $970bn US asset manager, has worked with MSCI to create customised ESG indices for ETFs. These take account of steps that companies are taking to improve their ESG scores and include additional carbon metrics that measure exposures to the threat of climate change. \uc2 Martin Kremenstein\uc2 , Nuveen's head of ETFs, says: "We aimed to provide investors with ETFs that have been built using a consistent methodology."\par \par \uc2 Camilla Ritchie uses a range of ESG-focused ETFs in the sustainable investment portfolios that she runs at 7IM, the London-based wealth manager. "I mainly use regional equity ESG ETFs and often ask providers if they are planning any new launches as more product innovation would be helpful to sustainable investment portfolio managers," says Ms Ritchie.\par \par \uc2 Mr Kremenstein says the historic criticism that ESG required investors to surrender returns in order to feel good about their portfolio was now being widely questioned.\par \par \uc2 "This criticism is no longer true as ESG-based ETFs can deliver riskadjusted rewards comparable to conventional market capitalisationweighted ETFs."\par \par \uc2 Some wealth managers are using ESG to attract younger investors\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180514ee5e000aa\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved \par \par \uc2 Automation is coming for investment bankers, too\par \par \uc2 COMPANIES that want to borrow money through capital markets have conventionally had only one option: hiring an investment bank. In exchange for a hefty fee, these intermediaries shepherd their clients through the long process of selling debt, producing reams of documentation and rounding up willing buyers. Perhaps the most important service they provide is estimating the price that the market will bear for a given firm's bonds. Historically, these calculations have been far from scientific: bankers typically sound out institutional investors to get a sense of their appetite for the bond, compare the would-be issuer's financial profile to those of similar borrowers, and settle on a final number largely by feel and intuition.\par \par \uc2 Overbond, a startup based in Toronto, is seeking to modernise this process using statistical forecasting methods. The company has developed an algorithm that estimates the price range a company is likely to command for its debt, a valuable tool for corporate treasurers. It also offers useful information to investors, by predicting when a firm is likely to issue its next new bond. Having started out in Canada, it is now expanding into America. In recent years automation has primarily taken away middle-skilled jobs. If companies like Overbond have their way, investment bankers may also see their ranks diminished.\par \par \uc2 Document ECOCOM0020180514ee5e00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Mayfield, \uc2 Norwest Venture Partners\uc2  and the venture arm of New York Presbyterian also contributed, bringing the company's total funding to $43 million.\par \par \uc2 "Health care systems can have the best physicians and equipment, but they can still be held back by how many different data systems they have to rely on," said Chief Executive Mudit Garg. "That complexity leads to haphazard decision-making that ultimately impacts patient care."\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2011, Qventus works with more than 60 hospitals across the United States including Stanford, Emory, New York Presbyterian and Sutter Health Network. Mr. Garg said the funding is planned for adding more capabilities to the software.\par \par \uc2 "There's obviously a lot of potential for AI and ML in health care, and Qventus really goes after the low-hanging fruit," said Bessemer Partner Stephen Kraus, who will join the company's board. "It's the most likely for health care systems to adopt because it's not threatening to any of the clinical staff."\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180514ee5e0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

"The rest of your supply chain hasn't caught up to that."\par \par \uc2 For example, Eero Inc. sells its home Wi-Fi system on its own website, on \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2  and in retail stores such as \uc2 Best Buy\uc2  and \uc2 Walmart\uc2 . Eero was tracking its inventory using Excel spreadsheets.\par \par \uc2 In the fall, Eero began using Alloy. Alloy has given his company better data about its inventory, which is essential when talking to retail partners, Eero Chief Executive Nick Weaver said.\par \par \uc2 "When we come to the table with data and information, it helps us build rapport and build credibility," Mr. Weaver said.\par \par \uc2 Menlo Ventures Partner \uc2 Matt Murphy\uc2 , an investor in \uc2 InsideSales.com\uc2 , said he was looking for other \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  companies and thought retail was attractive because so much money is at stake.\par \par \uc2 He said he courted Mr. Beal for two years before pre-emptively investing in Alloy, and even then other investors were breathing down his neck. "It's the most competitive it's ever been," Mr. Murphy said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Cat Zakrzewski at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180514ee5e0005m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The article focuses on the firms that provide alternative data sets to investment firms. Some of the most popular underlying data sets are massive pools of anonymised retail bank or investment account transactions, which are furnished by account aggregation companies \u8212\'20\'14 technology platforms that bring financial account information from disparate sources into one app or digital experience to create a holistic view of a consumer's finances . When consumers connect their financial accounts to a platform that uses aggregation \u8212\'20\'14 such as a personal finance app, robo-adviser or online lender \u8212\'20\'14 they are agreeing to give the third-party aggregator access to their financial data so that they can gain more transparency into their own financial life.\par \par \uc2 However, buried within some applications' terms of use, consumers may also be permitting the third-party aggregator to use their data for vague and various "\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 " purposes, such as compiling research for asset managers to inform their investment decisions. Although the data may be anonymised, it is hard to imagine that consumers would permit their data to be sold in such an opaque way, if given the choice.\par \par \uc2 A lack of transparency in finance was largely the impetus for the proliferation of account aggregation services to emerge , yet the monetisation of consumer data without clear, conspicuous consent contradicts that mission.\par \par \uc2 Consumers deserve to know who is handling their data and for what purpose.\par \par \uc2 Lowell Putnam Co-Founder and Chief Executive, Quovo, New York, NY, US\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180511ee5b0007o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Earnings per share also beat Wall Street estimates at $2.05.\par \par \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s shares had traded lower earlier this year over fears that it would be caught up in the wildly fluctuating demand for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum.\par \par \uc2 However, the stock had rallied strongly in the last two weeks, following good results from rival chipmaker AMD. \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  closed on Thursday at a new all-time high of $260.13, valuing the Silicon Valley company at $157.9bn.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  reported its results on Thursday, the stock fell by 2 per cent after-hours as investors opted to \u8220\'20\'1Csell the news\u8221\'20\'1D. It quickly recovered some of those losses, however.\par \par \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  predicted second-quarter revenues would be around $3.1bn, plus or minus two per cent, ahead of Wall Street\u8217\'20\'19s previous estimate of $2.9bn.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe had a strong quarter with growth across every platform,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Jensen Huang\uc2 , \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s founder and chief executive officer. \u8220\'20\'1COur datacentre business achieved another record and gaming remained strong.

China has responded with higher taxes for US exports (on stuff like soyabeans and other foodstuffs). Here\u8217\'20\'19s a list. Some analysts believe companies such as Tesla will be hurt the most, not Chinese groups.\par \par \uc2 But there is a much deeper rift underlying the tensions. Trump believes that China has been stealing and acquiring vital US technologies for decades through forced \u8220\'20\'1Ctechnology transfers\u8221\'20\'1D for US companies looking to enter the Chinese market (ie we give you\u160\'00\'A0market access, you give us your technology).\par \par \uc2 This means that this is just as much about soyabeans and American jobs as it is about billion-dollar chip deals, Chinese telecom companies in the US, and the future of China\u8217\'20\'19s domestic \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  capabilities. The situation now has the potential to disrupt the global technology supply chain.\par \par \uc2 In many ways this already looks like a hot war. Trump, for example, blocked \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s proposed $142bn takeover by Singapore-registered Broadcom on concerns that it might lead to reduced R&D spending by the US company, allowing China to steal a lead in 5G development.\par \par \uc2 At the start of the year the US also shut down \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s $1.1bn bid for US payments company MoneyGram over concerns that the buyer could \u8220\'20\'1Cweaponise\u8221\'20\'1D US citizens\u8217\'20\'19 personal financial data. The US has done its best to keep Chinese telecom equipment makers such as ZTE and \uc2 Huawei\uc2  off its soil.\par \par \uc2 At this point, the chances of Chinese acquisitions of sensitive US technology getting through the \uc2 Committee on\u160\'00\'A0Foreign Investment in the US\uc2 , the watchdog reviewing inbound investment for national security concerns, are slim.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you think you are going to have to file, the deal probably won\u8217\'20\'19t succeed,\u8221\'20\'1D said one US-based M&A lawyer about \uc2 Cfius\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Against that backdrop, it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t sound so crazy that Beijing could hold up or even torpedo\u160\'00\'A0a US private equity group\u8217\'20\'19s buyout of a Japanese chip business \u8212\'20\'14 what would be an unprecedented move on its part. It could also choose to tip over \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s\u160\'00\'A0$44bn acquisition of \uc2 NXP Semiconductors\uc2 ;\u160\'00\'A0Mofcom is the only global regulator holding up the deal.\par \par \uc2 China is clearly not sitting back and letting the US dictate the future development of its technology sector.\par \par \uc2 Lastly, a reminder that we look forward to seeing those of you who signed-up for our first DD event in London on Monday, May 14. Please do let us know if you can\u8217\'20\'19t make it, so we can let people in off the waiting list.

Moreover, by blasting the deal publicly,\u160\'00\'A0H\u246\'00\'F6ttges is trying to get the attention of European regulators who he hopes will make life complicated over the next year as \uc2 Vodafone\uc2  and \uc2 Liberty Global\uc2  try to get clearance.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 You won\u8217\'20\'19t be surprised to discover that \uc2 Vittorio Colao\uc2  reacted to the DT boss. The Vodafone chief executive said he was \u8220\'20\'1Camused\u8221\'20\'1D by his counterpart\u8217\'20\'19s comments given DT controls 70 per cent of sector revenue in Germany.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s bad news for him now there is a second national player,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI find his argument frankly self-serving.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Vodafone\uc2  has agreed to pay \uc2 Liberty Global\uc2  a break fee of\u160\'00\'A0\u8364\'20\'AC250m if the deal is blocked.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Nvidia Corp\uc2 . is scheduled to announce earnings for its first quarter after the market closes Thursday. Here's what to look for:\par \par \uc2 EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  to report per-share earnings of $1.47, according to a survey by \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2 , up 86% from the same quarter a year earlier. A year ago, the graphics-chip maker reported net income of $507 million.\par \par \uc2 REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect revenue of $2.91 billion, up 50% from a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 WHAT TO WATCH:\par \par \uc2 AI ASCENDANT: Global cloud-computing providers favor \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's high-end chips for some of their \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  calculations. In most quarters over the past two years, \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's sales to data-center customers such as \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . have ballooned by triple-digit percentages from the prior year. Analysts expect a high double-digit increase this time around\u8212\'20\'14slower, yes, but still growing at a torrid pace and from a higher base. \uc2 Kevin Cassidy\uc2  of \uc2 Stifel Financial Corp\uc2 . is looking for 65% growth from the previous year. "They're changing the industry in the data center," he said, "and that's the reason to own shares."\par \par \uc2 GAMING THE SYSTEM: Sales of gaming cards used in personal computers typically are weak in the first quarter, immediately following the holiday season. Nonetheless, many analysts believe \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's gaming revenue in the quarter grew by double digits from the previous year as \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  products command premium prices, and the gaming market continues to boom with help from cryptocurrency mining. Chris Caso of \uc2 Raymond James Financial Inc\uc2 . expects gaming revenue to have risen by as much as 68%. And he expects new gaming cards based on \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's latest Volta architecture to arrive this summer, driving further growth in the second half of the year.\par \par \uc2 MINING BOOM: Miners of the digital currency ethereum hold a wild card for \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 . The company sells a modified version of its gaming technology for cryptocurrency mining, but miners use its gaming cards as well. That has worried some investors, who believe such sales may be fleeting. Indeed, miners snapped up the supply of \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  game cards late last year, said Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC. They left more of the inventory for gamers in the first quarter, he said, and pent-up demand should be reflected in healthy results. Cryptocurrency could play a smaller role in \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's revenue going forward, though: The Chinese mining-hardware firm Bitmain Technologies Ltd. has said it expects later this year to offer products designed for ethereum mining from the ground up, potentially displacing graphics cards for that purpose.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ted Greenwald at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020180510ee5a0015p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

He discussed the Federal Reserve's interest-rate path, the economy, bank regulation, fiscal policy and other topics. GMU President \uc2 Angel Cabrera\uc2  moderated the discussion. Here is a transcript edited for length and clarity.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: I've been on the job about a hundred days, and I've spent a lot of time, obviously, digging in on the economy and on economics, but also digging into the district that we serve. We serve from South Carolina to Maryland, including West Virginia. That's the region that we cover.\par \par \uc2 I'm not new to the economy. I'm not new to the Fed. I was on the Atlanta board from 2009 to '14, and I spent 30 years at McKinsey, the consulting firm. And what I've done in my life has been working with firms to talk about what is happening, whether that be jobs \u8211\'20\'13 do they hire, do they fire? \u8211\'20\'13 compensation, and pricing. And so the stuff that we're doing in the Federal Reserve is pretty familiar to me.\par \par \uc2 My hope is I can walk into the (Federal Open Market Committee) room and bring something different. We have an unbelievable group of talent in that room. There's a bunch of Ph.D. economists, the best in the world, and these are guys that have been thinking about the macroeconomy forever. There are folks who have been in the bank regulation space, folks who have been in the policy space. But my hope is to bring something different, which is been in the management space. I'm the only person who has been in the management space there, and I do think there are opportunities to bring new insights and diverse perspectives from that.\par \par \uc2 Just to wet your whistle today, I was thinking maybe what I'd do is talk a little bit about what we see and what I see in the economy. I look at questions that what I see raises and how, you know, businesspeople tend to look at those. And after doing that, I'll give you a little bit of a tour. I look forward to hearing your questions, as well, at the end.\par \par \uc2 Before I start I should say, as we always say, that the views you're going to hear are mine and don't necessarily reflect those of my colleagues or the Federal Reserve \u8211\'20\'13 the Federal Open Market Committee in total. And so let me get to it.\par \par \uc2 Let me start with growth. To set the stage, real (gross domestic product) grew at about 2.6 percent last year. That's a notch above 2.2 percent, which has been the growth rate since the Great Recession. It grew at 2.3 percent in the first quarter. And most people project it to grow in the high 2 percent for the year.\par \par \uc2 What's behind that growth? I'd suggest to you the number one thing that's behind it unbelievably positive consumer and business confidence, all right? Consumers have jobs. They're looking at their income, they're looking at their stocks, and they feel good about spending. Consumer spending has been very strong. Businesses feel very strong. If you look at the business and consumer sentiment indexes that are out there, you'll see it about as high as it's been, right? So people have a lot of confidence. Business investment's been growing at 6 percent per year.\par \par \uc2 What's that driven by? It's driven by a bunch of things. Fiscal stimulus has helped, both the tax cut and the omnibus bill. A sense that we are deregulating has helped business confidence. The strength of the markets, of course, helps. The strength of the international economies has helped. And possibly just a sense that a bit of a hangover from the Great Recession is now behind us and people are looking forward to seeing some strength in the economy and feeling good.\par \par \uc2 There are, of course, risks. Our first quarter performance as an economy wasn't as good as the trend line. Some people say that stimulating the economy in the middle of an upturn isn't quite as significant an impact as stimulating it in the middle of a downturn. Market volatility is always a risk. Geopolitics are always a risk. I hear some businesses talk about supply chain constraints. And, of course, as we take \u8211\'20\'13 ramp risks up, that might dampen the economy and its growth as well.\par \par \uc2 Which then leads me to the first question, which is, you know, what do I think really has the most impact on business confidence? And here I'd start a conversation on tariffs. That's not so much because what's been announced has had \u8211\'20\'13 that is going to have that much direct impact. It's not clear what's going to be implemented in the end. Most economists feel that unless you have a broader trade war, you're not going to have that much impact. But there is an issue on business confidence. And the businesspeople that I talked to who were almost euphoric in January are now nervous, and they're nervous about where the macroeconomy is going, and they're nervous about what that'll do to their plans. I haven't heard any sense that folks are scaling back their plans, but I do hear people wondering where are we going and what are we \u8211\'20\'13 what are we doing. They're watching it quite closely.\par \par \uc2 So, on growth, we've got a good trajectory. It's strong. We have real confidence, and we have just a sense of watching and wondering what's going to happen next.\par \par \uc2 Let me turn to employment. The most bullish indicators come from the labor market. We've added more than 200,000 jobs a month over the last three months, which is a really strong number in a country with a low inherent population growth rate. Break-even, if you want to think about it like that, is probably, you know, in the realm of 100,000 a month or so.\par \par \uc2 The unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent last month. That's a good number \u8211\'20\'13 3.9 percent, the last time we saw that was around 2000. The last time before that was in the late '60s. The last time before that was around the Korean War. Right, you could imagine, if we continue to grow like we've been growing, unemployment going to places we haven't been for over 50 years, right?\par \par \uc2 I'm really interested in the strength of the hiring that's going on as well. The number of unfilled jobs today is actually higher than the number of people looking for work. Now, I don't know if that's happened in the \u8211\'20\'13 in the time that we've been tracking those indices. We are particularly short on tradespeople and on nurses, on truck drivers or bus drivers. And it just raises this interesting question of how could we be here where we have very low unemployment and even more jobs available. Why aren't they matching them? And part of the answer is there's still mismatches in the economy.\par \par \uc2 I've been in a lot of rural neighborhoods in our district, and unemployment in the rural areas is a lot higher than it is in the urban areas. I think Northern Virginia is in the mid-2s, right? The state of Virginia is in the low 4s. And the rest of it is in the non-urban part of Virginia. So people don't necessarily move to where the jobs are. You've got mobility issues there. And you've got skill mismatches, too. But, you know, we have an economy that's pretty tight and it's getting tighter. And one of the challenges that we look hard at is, you know, are we able to match those people to those jobs.\par \par \uc2 We were always taught, or at least I was always taught, that low unemployment ought to bring higher wages. And we are seeing some firming of wages, but we're really not seeing outsized wage pressure. Why isn't that? That's really the second question that you sort of try to probe with businesspeople.\par \par \uc2 When you talk to them, what you find is that their expectations are, like, you know, pretty well-anchored. They think anything more than 2 or 3 percent wage increases actually puts them at risk, right, from a competitive standpoint. They're trying to find ways to get around it. They're targeting wage increases to just a few people, not to the whole population. They're exploring alternatives like offshoring or outsourcing. They're trying to bring new people into the workforce. I talked to a firm that's relaxed its point of view on people with criminal records. They're delaying filling jobs. Or they're trying to invest in ways they haven't in years in retraining to qualify some of their people for different new jobs.\par \par \uc2 In the \u8211\'20\'13 in the late '90s and the mid-2000s when wage pressure was higher, there were firms that actually had to look at their entire workforce and say, wow, we've got to take the whole compensation curve up. And the reason they had to do it was really significant attrition. And while attrition's been creeping up, we're not yet seeing it go to the levels that will make people take a look at their entire workforce. So that's what we're looking hard at.\par \par \uc2 So a very strong employment market, but one without huge wage inflation.\par \par \uc2 Let's turn to inflation, overall price inflation. You may recall that last year there were several months in which inflation was unexpectedly low. In 2017 inflation was 1.7 percent. Core inflation was 1.5 percent. When you look at the more recent data, though, you see something different. Over the last 12 months, core inflation's been 1.9 percent. And in other words, over the last 12 months, it's essentially at our 2 percent target.\par \par \uc2 It does make you step back and ask the third question, which is you got a tight labor market, I haven't mentioned it but you have commodity price increases in places like oil and steel; why aren't we seeing more price inflation? And again, here I turn back to the behavior of firms. It may well happen in the longer term, but in the near term, you know, businesspeople say that their prices are a lot more driven by the markets they're in than their cost, right? To put it another way, there are certain markets where the market dynamics allow price increases \u8211\'20\'13 a lot of services, a lot of day-to-day goods, some places where you have big commodity price spikes. But if you're in a market or a place where you're selling through to the consumer, the numbers will show you it's very hard to take price increases, and it's been like that for 20 years.\par \par \uc2 You know, why is that? Well, you've got big retailers that just aren't interested in allowing you to take price increases, guys like \uc2 Walmart\uc2  or \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  . You've got the internet and Amazon and its role in making prices transparent, but also its role in helping new providers get access to the market. And you've got lower-cost providers in, you know, some offshore places who are able to manufacture and bring stuff onshore. And so all those things are challenging pricing there, and I think that's part of the reason you're not seeing more inflation.\par \par \uc2 So, for now, you know, inflation's stable. Again, it's something we're watching closely.\par \par \uc2 Which then turns us to monetary policy, and the question of how fast and how far the FOMC will raise interest rates. I'm not going to offer a prediction about how many increases are going to prove to be appropriate this year, but I did want to talk a bit about the underlying debate just to get your head around it.\par \par \uc2 First of all, we've been on a path of raising rates. What's the the case for raising rates? Well, one of them is monetary policy is still pretty accommodative. We still have our foot somewhat on the gas. And it's hard to argue that accommodation is appropriate when unemployment is low and inflation is effectively at our target. We probably ought to go to neutral in that environment rather than something else.\par \par \uc2 In addition, I think part of the reason inflation is under control is how credible we are in our commitment to step on the brake if we need to, right? So we don't want to risk our credibility of our commitment to low and stable inflation, so when the economy makes the call for removing accommodation because inflation's at target, labor markets are tight, and GDP's growing, we should probably follow through on that. And in the current robust environment, we don't see the risk of this as being significantly high.\par \par \uc2 Now, how high rates go depend a bit on growth in the underlying economy. The higher the underlying growth prospects, the higher rates can go. We're in a country that has pretty low demographic growth. The population is not going to grow very fast. I mean, five years from now it'll be about half a percent. There doesn't seem to be a trend towards increasing immigration, which is another way a population grows. And so you're highly dependent on productivity, which would be the fourth key question: How fast can we grow our productivity?\par \par \uc2 Now, if you look at the data over the last 20 or 30 years, you'll see we had a big boost in productivity from '95 to '05. But starting before the Great Recession, productivity came down almost by half, right? I think that's lower than the potential of American businesses, but you know, we just have to accept the picture right now that our productivity growth isn't where we need to have the kind of growth we want to have.\par \par \uc2 When I talk to businesspeople, they actually think they're growing productivity faster than the numbers would show. They talk about automation. They talk about investments they're making into capital \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). They talk about operating efficiencies. And so they actually think they're seeing more productivity, but the data doesn't support that. So maybe the data's accurate and they're wrong. Maybe the data hasn't yet caught up to what's happening. Maybe it's becoming less accurate over time. Or maybe it just takes some time for these investments to be realized. But this (is) an important part because if productivity rises, rates could go higher. You may be able to raise them, as we did in the '90s, a little bit slower. If productivity's lower, we risk pushing the economy past its potential and you start to have conversations about whether we're overheating or not. As a policy maker \u8211\'20\'13 a new policy maker, I can tell you it's a tight window to manage.\par \par \uc2 Of course, we're going to be looking at data over the next year or two and also talking in conversations with people who are in the district and what the data's telling us to try to guide the economy through these four questions on growth, on wage inflation, on price inflation, and on productivity. But I do want to leave you with the following thought. The economy's performance, as we sit here today, is remarkably strong: above-trend growth, low unemployment, inflation at target. For those of you who are seniors in here, I just want to say congratulations. You picked the right time to go into the job market. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: (Inaudible.) So you mentioned earlier how your profile is fairly different from a traditional profile of a (Fed official)\u8230\'20\'26For the most part you're economists or bankers\u8230\'20\'26But you're pretty much in the minority, right? Or is that not the case in terms of, like, having more of a business background?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Well, for \u8211\'20\'13 so we're all segments of one. And I think if we're going to make policy in this country, it's actually a really good idea to have diversity in the room on multiple dimensions. And, you know, one of the diversities I bring is I'm not a banker. I'm not an economist. I'm not a policy maker. I'm just a guy who was in business for 30 years. And I had an economics undergrad, so I should at least say stay in school or something like that \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 but \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). But I \u8211\'20\'13 you know, what I can bring is experience both in advising companies and in being, you know, the (chief financial officer, chief risk officer) and operator in our place of how do these real-world decisions get taken.\par \par \uc2 You know, for example, there was a tax cut that was announced at the end of last year. One of the big questions we had, you know, to debate is what kind of impact would the tax cut have. Well, I was the CFO of a sizeable corporation. You know, one of the things that is very clear to me is that no CFO in the world knows exactly what the benefit is of a corporate tax cut when it's made. It's unbelievably complicated. It's unbelievably arcane. Your tax accountants are going to work for months on it before you know it. And so when a lot of people are out there saying why aren't we seeing more investment spending really quickly after the tax cut, I could say, hey, wait a second, you know, most folks don't actually know what the impact's going to be yet, right? They're going to sort through and get at the impact. That's an example of where real-world experience perhaps helps, you know, bring a different perspective to the one \u8211\'20\'13 and again, I hope I give in the room. I know I learn a lot from these guys, and you know, maybe that will make us better.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: You mentioned the regulatory aspect. And I know you spent a fair amount of your time at McKinsey working with banks as a consultant, looking at how a system works, what makes them successful or less successful. And you were there, of course, during the last crisis, the 2008 period\u8230\'20\'26Now you're at the Fed. What do you think has changed in that time, if anything? What still needs to change?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: So I consulted in lots of industries. But actually my biggest exposure to banking was when I had the role at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\uc2  . And I was there from '09 to '14. And it was a pretty important part for the financial system. And my impression, first of all, is that the leadership that we had at that time in the Federal Reserve saved the business environment in this country. I was really very impressed as an outsider with the courage and the skill to keep, you know, complete cataclysm from happening. So that was very important and prescient.\par \par \uc2 And in that context, coming out of that for reasons that are perfectly understandable, we changed the regulatory model for banks. The banks in the system today have far more capital, far less leverage than they had before. I think that's a very important thing. We put in place the stress testing system. And for those who don't remember April '09 when we did the first stress test, we didn't know if all the banks would fail. We didn't know what we would find out. I actually think that stress test, in addition to giving the banks sort of an objective sense of whether they were in good shape or not, actually helped give the public assurance that the system's in good shape. And so we put the stress test in place, and a bunch of other things.\par \par \uc2 We're now in a slightly different world. It's 10 years later that we put the system in place. I do think the banks we have today are safe and secure. And we're now asking ourselves the question: All right, can we get all the same value for a little bit less cost, or a little bit less intensive a burden? And as a recovered consultant, I'm perfectly comfortable, you know, with that inquiry, right? Why wouldn't we ask whether we're getting everything done in the most efficient way possible? But I don't think we're changing the fundamentals of the regulatory framework we've put up there, which is to make sure we've got enough capital and enough liquidity in the banks. And in particular, the most important systemic banks, to your last question. And that we're doing in the way that's the most respectful of people's time and money.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: It sounds like large-scale banks, that's \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 with some constraints, but not made it difficult for them to function. And for the smaller ones, then that might be particularly difficult. Also, at the other end, we're talking about cross-border banking. Does that become harder? Are the other implications for those globally?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Yeah. So our smaller, community banks, we're very much focused on the safety and soundness of those banks as well. They really, for the most part, you know, are \u8211\'20\'13 haven't been part of some of the complexity of \u8211\'20\'13 that we saw back 10 years ago. But each and every one, you know, is \u8211\'20\'13 you know, where we work with very closely to get that done. You'll see in the recent bill that's currently in front of the House and Congress an effort to tailor regulation, to make sure we, you know, put our ammunition in the place that has got the biggest impact, and we streamline the places where it has less effect. That tailoring would be a good example of the kind of streamlining I'm talking about.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the international system, I mean, there's \u8211\'20\'13 there's just no question that what happened in international financial markets was very relevant to what happened to us back in 2008-2009. And you'll remember the time we spent as a country thinking about Greece or thinking about the German banks that had a lot of these collateralized mortgage applications on their books. And that's part of the reason why we support, you know, international regulatory frameworks that are consistent across countries. So I do think that when you got open markets, what happens in one place is going to affect everybody.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: How about monetary policy as a goal, or a changing goal? We see it over the years, that it's not always a consistent, you know, clear plain vanilla function, and something that is a tool. How is that changing? Is it changing? Should it be changing? Particularly, as you said in your talk, that some of what's happening is great. And there's a question should be moving to neutral. Monetary policy as a tool \u8211\'20\'13 not just in this but in other times, what should its scope be?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Well, I did a talk for our board a few weeks ago, because I studied economies quite intensively in the early '80s, and then went into business for 30 years, and I studied as well. And then I get to come back into it. And it's changed a ton. For example, transparency. We have long conversations in the Fed \u8211\'20\'13 at Federal Open Market Committee on the note that we send every month, the press conferences that the chairman gives. Thirty-five years ago, there was no note and there was no press conference. We didn't even announce what we did. We just went and did it, right? So there's a commitment to transparency and talking about the path that's fundamentally different.\par \par \uc2 In the early '80s, the theory of the case was that you advance the economy through managing the supply of money. You may remember M1, M2, and M3 \u8211\'20\'13 monetary aggregates. We switched years and years ago to targeting inflation. It's a very different \u8211\'20\'13 so that's just two examples that \u8211\'20\'13 and the point that I'd just make, that I've been so impressed with in the room, is everybody in there is a learner, right? it's not a \u8211\'20\'13 it's not a tic-tac-toe problem where after you've done it a few times you sort of figure out how to win or how to lose. It's an unbelievably complicated and endlessly varying problem, where the data is not accurate or isn't recent and the framework that you use to look at that data has to constantly evolve to incorporate what you've learned from before. And you make the best judgment you can in the interest of the country going forward.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, there are lots of people who have lots of different points of view. But there's no one person who is not a learner, and who is not willing stop and say: Let me test that against an alternative assumption. And you've got to be able \u8211\'20\'13 you've got to be able to do that, I think, to navigate what is fundamentally always unchartable territory.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: So it suggests that there is a certain amount of uncertainty built into the system that you can't avoid.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: There's massive uncertainty, right? What is going to happen in the next three months, six months? I try to give you a feel in my talk just of some of the risks that \u8211\'20\'13 simple risks that leap to mind. But you can pick up the paper any day and find an uncertainty that could affect the economy. It's interesting, you know, we're doing our best to manage under the uncertainty, while also doing our best to give those who are interested in what we're doing \u8211\'20\'13 people who invest in the future \u8211\'20\'13 a sense of where we think the world is going. But, you know, we always say we got to be dependent on what actually happens, because lots of stuff could happen between now and where we're going.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: So the current manifestation of this would be the tax \u8211\'20\'13 and you mentioned this and some of the positives you've seen lately. So if you maybe prognosticate it out, what's \u8211\'20\'13 what do you tell people?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: So two of three elements to the tax act that was passed in December. The first is there's a consumer tax cut in there. And a consumer tax cut is a pretty tried and true device, right, that does have some stimulative effect. It has a greater stimulative effect with lower-income folks than it does with higher-income folks. But even with higher-income folks, there's something people call a wealth effect. There's some amount of positive impact from a consumer tax cut. That has started to show up in people's pocketbooks in I think March. And, you know, we do expect that we'll be seeing some stimulative effect from the consumer art of the consumer part of the tax cut.\par \par \uc2 On the business, second big part of the tax cut is a corporate tax cut. That's got multiple pieces to it. It's a reduction in the corporate rate. It's an acceleration of depreciation on investments. And it's an incentive for repatriation of cash from offshore. That's a much harder one to guess what's going to happen. And I put myself back into the mind of the (chief financial officer) that I used to be and say: OK, you've got an interest in delivering earnings for the corporation. All of a sudden you get a windfall, right? How do you handle that windfall? Some of it you're undoubtable going to give back to shareholders of the company. By the way, that should have a wealth effect as they get wealthier.\par \par \uc2 Some of it you might on the margin be able to make some investments you weren't otherwise going to make. And we've certainly heard some stories about it. You might be pressured by your customers to give you some of that benefit back in price. And there are industries where it seems like that's happening more than other industries. And, you know, this might be the opportunity to address some of the labor compensation issues that we talked about in the tight labor market. So the question of how that all spreads out across those four areas, what they call climates, and what the stimulative effect is, I think is still to be told.\par \par \uc2 And I talk to businesses, we won't know maybe even into next year how people try to do it. I should then make a third point which is this all costs something, right? And if you look at the fiscal deficit, you project that out, (the \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  ) projects it going from the 3ish percent range to the 5ish percent range, total debt of the company \u8211\'20\'13 of the country going from the 70ish percent range into the 90is percent range over the next 10 years. And that is a challenge. And if you end up with a fiscal situation that's tighter, it means the next time you have a downturn you probably have less fiscal stimulus to throw into it. It means those folks who invest in our debt may require a higher yield to do it. And that has a dampening effect on the economy as well. So, you know, we also look very hard at the fiscal situation.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: So the first (question from the audience) is \u8230\'20\'26why have such a fixed (2% inflation) target, or should we have a range instead? And what are your thoughts about that? What's so magic about that 2 percent?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: So one of the things I did in preparation was just read a bunch of histories of the Federal Reserve because a lot of this happened before I got there. And it is interesting to try to figure out, you know, how you ended up there.\par \par \uc2 My understanding is that the first debate on the question of a target was in the mid '90s. And Janet Yellen \u8211\'20\'13 she was (then a Fed) board member, actually \u8211\'20\'13 was part of the task force \u8211\'20\'13 and I believe Al Broaddus, who's the former Richmond Bank president, was also on \u8211\'20\'13 to ask the question of what would be a reasonable target.\par \par \uc2 Part of the case that I've heard for 2 percent is that there are some biases in the inflation data. For example, you know, if you just introduced something that's brand new, it doesn't really get netted against \u8211\'20\'13 you can't compare it year over year to something from the year before because you didn't have it. And so there's some, if you will, deflationary bias, and some of that new. And 2 percent gives you a number that \u8211\'20\'13 you know, gives you a space to cover that kind of bias. But, you know, you can go back and forth. And they had a real full debate about 1, 2, 3, 2\u189\'00\'BD, 1\u189\'00\'BD, all that stuff.\par \par \uc2 Then, if you flash forward after the crisis, people did think it was important to give some notification, have some conversation about what we're really targeting and so, you know, we decided to go out and communicate a 2 percent target. That was \u8211\'20\'13 hadn't been communicated before. And that's a little bit about managing expectations for folks. There is a debate going on that you see in the press about should that 2 percent be arranged. If it's arranged, should it be a symmetric range. You know, I'm certainly intrigued by notions that talk about a range, because I'm not a big fan of what I call false precision, right? If you're at 1.9 or you're 2.1, are they \u8211\'20\'13 are you off of your target of 2 or are you at your target of 2? I tend to think that there's some standard interval around your target that's probably pretty OK, and so I kind of like notions that give you a standard interval sort of notion of range. But we'll be having that debate over the next year or two, and I think my mind is open on where we land that one.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: Interesting that in other parts of the world, right outside of the U.S., the mandate of the central bank would be just around price stability, right, and not so explicit. And the U.S. is a special case as far as it having economic growth that's the responsibility of the Fed.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: My memory, by the way \u8211\'20\'13 and again, please don't hold me accountable for this because I did a lot of reading over Christmas \u8211\'20\'13 but I believe that our original mandate did not include full employment, and that that was added in either the late '70s or early '80s by the Humphry-Hawkins Act that actually added that as a dual mandate. We live \u8211\'20\'13 you know, we're an act of Congress and we live according to that, so that's the \u8211\'20\'13 you know, that's what's been passed by Congress and that's what we look to.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: Well, this is (GMU) Professor (Steven) Pearlstein's question, is about the fact that obviously, as you mentioned earlier, the \uc2 Richmond Fed\uc2  was the prime regulator of \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  prior to the crisis, and there was considerable criticism that the bank's regulators were asleep at the switch. Do you still regard systematically important banks, and if \u8211\'20\'13 do you still regulate systematically important banks, and if so what reason do you have for confidence they won't miss the next one?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Well, let me answer that question maybe conceptually and then specifically\u8230\'20\'26So we are very serious about attacking the problems that came in the last crisis, and I would agree with you, there were lot of problems in the last crisis. You now see these banks, our biggest banks, other banks in the system with significantly more capital than they had before, significantly more scrutiny of their balance sheets, systemic vulnerability to shocks, and a wide variety of shocks.\par \par \uc2 I also come from the opinion that it's very rarely of the same problem twice in a row, and you always solve the last problem but not the next problem. And so we're also spending a lot of time trying to think hard about what's the problem we're not seeing. So I think that they did a lot on the problem we saw. And, you know, reasonable people could agree \u8211\'20\'13 disagree, but if you look at household debt levels today versus where they were 10 years ago and you look at the complexity of balance sheets, et cetera, et cetera, I think you'd see a sounder set of big banks.\par \par \uc2 But we're also trying to ask what's the next set of things. It is the shadow banking, you know, system and nonbanks? Is that something we need to pay attention to? Are there systemic connections between markets \u8211\'20\'13 you saw some stuff a few years ago in money market funds. So we're trying very hard to sort that out. And I'd say I haven't heard anything that makes me overly concerned, and that in and of itself just makes me nervous, because I kind of want to know \u8211\'20\'13 I want to know what I need to get concerned about\u8230\'20\'26You know, one thing we take very seriously that I might put on the table is cyber. And sort of thinking orthogonally what's the next thing that could be a challenge, I'd put that on the table, a foreign power freezing our financial \u8211\'20\'13 those sorts of things. And we're working very hard both in our day jobs as operators of very big payment systems and in our other day job as regulators of banks who run very big payment systems. So really upped the bar on ourselves and on them on our cyber preparedness for exactly that reason.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: A question about the quantitative easing. And I guess we saw after the crisis the Fed take these absolutely unprecedented steps, where it was just about (inaudible) the balance sheet and the Fed now buying hundreds of things that it didn't used to buy, like long-term bonds and mortgage-backed securities and things like that. And now there's a big announcement that we're going to get \u8211\'20\'13 we're going to start winding that down. Can we get out from that without causing a huge disturbance in the market?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Well, the FOMC, as you know, spent a lot of time trying to think about how to wind down the balance sheet. And we announced, I guess, in the third quarter last year our plan to do it. And we have been winding them down. We have been not repurchasing when things redeem up to a certain cap, and that cap has been increasingly quarter by quarter.\par \par \uc2 And I want to say \u8211\'20\'13 I think this is right \u8211\'20\'13 that our balance sheet is \u8211\'20\'13 by the end of the year might be as low as, like, a trillion dollars less than it was at its peak. So the balance sheet is coming down and it's coming down, you know, at a very measured pace. We do look hard about what's happening to the markets of late, and it doesn't look, as you see the market, like, you know, all of a sudden there's some big spike rates. In fact, maybe even the opposite. So I think we \u8211\'20\'13 where as we sit right now, we're reasonably comfortable that this notion of a measured path down is operating well.\par \par \uc2 And then we're going to have to get to the question of when are we done, right? Because there's a lot more currency in use today than there was when we started this thing, and so we're never going to as far down as we got before. At what point do we start to squeeze banks by having too little reserves in the system? And so we're taking it down, but we're also watching it very carefully. But I think if you're worried about that, at least my impression is there was a ton of really good work done by our teams in terms of thinking through how to do this in a measured fashion that wouldn't disrupt markets, and so far, so good.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: This is a McKinsey-ish question about industry structure and concentration. What we've seen is the latest announcement in cellphones with Sprint and T-Mobile announcing their potential merger. Of course, are all these concerns about Amazon having become this absolute giant in retail that dominates all over. I even watched a video recently of \uc2 Jeff Bezos\uc2  saying we fully expect now as this giant to draw out more scrutiny. But overall, this concentration of the economy, does it worry you in terms of rendering the economy that's competitive or causing bigger macroeconomic issues, in your view?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Tom (inaudible) taught a class when I was at business school called "The Coming of Managerial Capitalism." And the greatest case in that class \u8211\'20\'13 which must have been good if I can remember it 35 years later \u8211\'20\'13 was about the retail industry. They basically pointed out to, you know, 150 years of the retail industry in the U.S. And there was the general store, and then there was the butcher and the baker and the candlestick maker. And then at some point eventually you had, you know, a department store. And then you had Waldenbooks or B. Dalton Books that sort of took on the department store. And then you had the superstore, think \uc2 Toys R Us\uc2  or \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  , and then they got sort of beat by \uc2 Walmart\uc2  . And then, of course, you have the \u8211\'20\'13 you had Amazon as a bookseller, which took on those booksellers, and now you have Amazon as the department store, generally.\par \par \uc2 And the basic point that this case made is that, in the history of retail, you have consolidation and reconsolidation, consolidation and reconsolidation, and it's all around. And yet, every one of these things has made things cheaper for consumers, but it's about the ability to deliver value propositions and be able to deliver value at low price.\par \par \uc2 And so scale works great until somebody comes with a better, narrower mousetrap, and then they go deep on that. And I'm not informed enough to know what the next mousetrap is, but I'd say, in the world of retail, I really don't worry that there's not another mousetrap out there. I'm quite confident there is one. Maybe it's \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  enabled, maybe it's a new technology we don't know about, maybe it's virtual reality, but I think something will come and take on Amazon.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: Speaking of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , there is a Taylor rule question from a fourth-year Ph.D. student \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). But are you concerned (you might) lose your job to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 ? Like, we create these systems that are better than these 19 wise people at the FOMC making monetary policy decisions?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: I've already retired once, so I guess I'll be \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 fine if I lose my job.\par \par \uc2 So I'd put it like this. The technology exists right now in the airplane, right, for the airplane \u8211\'20\'13 for someone to press a button and the airplane will taxi down the runway, get in its thing, take off, fly to Chicago, land. You don't actually have to have a pilot in the airplane. The airplane can do it. And you guys know driverless cars, the same conversation is going on.\par \par \uc2 But no one wants to get in an airplane without somebody in the cockpit, right? And so I think we value a lot getting information from various algorithms and rules. Those things are talked about and looked at. And I feel it will be up to the country whether we just don't want to have anybody in the cockpit.\par \par \uc2 You know, if the answer came out \u8211\'20\'13 it comes out the computer and we go from there? I don't know, I don't think so.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: So I guess I let you off too easy on this concentration question I asked\u8230\'20\'26Or maybe it's just a follow up, which is, do you think that part of the reason why we're not seeing wage pressure and pressure on inflation is market concentration? Are employers more \u8211\'20\'13 have more power to keep wages down or \u8211\'20\'13 sorry, or import competition?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: OK, there's a lot in there, but I'll try to get at it. So, first of all, factually, if you look on a national org-level sense and you look at concentration industry by industry, you can find modest, not overwhelming, increases in concentration in those industries. There are places \u8211\'20\'13 airlines would be a good example \u8211\'20\'13 where they've gotten \u8211\'20\'13 U.S. airlines have gotten a lot more concentrated. And I think, as a result of that, have gotten a lot more pricing power. But by and large, we're talking about even decimals and points as opposed to going from 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 in certain industries.\par \par \uc2 As I've dug into it, as I've gotten a passion for this whole issue of firm behavior, I think when most folks talk about market concentration, they talk about it from a supplier side. And I really think it's more interesting to talk about it from a buyer's side, you know, what we used to call in the old days monopsony power.\par \par \uc2 I do think a big retailer \u8211\'20\'13 you know, think \uc2 Walmart\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 has the ability to hold down prices for the people supplying it, right? That's a pretty important piece of the puzzle. I also think that labor unions, which used to be a pretty big factor in negotiating price increases, are a lot weaker than they were 20 or 30 years ago, and so that's another issue. But I think about it much more on the monopsony side than on the monopoly side, if that makes sense.\par \par \uc2 The last thing I'll say is you mentioned international. When you have to think about market value, you have to think about it in the relevant market. So it's nice that someone has got 11 percent, you know, nationally, but if they've got 60 percent of your town, that might mean something. I'd say that the internet has opened a lot of that monopoly seller power, so that even if you're in a small town, you get access to the prices that the people in the big towns get, so that's, you know, a useful break from monopoly power.\par \par \uc2 I'll also say that the increasing globalization of business means that even unions in certain markets don't have the power that they used to because you could take jobs offshore, because you're competing in global markets, because you've got manufacturers in lower-cost countries who are bringing goods onshore. So the benefit is I do see a buying power piece of it, but honestly, I don't really see a pricing power impact, if that makes sense.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: Yeah. So here's a concern which I'm going to guess many citizens in your district and throughout the country probably have, which is wages are not growing, housing prices are; the sort of sense that, OK, there's sort of a mismatch between money in the pocket of a regular citizen and the real cost or the perceived real cost of living. There is the sense that the tax cut was going to have this trickle-down effect, if you will, but there is no evidence that employers are using whatever benefits might come from the tax cut to sort of increase wages. Is there anything the Fed can do to change this? I mean, I realize the Fed's powers are limited, but anything you can say to that ordinary citizen that feels the pinch?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Yeah. So I think the first place you're headed is right, which is that \u8211\'20\'13 and what has been for the last 10 years, a rising-tide kind of market. I don't think it's been an even-rising-tide market. And so there's been massive differences between those who have done the best and those who haven't had that. And while the average is good, that doesn't mean that everything is good.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, it was interesting just to drive through South Carolina, which is in our district, and reflect on the difference between being in Charleston, which is a tourist city and very \u8211\'20\'13 it has \u8211\'20\'13 it has a \uc2 Boeing\uc2  plant and has got a big port and is very thriving, and then driving up I-26 and going to Orangeburg, which, you know, you drive through the city and it's lots of poor people and it's very rough to get by.\par \par \uc2 And I've mentioned that with rural and urban before, I think there is something about, how could we as a citizenry, right \u8211\'20\'13 I want to make sure the opportunity comes to people regardless of where they sit. If I understand what you're doing at George Mason right, you're doing that. You're giving a lot of people, maybe first generation, an opportunity to get into school and get an education that makes sense and hopefully, you know, train people for good jobs, like those at the \uc2 Richmond Fed\uc2  . (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 But we should \u8211\'20\'13 I think we can do more. And one of the things that we're getting started on in our bank is \u8211\'20\'13 and, you know, different people do bring different things to the equation. We have a lot of money, but we can't bring money to the equation. We can, though, bring thought power. And our charter is around maximum employment and we've got a lot of people who are underemployed in parts of this community. We ought to be able to bring our thought power to the question of, what would it take to get them better employed?\par \par \uc2 Your school, Georgia State \u8211\'20\'13 I was talking to somebody at Western Governors', this is a different version of it \u8211\'20\'13 there's a lot of places that are helping people, I think, you know, get into the market. And by the way, all the stats would show that the real difference in lifetime performance is graduation from college. So your parents send you here \u8211\'20\'13 and there's a message. (Laughter.) But those who go to college and don't graduate often don't get the returns that allowed a better job, two or three years spent not earning in the process.\par \par \uc2 And so, again, we're going to try to do as best we can some research that helps put on the map some of these questions and helps policy makers, governors, you know, work against the levers that they can.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: This is a futuristic question about this whole discussion about the future of fractional-reserve banking and whether in the digital era to get rid of banks altogether, have a much narrower system, have this cashless society where all of a sudden it's banks as we know them aren't going to be needed anymore.\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: Yeah. Just an interesting fact that I had no idea about that I've learned in the last three months is, do you know that cash is actually growing and not shrinking? Who knew that? I thought it was going the other way. I guess it's good when you process a lot of cash, but it's actually, you know, moving up.\par \par \uc2 Look, I think every bank in this country needs to pay attention to fintech innovators. I do not \u8211\'20\'13 I went \u8211\'20\'13 I said earlier yesterday I'm a lifetime learner. You'll be glad to know I'm on Venmo. (Laughter.) But two years ago when \u8211\'20\'13 two years ago when my son first tried to get me to pay him on Venmo, I had no idea what it was.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, the banks now are coming out with Zelle, which is a competitor to it. But, you know, I think if you're not in the peer-to-peer payment system as a bank, then you have a real problem and you end up like one of the retailers, you know, I was just talking about.\par \par \uc2 And so I think the good \u8211\'20\'13 now, banks have a natural advantage. Some of you may actually use a safe deposit box. There is still value to getting an ATM. Branches do have value, most people, you know, open their accounts there. But I think it's not enough to have a structural advantage, you've got to be competitive on the innovation. And then if you have A plus B, I think there's a role for you.\par \par \uc2 But if they get out of the zone of being competitive on innovation, then I think there is a real risk that Apple Pay or the card companies or whoever are going to, you know \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 at least on the personal side.\par \par \uc2 The corporate side, when you see guys like Kabbage out there who are doing small-business loans, it is still pretty hard to imagine, you know, underwriting a corporation without knowing the people.\par \par \uc2 MR. CABRERA: So I guess we still teach the Phillips curve. And yet, it turns out since 2000 the correlation between unemployment and inflation is near zero. Even our fearless leader (Fed) Chairman (Jerome) Powell said that the connection is not as close as it once was. So if you get that question in the exam \u8211\'20\'13 final exam this week about Phillips curve, can you say, well, I've heard from Chairman Powell and President Barkin that this is just \u8211\'20\'13 it's a thing of the past?\par \par \uc2 MR. BARKIN: I'd say my thinking is still in flux on this. I am still relatively new. But the Phillips curve is interesting. When I learned it back in the early '80s, I thought of it as the following connection, which is, you know, unemployment at low levels and \u8211\'20\'13 like today \u8211\'20\'13 even extremely low levels ought to lead to wage inflation, right? That's how I thought about it. And that connection still makes perfect sense to me. I mean, you're seeing some connect there, right, even though it's not egregious wage inflation.\par \par \uc2 As I understand, as it evolved over time, it also became a correlation between unemployment and price inflation. And of course, price inflation is wage inflation, and then wages get passed on to customers. I still think that connection works in the long run.\par \par \uc2 In the short run there's something that comes between wages and prices, and that's markets and market power. And it does feel to me like a lot of businesses don't feel they have the market power to pass on the wages and they have other options on how to \u8211\'20\'13 you know, capacity utilization being a great example; it's still running under long-term norms \u8211\'20\'13 try to keep their profit margins without passing on the wages.\par \par \uc2 And so the phrase you hear is it's a relatively flat Phillips curve. But I do still believe personally that an extended period of low unemployment will have that effect. And as a(n) executive, I saw that effect. I said this earlier. When people start leaving your firm, you have no choice but to take action. And that action is compensation. So that is a thing \u8211\'20\'13 that is a real thing that's still existing.\par \par \uc2 I think the flatness is when you start tying it to prices, all the way to prices. Then you end up in a \u8211\'20\'13 I think it's still a longer-run answer. I just think there's lots of short-term things that \u8211\'20\'13 short-run things that happen that diminish the impact.\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-barkin-economy-no-longer-needs-stimulative-interest-rate-stance-1525727294"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Barkin: Economy No Longer Needs Stimulative Interest-Rate Stance }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20180508ee58000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Abbie has enjoyed a brilliant start to her new job as a junior fund manager at\u160\'00\'A0AllianceBernstein, a $500bn investment group in New York. In her first three months she has\u160\'00\'A0handled thousands of bond trades worth nearly $19bn, never complaining,\u160\'00\'A0messing up\u160\'00\'A0or even taking a break.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s because she is an\u160\'00\'A0 algorithm.\par \par \uc2 AllianceBernstein\u8217\'20\'19s latest\u160\'00\'A0robotic employee did initially have a problem understanding some of the niceties of her human bosses \u8212\'20\'14 at first Abbie was stumped by what they meant with the word \u8220\'20\'1Cplease\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 but she already handles about 35 per cent of their\u160\'00\'A0bond trades. The asset manager, which is considering the\u160\'00\'A0 relocation of its headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee, is optimistic that Abbie will soon be able to automate large parts of the work of its two dozen human assistant portfolio managers.\par \par \uc2 Abbie might seem unremarkable to observers who have seen a series of technological revolutions reshape the stock market.\u160\'00\'A0But the bond market has historically been a vast but old-fashioned corner of the financial system, with little transparency and trading often conducted by phone.\par \par \uc2 Yet a confluence of factors is now beginning to have a profound impact on the $50tn fixed income market.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Banks complain that more onerous regulations have hamstrung their ability to play their traditional role in lubricating activity in the bond market. That has\u160\'00\'A0spurred efforts to explore new ways to trade debt. The hope is that modernising the market\u8217\'20\'19s technological architecture can cut costs and improve its efficiency.\par \par \uc2 The\u160\'00\'A0 \u8220\'20\'1Celectronification\u8221\'20\'1D of the bigger government debt markets \u8212\'20\'14 such as US Treasuries or UK Gilts \u8212\'20\'14 is already well under way, and some experts predict that less traded markets such as corporate, municipal or emerging market debt will be the next to succumb to the march of the machines.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 There is still scepticism that bonds can ever trade in a similar fashion to equities. Doubters point out that a company might only have issued one stock, but dozens of unique bonds. In fact, there are only 43,000 stocks in the world, but there are millions of bonds, each with their own legal and financial idiosyncrasies. Bigger chunks of debt are especially hard to trade without human finesse: sceptics compare it to how people might be comfortable buying a TV online, but not a house.\par \par \uc2 But if modern regulations have plunged bond trading into a funk, then modern technology has handed the finance industry the means to turn the predicament into an opportunity. Stocks may be fundamentally different from fixed income,\u160\'00\'A0but that does not mean\u160\'00\'A0the latter cannot benefit from advances in data science and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Moreover, electronification is just one facet of how bond trading is being dragged into the 21st century, with banks and investors exploring myriad ways to modernise the entire fixed income market \u8212\'20\'14 as Abbie attests to.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBefore the crisis the technology available was pretty archaic. But the liquidity available was so good that we didn\u8217\'20\'19t care. Then 2008 happened,\u8221\'20\'1D says Douglas Peebles, AllianceBernstein\u8217\'20\'19s fixed income chief. \u8220\'20\'1CWe want to make the market better, stronger, faster.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 When Richie Prager started on Wall Street in 1981 he had to punch trades into a Telex machine, the keys so cumbersome it felt like they were fighting back. The majority of bond deals were arranged by phone and\u160\'00\'A0 trading floors\u160\'00\'A0 resembled boisterous\u160\'00\'A0street markets. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Today Mr Prager oversees trading at\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest investment group, where quiet data scientists have replaced many\u160\'00\'A0bellowing traders, and workstations look more like a desk at Nasa. \u8220\'20\'1CThe technology [change] is like night and day over the past five years,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Prager says. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s hugely exciting.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  is one of several firms that are pouring money into technology in order to cut costs and improve the efficiency of its bond trading operations \u8212\'20\'14 a trend catalysed by concerns over the health of the bond market. While debt issuance has surged, traders say\u160\'00\'A0 liquidity has deteriorated sharply in recent years, as a torrent of regulations forced banks to reduce their trading desks.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Putting precise numbers around this decline is tricky, as liquidity is an ephemeral concept. Asking a dozen traders will typically yield at least as many answers. But broadly speaking, liquidity is how easy it is to trade a financial asset without significantly moving its price.\u160\'00\'A0Most experts agree that liquidity has atrophied for bonds \u8212\'20\'14 especially at times of stress in the market.\par \par \uc2 That has led to a series of warnings over the years. Blackstone chief \uc2 Stephen Schwarzman\uc2  has argued that the \u8220\'20\'1Cliquidity drought can exacerbate, or even trigger, the next financial crisis\u8221\'20\'1D, while the economist \uc2 Nouriel Roubini\uc2  has predicted that \u8220\'20\'1Cmarket illiquidity will eventually trigger a bust and collapse\u8221\'20\'1D. Even regulators have\u160\'00\'A0 voiced concerns, albeit in more cautious terms.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Thus far the doomsayers might seem like Eeyore, AA Milne\u8217\'20\'19s permanently pessimistic donkey, as\u160\'00\'A0fixed income markets have weathered big tests without any significant dislocations. Yet even if a crisis has failed to materialise, that does not mean\u160\'00\'A0the bond market is in fine fettle. And a number of banks and investment groups think that\u160\'00\'A0part of the solution will lie in the modernisation of fixed income trading.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 This has accelerated the shift towards electronic, equity-style trading on exchanges, as opposed to \u8220\'20\'1Cover the counter\u8221\'20\'1D trading. The \u8220\'20\'1Crates\u8221\'20\'1D market, where the debt of major governments is traded, is already mostly electronic, and corporate debt is also beginning to migrate on to trading platforms \u8212\'20\'14 at least for smaller chunks of debt.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 There are also signs that the traditional divide between the \u8220\'20\'1Cdealer-to-dealer\u8221\'20\'1D bond market, where banks trade with each other, and the \u8220\'20\'1Cdealer-to-client\u8221\'20\'1D area, where they arrange trades for other investors, is beginning to blur, with some experts heralding the dawn of an \u8220\'20\'1Call-to-all\u8221\'20\'1D market for the biggest, most liquid bond markets.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Greenwich Associates\uc2  estimates that a fifth of all investment-grade US corporate bond trades are now done electronically \u8212\'20\'14 almost double the volume of a decade ago. Even riskier \u8220\'20\'1Cjunk bonds\u8221\'20\'1D are beginning to\u160\'00\'A0move that way.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest winners from this shift is\u160\'00\'A0MarketAxess, the largest electronic bond trading forum, which has seen the average monthly volume of bonds traded across its platform\u160\'00\'A0 more than double\u160\'00\'A0 since 2014 to nearly $150bn in 2018. \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a secular trend towards more electronic trading globally,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Rick McVey\uc2 , the company\u8217\'20\'19s chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Banks have also begun to automate smaller bond trades to free up traders for the bigger deals that still require a human touch. For example,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 \u8220\'20\'1Cbond pricing engine\u8221\'20\'1D calculates values for 10,000 bonds every day, allowing its algorithms to handle smaller trades.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 At first the \u8220\'20\'1C Goldman Sachs Algorithm \u8221\'20\'1D only handled trades below $500,000, but today anything below $2m \u8220\'20\'1Cdoesn\u8217\'20\'19t get touched by a human\u8221\'20\'1D, according to Justin Gmelich, a senior executive at the investment bank. \u8220\'20\'1CIn four-five years I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be surprised if we have a lower trader headcount, and have more staff on the algorithmic side,\u8221\'20\'1D he adds.\par \par \uc2 Yet modernising bond market trading\u160\'00\'A0is just one aspect of a much broader, seismic shift. Even sceptics concede\u160\'00\'A0there is a panoply of other areas where modern data science and computing can deliver valuable improvements.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople are focusing a lot on efficiency,\u8221\'20\'1D says Steve Zamsky, chief operating officer for fixed income at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThe conversation has been transformed from talking about electronification of corporate debt trading to increasing the efficiency of the ecosystem across the board.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Take AllianceBernstein\u8217\'20\'19s Abbie. Although primarily an order management algorithm built into the asset manager\u8217\'20\'19s messaging system, its success in automating the humdrum work of sizing and organising trades has fed optimism that it will be able to\u160\'00\'A0perform more significant tasks. By combining Abbie with the bond pricing and trading platform Alfa and research platform Prism, AllianceBernstein hopes the combined trio can become a virtual fund manager.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s only been two years that we\u8217\'20\'19ve embraced the potential of technology, and what we\u8217\'20\'19ve achieved in a short period of time is phenomenal,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jim Switzer, head of credit trading at AllianceBernstein. \u8220\'20\'1CThe bond market is going to look radically different in three years\u8217\'20\'19 time.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Disruption is also coming to bank \u8220\'20\'1Csyndication\u8221\'20\'1D desks, which arrange and sell new debt sales by companies and countries. The author Michael Lewis once described syndication desks as an \u8220\'20\'1Comniscient, omnipotent, omnivorous presence\u8221\'20\'1D on trading floors, but banks are working on new digital platforms to overhaul a process that has long consisted of phone calls, emails, instant messaging services and unwieldy spreadsheets to collect and collate the orders.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Even mobile phones are coming into play.\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  surveyed more than 400 fixed income traders at investment groups last autumn, and 61 per cent said they were \u8220\'20\'1Cextremely\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Csomewhat\u8221\'20\'1D likely to use a mobile trading app in 2018, up from 31 per cent the\u160\'00\'A0year before.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CWe want salespeople and traders focused on selling and trading, rather than spending time on the clunky bits we can automate,\u8221\'20\'1D says Guy America, head of credit trading at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Underscoring the sense of\u160\'00\'A0a tipping point, the \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  last year established an advisory committee on fixed income\u8217\'20\'19s market structure, made up of big money managers, exchanges, borrowers and bankers. This was a vital development, says Amar Kuchinad, head of strategy at\u160\'00\'A0 Trumid, a new bond trading platform and one of the committee\u8217\'20\'19s members.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CRegulatory attention was what really drove innovation in the equity market,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CEvolution is a process. Sometimes it feels so slow that you don\u8217\'20\'19t appreciate how much has changed [in fixed income] already.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But the regulatory interest also highlights concerns over the evolving bond market. Technological disruption can often be painful, and lead to unwanted side-effects. As bond markets become faster and more algorithmic, they will also likely become more prone to the glitches that have plagued\u160\'00\'A0equity markets in recent years.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A vivid example of this came on October 15 2014, when the 10-year\u160\'00\'A0 \uc2 US Treasury\uc2  bond yield suddenly tumbled and then roared higher again, a 37-basis point intraday move so sharp that in theory it should only be expected once every 1.6bn years.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The mayhem was enabled by the advent of faster, algorithmic traders in the \uc2 US Treasury\uc2  market who have stepped into the breach left by retreating banks. Similar \u8220\'20\'1Cflash events\u8221\'20\'1D could become more prevalent across fixed income as automated trading becomes more widespread, the \uc2 Bank for International Settlement\uc2  said in a\u160\'00\'A02016 report.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGiven the importance of fixed income markets for the funding of the real economy and financial stability more broadly, policymakers have a strong interest in assessing how electronification may be affecting market quality,\u8221\'20\'1D the report said.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 However, bankers and investors argue that yearning for the pre-crisis golden years of bond trading is pointless. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople inherently don\u8217\'20\'19t like change, but some of these trends have taken root,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Prager says. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are not going back.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Reshaping the market Bond ETFs boosted by move to electronic trading\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest disruptive forces in the bond market today is the rise of exchange traded funds \u8212\'20\'14 passive index-tracking vehicles that are already reshaping stock markets. Although bond ETFs are behind their equity counterparts in size and development, $144bn has flowed into them over the past year. These allow investors to easily and efficiently trade entire baskets of bonds. This has both been enabled by and is accelerating a shift towards more algorithmic trading in the more liquid corners of the bond market.\par \par \uc2 Many investors and analysts have fretted that the mismatch between the seamless tradability promised by ETFs \u8212\'20\'14 which trade over electronic markets just like stocks \u8212\'20\'14 and the often patchy liquidity of the underlying instruments is a recipe for disaster.\par \par \uc2 However, proponents point out that bond ETFs have weathered several big tests\u160\'00\'A0in recent years and argue that they improve the fixed income market\u8217\'20\'19s resilience. ETFs\u160\'00\'A0make bonds that are included more tradable. They also allow banks to turn a basket of rarely-traded debts into a more liquid instrument through the \u8220\'20\'1Ccreation-redemption\u8221\'20\'1D process, where\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Cauthorised participants\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 often banks \u8212\'20\'14 take the raw material of shares or bonds to make new ETF shares for investors to trade.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe creation/redemption process for bond ETFs could become much more sophisticated, robust and fluid due to enhancements in technology and widespread acceptance of the vehicle,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  argued in a recent paper.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 While there can be dislocations between the price of a bond ETF and its underlying instruments, there are a growing number of trading firms that can arbitrage the difference and thereby narrow it. And in extreme scenarios investors in a bond ETF can receive proportional slivers of the underlying debt.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, given the growth trajectory of bond ETFs, and development of ETFs that invest in increasingly illiquid debt, the concerns of critics are only going to intensify.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180509ee590018r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Investment groups have more than doubled their spending on new digital information sets and data scientists in the past two years, as the asset management industry has tried to reinvigorate its fading fortunes.\par \par \uc2 Asset managers last year spent a total of $373m on data sets and hiring new employees to parse them, up 60 per cent on 2016, and will probably spend a total of $616m this year, according to a survey of investors by AlternativeData.org, a trade body for the industry. It forecasts that overall expenditures will climb to over $1bn by 2020.\par \par \uc2 With its fees under pressure from passive, cheap index-tracking funds, the money management industry is exploring various ways to deploy technology and data to cut costs and improve the efficiency of both back-office functions like fund distribution and compliance as well as on the investment side.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe continue to add investment research staff and are working on a more comprehensive data strategy, including enhancements in the ease of doing business for advisers\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09as well as enhanced data availability for our distribution and investment management teams,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Benjamin Clouse\uc2 , \uc2 Waddell & Reed\uc2  chief financial officer, in the asset manager\u8217\'20\'19s quarterly earnings call.\par \par \uc2 There is no clean definition of alternative data, but it is generally considered to be anything outside of traditional information like economic statistics and corporate reports, such as satellite images, credit card sales, sentiment analysis, mobile geolocation data and website scraping. Typically, the data sets are so large that they need to be parsed with \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques like \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFar from creating a level playing field, where more readily available information simply leads to greater market efficiency, this information revolution is having the opposite effect,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , the UK investment group, noted in a report last month. \u8220\'20\'1CFund managers which invest properly in this area will benefit from an \u8216\'20\'18information edge\u8217\'20\'19.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Alternativedata.org, a body supported by YipitData, one of the swelling number of digital data providers targeting the investment industry, got its estimates from surveying asset managers, but some experts put the numbers much higher. Opimas, a consultancy, estimates that investors are spending about $5bn a year on alternative data, and expect the industry to grow 30 per cent annually in the coming years.\par \par \uc2 The demand for data scientists able to clean up and extract potentially valuable signals from these mammoth digital data sets has deepened over the past year, with people in the industry complaining over an intense battle to find, train and keep people with the technical knowledge to bridge the world of algorithmic data-crunching and finance.\par \par \uc2 Some are turning to acquisitions to build up their ability to harness new digital data sets. \uc2 Franklin Resources\uc2 , often known as \uc2 Franklin Templeton\uc2 , in March bought Random Forest Capital, a debt-focused, data-led investment company for an undisclosed amount, hoping that its technology can support the wider asset manager.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe advanced pace of technological disruption is impacting the traditional investment landscape, providing new ways to identify and originate investment opportunities that generate value for investors,\u8221\'20\'1D said Chris Molumphy, chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton\u8217\'20\'19s fixed income group, in a statement at the time.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180509ee5900107\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

In her first three months she has\u160\'00\'A0handled thousands of bond trades worth nearly $19bn, never complaining,\u160\'00\'A0messing up\u160\'00\'A0or even taking a break.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s because she is an\u160\'00\'A0 algorithm.\par \par \uc2 AllianceBernstein\u8217\'20\'19s latest\u160\'00\'A0robotic employee did initially have a problem understanding some of the niceties of her human bosses \u8212\'20\'14 at first Abbie was stumped by what they meant with the word \u8220\'20\'1Cplease\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 but she already handles about 35 per cent of their\u160\'00\'A0bond trades. The asset manager, which is considering the\u160\'00\'A0 relocation of its headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee, is optimistic that Abbie will soon be able to automate large parts of the work of its two dozen human assistant portfolio managers.\par \par \uc2 Abbie might seem unremarkable to observers who have seen a series of technological revolutions reshape the stock market.\u160\'00\'A0But the bond market has historically been a vast but old-fashioned corner of the financial system, with little transparency and trading often conducted by phone.\par \par \uc2 Yet a confluence of factors is now beginning to have a profound impact on the $50tn fixed income market.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Banks complain that more onerous regulations have hamstrung their ability to play their traditional role in lubricating activity in the bond market. That has\u160\'00\'A0spurred efforts to explore new ways to trade debt. The hope is that modernising the market\u8217\'20\'19s technological architecture can cut costs and improve its efficiency.\par \par \uc2 The\u160\'00\'A0 \u8220\'20\'1Celectronification\u8221\'20\'1D of the bigger government debt markets \u8212\'20\'14 such as US Treasuries or UK Gilts \u8212\'20\'14 is already well under way, and some experts predict that less traded markets such as corporate, municipal or emerging market debt will be the next to succumb to the march of the machines.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 There is still scepticism that bonds can ever trade in a similar fashion to equities. Doubters point out that a company might only have issued one stock, but dozens of unique bonds. In fact, there are only 43,000 stocks in the world, but there are millions of bonds, each with their own legal and financial idiosyncrasies. Bigger chunks of debt are especially hard to trade without human finesse: sceptics compare it to how people might be comfortable buying a TV online, but not a house.\par \par \uc2 But if modern regulations have plunged bond trading into a funk, then modern technology has handed the finance industry the means to turn the predicament into an opportunity. Stocks may be fundamentally different from fixed income,\u160\'00\'A0but that does not mean\u160\'00\'A0the latter cannot benefit from advances in data science and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Moreover, electronification is just one facet of how bond trading is being dragged into the 21st century, with banks and investors exploring myriad ways to modernise the entire fixed income market \u8212\'20\'14 as Abbie attests to.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBefore the crisis the technology available was pretty archaic. But the liquidity available was so good that we didn\u8217\'20\'19t care. Then 2008 happened,\u8221\'20\'1D says Douglas Peebles, AllianceBernstein\u8217\'20\'19s fixed income chief. \u8220\'20\'1CWe want to make the market better, stronger, faster.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 When Richie Prager started on Wall Street in 1981 he had to punch trades into a Telex machine, the keys so cumbersome it felt like they were fighting back. The majority of bond deals were arranged by phone and\u160\'00\'A0 trading floors\u160\'00\'A0 resembled boisterous\u160\'00\'A0street markets. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Today Mr Prager oversees trading at\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest investment group, where quiet data scientists have replaced many\u160\'00\'A0bellowing traders, and workstations look more like a desk at Nasa. \u8220\'20\'1CThe technology [change] is like night and day over the past five years,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Prager says. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s hugely exciting.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  is one of several firms that are pouring money into technology in order to cut costs and improve the efficiency of its bond trading operations \u8212\'20\'14 a trend catalysed by concerns over the health of the bond market. While debt issuance has surged, traders say\u160\'00\'A0 liquidity has deteriorated sharply in recent years, as a torrent of regulations forced banks to reduce their trading desks.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Putting precise numbers around this decline is tricky, as liquidity is an ephemeral concept. Asking a dozen traders will typically yield at least as many answers. But broadly speaking, liquidity is how easy it is to trade a financial asset without significantly moving its price.\u160\'00\'A0Most experts agree that liquidity has atrophied for bonds \u8212\'20\'14 especially at times of stress in the market.\par \par \uc2 That has led to a series of warnings over the years. Blackstone chief \uc2 Stephen Schwarzman\uc2  has argued that the \u8220\'20\'1Cliquidity drought can exacerbate, or even trigger, the next financial crisis\u8221\'20\'1D, while the economist \uc2 Nouriel Roubini\uc2  has predicted that \u8220\'20\'1Cmarket illiquidity will eventually trigger a bust and collapse\u8221\'20\'1D. Even regulators have\u160\'00\'A0 voiced concerns, albeit in more cautious terms.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Thus far the doomsayers might seem like Eeyore, AA Milne\u8217\'20\'19s permanently pessimistic donkey, as\u160\'00\'A0fixed income markets have weathered big tests without any significant dislocations. Yet even if a crisis has failed to materialise, that does not mean\u160\'00\'A0the bond market is in fine fettle. And a number of banks and investment groups think that\u160\'00\'A0part of the solution will lie in the modernisation of fixed income trading.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 This has accelerated the shift towards electronic, equity-style trading on exchanges, as opposed to \u8220\'20\'1Cover the counter\u8221\'20\'1D trading. The \u8220\'20\'1Crates\u8221\'20\'1D market, where the debt of major governments is traded, is already mostly electronic, and corporate debt is also beginning to migrate on to trading platforms \u8212\'20\'14 at least for smaller chunks of debt.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 There are also signs that the traditional divide between the \u8220\'20\'1Cdealer-to-dealer\u8221\'20\'1D bond market, where banks trade with each other, and the \u8220\'20\'1Cdealer-to-client\u8221\'20\'1D area, where they arrange trades for other investors, is beginning to blur, with some experts heralding the dawn of an \u8220\'20\'1Call-to-all\u8221\'20\'1D market for the biggest, most liquid bond markets.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Greenwich Associates\uc2  estimates that a fifth of all investment-grade US corporate bond trades are now done electronically \u8212\'20\'14 almost double the volume of a decade ago. Even riskier \u8220\'20\'1Cjunk bonds\u8221\'20\'1D are beginning to\u160\'00\'A0move that way.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest winners from this shift is\u160\'00\'A0MarketAxess, the largest electronic bond trading forum, which has seen the average monthly volume of bonds traded across its platform\u160\'00\'A0 more than double\u160\'00\'A0 since 2014 to nearly $150bn in 2018. \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a secular trend towards more electronic trading globally,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Rick McVey\uc2 , the company\u8217\'20\'19s chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Banks have also begun to automate smaller bond trades to free up traders for the bigger deals that still require a human touch. For example,\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 \u8220\'20\'1Cbond pricing engine\u8221\'20\'1D calculates values for 10,000 bonds every day, allowing its algorithms to handle smaller trades.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 At first the \u8220\'20\'1C Goldman Sachs Algorithm \u8221\'20\'1D only handled trades below $500,000, but today anything below $2m \u8220\'20\'1Cdoesn\u8217\'20\'19t get touched by a human\u8221\'20\'1D, according to Justin Gmelich, a senior executive at the investment bank. \u8220\'20\'1CIn four-five years I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be surprised if we have a lower trader headcount, and have more staff on the algorithmic side,\u8221\'20\'1D he adds.\par \par \uc2 Yet modernising bond market trading\u160\'00\'A0is just one aspect of a much broader, seismic shift. Even sceptics concede\u160\'00\'A0there is a panoply of other areas where modern data science and computing can deliver valuable improvements.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople are focusing a lot on efficiency,\u8221\'20\'1D says Steve Zamsky, chief operating officer for fixed income at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThe conversation has been transformed from talking about electronification of corporate debt trading to increasing the efficiency of the ecosystem across the board.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Take AllianceBernstein\u8217\'20\'19s Abbie. Although primarily an order management algorithm built into the asset manager\u8217\'20\'19s messaging system, its success in automating the humdrum work of sizing and organising trades has fed optimism that it will be able to\u160\'00\'A0perform more significant tasks. By combining Abbie with the bond pricing and trading platform Alfa and research platform Prism, AllianceBernstein hopes the combined trio can become a virtual fund manager.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s only been two years that we\u8217\'20\'19ve embraced the potential of technology, and what we\u8217\'20\'19ve achieved in a short period of time is phenomenal,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jim Switzer, head of credit trading at AllianceBernstein. \u8220\'20\'1CThe bond market is going to look radically different in three years\u8217\'20\'19 time.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Disruption is also coming to bank \u8220\'20\'1Csyndication\u8221\'20\'1D desks, which arrange and sell new debt sales by companies and countries. The author Michael Lewis once described syndication desks as an \u8220\'20\'1Comniscient, omnipotent, omnivorous presence\u8221\'20\'1D on trading floors, but banks are working on new digital platforms to overhaul a process that has long consisted of phone calls, emails, instant messaging services and unwieldy spreadsheets to collect and collate the orders.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Even mobile phones are coming into play.\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  surveyed more than 400 fixed income traders at investment groups last autumn, and 61 per cent said they were \u8220\'20\'1Cextremely\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Csomewhat\u8221\'20\'1D likely to use a mobile trading app in 2018, up from 31 per cent the\u160\'00\'A0year before.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CWe want salespeople and traders focused on selling and trading, rather than spending time on the clunky bits we can automate,\u8221\'20\'1D says Guy America, head of credit trading at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Underscoring the sense of\u160\'00\'A0a tipping point, the \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  last year established an advisory committee on fixed income\u8217\'20\'19s market structure, made up of big money managers, exchanges, borrowers and bankers. This was a vital development, says Amar Kuchinad, head of strategy at\u160\'00\'A0 Trumid, a new bond trading platform and one of the committee\u8217\'20\'19s members.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CRegulatory attention was what really drove innovation in the equity market,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CEvolution is a process. Sometimes it feels so slow that you don\u8217\'20\'19t appreciate how much has changed [in fixed income] already.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But the regulatory interest also highlights concerns over the evolving bond market. Technological disruption can often be painful, and lead to unwanted side-effects. As bond markets become faster and more algorithmic, they will also likely become more prone to the glitches that have plagued\u160\'00\'A0equity markets in recent years.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A vivid example of this came on October 15 2014, when the 10-year\u160\'00\'A0 \uc2 US Treasury\uc2  bond yield suddenly tumbled and then roared higher again, a 37-basis point intraday move so sharp that in theory it should only be expected once every 1.6bn years.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The mayhem was enabled by the advent of faster, algorithmic traders in the \uc2 US Treasury\uc2  market who have stepped into the breach left by retreating banks. Similar \u8220\'20\'1Cflash events\u8221\'20\'1D could become more prevalent across fixed income as automated trading becomes more widespread, the \uc2 Bank for International Settlement\uc2  said in a\u160\'00\'A02016 report.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGiven the importance of fixed income markets for the funding of the real economy and financial stability more broadly, policymakers have a strong interest in assessing how electronification may be affecting market quality,\u8221\'20\'1D the report said.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 However, bankers and investors argue that yearning for the pre-crisis golden years of bond trading is pointless. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople inherently don\u8217\'20\'19t like change, but some of these trends have taken root,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Prager says. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are not going back.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Reshaping the market Bond ETFs boosted by move to electronic trading\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest disruptive forces in the bond market today is the rise of exchange traded funds \u8212\'20\'14 passive index-tracking vehicles that are already reshaping stock markets. Although bond ETFs are behind their equity counterparts in size and development, $144bn has flowed into them over the past year. These allow investors to easily and efficiently trade entire baskets of bonds. This has both been enabled by and is accelerating a shift towards more algorithmic trading in the more liquid corners of the bond market.\par \par \uc2 Many investors and analysts have fretted that the mismatch between the seamless tradability promised by ETFs \u8212\'20\'14 which trade over electronic markets just like stocks \u8212\'20\'14 and the often patchy liquidity of the underlying instruments is a recipe for disaster.\par \par \uc2 However, proponents point out that bond ETFs have weathered several big tests\u160\'00\'A0in recent years and argue that they improve the fixed income market\u8217\'20\'19s resilience. ETFs\u160\'00\'A0make bonds that are included more tradable. They also allow banks to turn a basket of rarely-traded debts into a more liquid instrument through the \u8220\'20\'1Ccreation-redemption\u8221\'20\'1D process, where\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Cauthorised participants\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 often banks \u8212\'20\'14 take the raw material of shares or bonds to make new ETF shares for investors to trade.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe creation/redemption process for bond ETFs could become much more sophisticated, robust and fluid due to enhancements in technology and widespread acceptance of the vehicle,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  argued in a recent paper.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 While there can be dislocations between the price of a bond ETF and its underlying instruments, there are a growing number of trading firms that can arbitrage the difference and thereby narrow it. And in extreme scenarios investors in a bond ETF can receive proportional slivers of the underlying debt.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, given the growth trajectory of bond ETFs, and development of ETFs that invest in increasingly illiquid debt, the concerns of critics are only going to intensify.\par \par \uc2 Letter in response to this article:\par \par \uc2 Time for technology to shake up bond trading / From Simon Fasdal, London, UK\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020180509ee590018q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

At Friday\u8217\'20\'19s market close, the company had a market capitalisation of $5.1bn and its shares were trading at $126.08.\par \par \uc2 The company said it had received the offer and that the board would review it.\par \par \uc2 Elliott has had \u8220\'20\'1Cextensive private engagement\u8221\'20\'1D with the group\u8217\'20\'19s management and board, but the \u8220\'20\'1Cstark reality\u8221\'20\'1D is that as a public company, \uc2 Athenahealth\uc2  \u8220\'20\'1Chas not worked for many years, is not working today and will not work in the future\u8221\'20\'1D, Elliott partner and senior portfolio manager \uc2 Jesse Cohn\uc2  said in a letter to the company\u8217\'20\'19s board on Monday.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor many years, despite all of its advantages, \uc2 Athenahealth\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s stock price has underperformed because the company has failed to correct a host of identifiable operational issues,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 Athenahealth\uc2  was one of the biggest beneficiaries of Obama-era rules that required doctors to use electronic medical records rather than paper files. However, many of the systems used to meet those requirements are seen as clunky and imperfect, and vulnerable to disruption from better technologies that use \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to help guide physicians.\par \par \uc2 The fund said the company has been hurt by turnover in its leadership ranks, a lack of ability to execute its plans, operating inefficiencies in several of its products and a record of missing its targets.\par \par \uc2 Elliott first took a stake in the company in May last year. Since then the Massachusetts-based group has replaced its chief financial officer, its chief executive ceded his chairmanship, and it announced plans to reduce its workforce by 9 per cent.\par \par \uc2 In February, former General Electric chief executive \uc2 Jeff Immelt\uc2  was named chairman of Athenahealth\u8217\'20\'19s board of directors, a move that was not supported by Elliott, according to people familiar with the appointment.\par \par \uc2 The fund has been working on a deal for several months and has co-investors, but the deal is being led by Elliott.\par \par \uc2 The company was once a popular short for hedge funds, including \uc2 David Einhorn\uc2 . In 2014, Mr Einhorn, who runs \uc2 Greenlight Capital\uc2 , called Athena a \u8220\'20\'1Cbubble stock because its shares had gone parabolic even as its fundamentals deteriorated\u8221\'20\'1D in a presentation at a conference.\par \par \uc2 The $35bn hedge fund has been increasingly expanding its strategy of late to include private equity-style takeovers. In the UK it hired Paul Best last year from Warburg Pincus to lead its private equity business. Less than two weeks ago the fund bought a controlling stake in Waterstones, the British high street bookstore.\par \par \uc2 In the US Mr Cohn oversees the fund\u8217\'20\'19s technology acquisitions, including a $1.6bn deal for the network software firm \uc2 Gigamon\uc2  in October.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180507ee570048u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Specifically Jersey cows, which are famed for their docility, petite size and prodigious output. Mr Harris spent four years in the Channel Islands in the 1980s and 1990s, when he ran Citi\u8217\'20\'19s European investment trust and treasury business. He became a connoisseur of bovines.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI can tell you all about Jersey cows,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThey are some of the best milking cows in the world and they have a beautiful brown coat.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The tranquillity of Jersey is a distant memory. Today, Mr Harris works in Manhattan, which is sadly cow-free, and he heads \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s sprawling $1.9tn asset management arm.\par \par \uc2 BNY Investment Management might not enjoy the recognition given to some of its peers in the $1tn club \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , \uc2 Fidelity\uc2  or Capital Group \u8212\'20\'14 but it owns boldfaced names including Insight Investment and Newton in London, Standish and Mellon Capital Management in the US, and credit specialist Alcentra.\par \par \uc2 Sitting in a meeting room enlivened only by an 1869 painting by David Johnson \u8212\'20\'14 one of the Hudson River school, which created seminal representations of nature in upstate New York \u8212\'20\'14 Mr Harris lays out how he was reshaping BNYIM.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe want to focus on where the market is going rather than being trapped in the past,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 CV Mitchell Harris\par \par \uc2 Born\par \par \uc2 January 31 1955\par \par \uc2 Total pay\par \par \uc2 $9.4m, includes BNY Mellon stock awards\par \par \uc2 Education\par \par \uc2 State University of New York at Albany\uc2 : BA in political science and history; masters in public administration\par \par \uc2 Career\par \par \uc2 1979-93\par \par \uc2 Citibank\uc2 .

Mr Harris moved up the company and won the top job in 2016. His experience makes him appreciate BNYIM\u8217\'20\'19s multi-boutique model \u8212\'20\'14 and also what is needed to reshape the organisation to respond to fierce competition.\par \par \uc2 The biggest step came late last year, when BNYIM said it would smash together three of its US investment arms. Although the industry is nowadays abuzz with rumour of mergers and acquisitions, the combination of Mellon Capital, Standish and the Boston Company is a rare example of internal consolidation\par \par \uc2 The merger reduced the number of asset management entities within BNYIM to 10, from 27 a decade previously. With more than $577bn in assets, the combined business would rank as one of the 10 biggest institutional asset managers in the US and one of the top 50 globally.\par \par \uc2 The move underscores how executives predict the industry will split between smaller, specialist, boutique fund managers, and giants that have the heft to offer investors a one-stop shop and fund the investment in compliance, distribution and technology needed to thrive.\par \par \uc2 While the investment teams will remain untouched, the three asset managers \u8220\'20\'1Cweren\u8217\'20\'19t of sufficient scale\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09that it made sense to have three CEOs, three CTOs, three compliance teams and legal departments\u8221\'20\'1D, says Mr Harris. This will free up resources to reinvest.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CStrategically, they were in the traditional equity and fixed income spaces where people are pouring out of, from active to passive,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CDo you revise three businesses or do you consolidate and repivot one business by developing products more attuned to where the business is going?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 By the end of this year the \u8220\'20\'1Cnewco\u8221\'20\'1D will have a name. \u8220\'20\'1CYou don\u8217\'20\'19t rebrand Coke until you\u8217\'20\'19ve changed the formula,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Harris quips.\par \par \uc2 The internal merger is the most obvious part of a broader effort to retool BNYIM. It has shuttered, consolidated or reshaped 84 products in two years, while launching 80 lines designed to fit evolving demand. Institutional investors may be shifting into passive products but evaporating bond yields and a dimmer outlook for long-term returns have also spurred them into riskier strategies.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEveryone talks about the active-to-passive shift, and it\u8217\'20\'19s real, but the part they don\u8217\'20\'19t talk about is that it\u8217\'20\'19s a barbell,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Harris. \u8220\'20\'1CThey\u8217\'20\'19re moving to emerging markets, to multi-asset products, to distressed debt \u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09there are still some good fees to be made in differentiated products.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Technology and data are also in focus. Mr Harris is enthusiastic about how \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  can trim costs and improve processes. Predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  may also bring more rigour to the fund sales and distribution process. \u8220\'20\'1CSales used to be about golf balls and beer drinking, now there is a science to sales,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 The chief executive is also excited about the potential of the parent company\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cmother lode\u8221\'20\'1D of data. As well as its $1.9tn of assets under management, BNY Mellon is custodian or administrator of a further $33.3tn, giving it a unique, instantaneous insight into the flow of money in the global financial system.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will allow its asset management subsidiary to harness that. \u8220\'20\'1CTo see the world\u8217\'20\'19s movements on a daily basis can tell you an awful lot,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Harris.\par \par \uc2 BNY Mellon Investment Management\par \par \uc2 Founded\par \par \uc2 1983\par \par \uc2 Assets\par \par \uc2 $1.9tn\par \par \uc2 Headquarters\par \par \uc2 New York City\par \par \uc2 Ownership\par \par \uc2 BNY Mellon\par \par \uc2 He cautions, however, that some of the hype over \u8220\'20\'1C\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D and AI was overdone.\par \par \uc2 He fetches from his office an Economist article from 1995 that details how \uc2 Pareto Partners\uc2  was even then managing an AI-aided $100m bond strategy. So AI is not new and does not always work, Mr Harris says.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CModels are good until they\u8217\'20\'19re not. They can\u8217\'20\'19t handle things that are outside the norms,\u8221\'20\'1D he points out. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is like when the internet [was] launched. We knew it was powerful but we had no clue how far it would go. I think people\u8217\'20\'19s excitement far exceeds our ability to harness it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 One area that Mr Harris feels the industry is not overhyping is cyber security. He personally has been the victim of a data breach, an episode that brought home its importance.\par \par \uc2 Institutions such as BNYIM have an edge over smaller rivals in the race to stay a step ahead of hackers, he says, but he still frets over the potential for disaster.\par \par \uc2 Mr Harris compares the cyber security threat to how Earth is constantly pummelled by meteors, with most being vaporised by the atmosphere. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s kind of frightening when you think\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09about which one is going to penetrate,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 It is a different challenge from his days in Jersey, with its low crime rate. \u8220\'20\'1CYou didn\u8217\'20\'19t even need to lock your door,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Harris recalls wistfully.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180507ee57000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

By Jonathan Moules\par \par \uc2 Guillaume Piard went to business school to get away from banking. The then vice-president in the structured solutions division of Nomura, the Japanese bank, had spent a decade working at institutions in London and Paris, but felt frustrated by the rising tide of regulation in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 After studying at \uc2 Chicago's Booth School of Business\uc2 , Mr Piard has returned to the finance industry as the founder of a fintech start-up.\par \par \uc2 "I hadn't appreciated the range of options to work in this industry," he says, adding that he is glad to have found an alternative to a salaried role in a large investment bank. "Before business school it would never have occurred to me to go down this path."\par \par \uc2 The banking sector is holding its own as an MBA employer. But it is doing so in part by offering new kinds of jobs, either as part of in-house teams developing new digital strategies or for those who want to work for fintech companies.\par \par \uc2 The catalyst has been competition from the technology sector. Big tech companies, particularly \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , have entered the recruitment market for the best MBA talent in recent years, so the finance sector has had to fight back. \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , together with \uc2 Google\uc2  and Apple, is among the biggest recruiters from top-tier business schools.\par \par \uc2 However, the banking industry remains a key employer, according to the latest Financial Times specialist ranking of the 50 best places to study for those seeking a career in finance. On average, 30 per cent of graduates from each of these schools went into finance.\par \par \uc2 The list is a spin-off from the FT Global MBA ranking, which was published in January. It is based on the number of alumni who reported finding work in finance, banking or fintech start-ups three years after graduation.\par \par \uc2 The most successful schools have retained their value to the banks, venture capitalists and asset management firms by teaching skills for a changing world of disruptive business models and digital finance. They also tend to be institutions that nurture students who wish to launch their own ventures.\par \par \uc2 The list is dominated by US schools, which account for 27 out of the 50 ranked schools. British and Chinese schools form the next largest group with six members.\par \par \uc2 New York University's Stern School of Business, which benefits from proximity to Wall Street, is at number five in the ranking. About a third of the most recent graduating class of 345 MBA students entered the finance sector, a proportion that has remained unchanged for years, according to Beth Briggs, assistant dean in Stern's careers service.\par \par \uc2 Amazon\uc2  was the school's biggest recruiter for the first time this year. But the financial services sector provided more jobs than the tech sector, which hired barely 10 per cent of the class.\par \par \uc2 "For us, banking is still a place where the cool kids want to go," Ms Briggs says.\par \par \uc2 A thorough understanding of the digital world is essential for those going into finance, she adds. Banks are interested in building new strategies based around \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and other technological breakthroughs. "The skills they want are digital, such as data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and AI," she says.\par \par \uc2 One of the reasons the banking sector continues to accept a large proportion of Stern graduates is that the school can provide connections with alumni working in the sector. "We have very deep relationships," Ms Briggs says.\par \par \uc2 Such connections are important in banking, where those hiring are often split between those that have studied at business schools, and those who have not, according to \uc2 St\u233\'00\'E9phane Rambosson\uc2 , chief executive of Vici, an executive search company.\par \par \uc2 "It really depends on the DNA of the team and whether there are MBAs or not in the leadership, whether people get hired," Mr Rambosson says, adding that some executives make a point of not hiring graduates from business schools because of "bad experiences" with MBAs in the past.\par \par \uc2 In the US, some of the biggest opportunities for those hoping to work in banking are close to the tech sector in California. It means even MBA graduates who do not take jobs in big tech may end up working for these giants indirectly, for example by serving the tech sector in a large investment bank.\par \par \uc2 This trend is most acute at the institution at the top of this year's FT top 50 MBAs for finance, \uc2 Stanford Graduate School of Business\uc2 , whose campus lies in the heart of Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 The proportion of its MBA graduates who found work in finance increased to 38 per cent in this year's ranking data, up from 27 per cent in 2017. At the same time the proportion of Stanford MBA graduates going into entrepreneurship in the three years after graduation fell from 36 per cent to 22 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Both the growth in finance jobs and the decline in graduate start-ups reflect a revival in the US jobs market, according to Deborah Whitman, director of Stanford's Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. "The incredibly strong jobs market is making the opportunity cost of entrepreneurship high enough that it is causing a few alumni to put their entrepreneurial dreams on hold for now," she says.\par \par \uc2 Chicago Booth\uc2 , a school with a strong reputation for finance, is third in the FT's ranking. Last year 46 per cent of its class went into finance roles, up from 41 per cent in 2014. Before last year, the proportion going into investment banking had been flat at about 15 per cent of the total MBA cohort, but a growing percentage are entering jobs in San Francisco, according to Julie Morton, Booth's associate dean of career services.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the proportion of Booth students finding jobs in the tech sector immediately after graduation has increased from 14 per cent in 2014 to 19 per cent last year. These graduates have different reasons for wanting to work for the fastest-growing digital businesses, according to Ms Morton. "They still want to be investment bankers," she says.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund has a 10-year annualized total return of 9.4%. A chart with an Investing in Funds article Monday about ETFs with an "ESG focus" -- environmental, social and governance issues -- misstated the return as 14.64%. Also, while the chart accurately showed that all eight ESG funds with a 10-year record are trailing that S&P benchmark, the funds' individual return figures were overstated in a similar fashion. A corrected chart is at WSJ.com/Corrections.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ May 10, 2018)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 ESG exchange-traded funds are having their day.\par \par \uc2 Over the past 10 years, ETFs with a focus on environmental, social and governance issues have fallen short of broad stock-market returns. But in the 12 months through March of this year, most ESG exchange-traded funds outperformed the broad market.\par \par \uc2 That is a promising omen for ESG funds, also known as sustainable, impact, or socially responsible funds. But it's too soon to tell if the positive performance is sustainable. "Long-term studies show these funds have a chance to outperform, but you can't draw any conclusions from one year," says Hortense Bioy, director of passive-fund research in Europe for investment researcher Morningstar.\par \par \uc2 A study from research firm ETF.com shows that 26 of the 47 socially responsible ETFs that have been around for more than a year, or 55%, outperformed the broad market as represented by \uc2 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\uc2  (SPY) for the 12 months through March 31.\par \par \uc2 That is quite a contrast to the 10 years ended that date. The eight funds that have existed for that period all trailed SPY's 10-year performance, with only two coming close.\par \par \uc2 ESG exchange-traded funds also have drawn a growing amount of money from investors in the past couple of years. Net inflows totaled $1.43 billion for the 12 months ended March 31 of this year, up from $1.01 billion the previous year, making it the biggest inflow for any year ending on March 31 since 2008, according to \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So what changed over the past year? "You can never reach into the mind of investors, but I'd like to say they are putting their money where their mouth is," says Dave Nadig, managing director of ETF.com, a unit of \uc2 Cboe Global Markets Inc\uc2 . "We have heard that institutional investors are interested in ESG for a long time. Now we're starting to hear from advisers that the same is true for individual investors," particularly millennials and wealthy women.\par \par \uc2 Structural changes in the funds also have helped draw investors and boost performance, analysts say.\par \par \uc2 In the past, managers of ESG funds largely built their portfolios by simply eliminating stocks with negative ESG ratings, but recently their focus has turned more to choosing the companies that have the best financial performance among those with positive ESG ratings, reflecting a change in emphasis among investors.\par \par \uc2 "There has been an evolution," Mrs. Bioy says. "Now investors prefer products with companies that are best in class in a certain category," such as limiting carbon emissions.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, investors shouldn't necessarily expect their 401(k) plans to be full of ESG options. The Labor Department, which oversees 401(k) plans, issued a notice in April saying companies "must not too readily treat ESG factors as economically relevant" to investing choices. "It does not ineluctably follow from the fact that an investment promotes ESG factors, or that it arguably promotes positive general market trends or industry growth, that the investment is a prudent choice for retirement or other investors," the department wrote in its guidance.\par \par \uc2 The top-returning ESG exchange-traded product over the past year was the exchange-traded note \uc2 iPath Global Carbon ETN\uc2  (GRN), with a return of 197%. That points to another factor boosting the category: improved statistics. "Ten years ago, finding out the carbon impact of a small-cap, emerging-markets company was impossible," Mr. Nadig says. Now, data sets are more available, he says, widening the pool of stocks available to portfolio managers. In addition, fund issuers can do more-detailed research on companies' financial performance, thanks to advances in \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , so it's easier for them to find the most promising stocks in that wider pool.\par \par \uc2 Another bullish factor for ESG funds over the past year is that newer entrants into the category have adopted a tighter focus. The top returners after GRN during the past year were WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises ETF (CXSE), with a return of 52%; \uc2 Guggenheim Solar ETF\uc2  (TAN), 42%; WisdomTree Emerging Markets ex-State-Owned Enterprises ETF (XSOE), 27%; and \uc2 Barclays Return on Disability ETN\uc2  (RODI), 26%.\par \par \uc2 "The narrow focus makes it easier to find outliers," Mr. Nadig says. "China ex-State-Owned Enterprises is a smaller set of securities, and the opportunity for outperformance goes up."\par \par \uc2 Analysts warn, though, that those tight targets are a double-edged sword. "The narrower focus works in certain environments and hurts in others," says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at research firm CFRA. Chinese stocks and technology stocks generated stellar returns last year, while fossil-fuel stocks sagged. But that almost certainly won't be the case every year. "The law of small numbers is that some will hit it out of the park, and some will strike out," Mr. Rosenbluth says.\par \par \uc2 Another thing to keep in mind in considering the performance of ESG exchange-traded funds is that it's difficult to tell how much the performance of the stocks they hold stems from ESG factors. Indeed, "what drives individual stocks often has nothing to do with ESG," Mr. Rosenbluth says. For example, the top holding of \uc2 iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF\uc2  (SUSA), which returned 13% in the past year, is \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . "I'm not sure exactly why \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  did well last year, but it has less to do with ESG than broader demand for its products," he says.\par \par \uc2 One approach for investors interested in ESG would be to treat funds that closely track broad market indexes as core holdings and funds that are narrower as satellite holdings, says \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 's Mrs. Bioy. For example, \uc2 SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF\uc2  (SPYX) could substitute for the SPY S&P 500 fund as a core position. And the tightly focused funds cited above could be satellite positions.\par \par \uc2 Given that ETFs represent passive investments, what investors should hope for is returns in line with broad market indexes plus a psychic benefit, Mr. Rosenbluth says.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weil is a writer in West Palm Beach, Fla.

And you've mentioned price-level targeting and some of the things that Ben has talked about.\par \par \uc2 But the question I have is this, that if I think about the mainstream monetary policy frameworks over the last half-century, the Fed was never the innovator. And in a sense, that was good for the world because you matter so much. Is there an example of price-level targeting or nominal (gross domestic product) targeting that you're looking at and saying, you know, that has really kind of worked in a medium-sized country and we think we could adapt it to the U.S.?\par \par \uc2 The second thing is a number of you \u8211\'20\'13 I think all of you, actually; I certainly completely agree with this \u8211\'20\'13 said some combination of it's very important that we mustn't go beyond the boundaries of our powers, and also that it's kind of vitally important to maintain a resilient financial system. And yet, throughout the whole day almost nothing has been said about resolution policy. And if I may say so, this is absolutely typical of the Fed because resolution policy belongs to the (\uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 .), and it's always about what you can do.\par \par \uc2 And the \u8211\'20\'13 I want to suggest to you and ask you to respond \u8210\'20\'12 these two things are linked. The perception that you went beyond your powers, fairly or unfairly, is to do with the lender of last resort operation. If the resolution powers at the FDIC and others are now not as workable as people like I think they can be, that relieves the pressure on you to go beyond into the unknown with lender of last resort. Are you prepared to talk more about resolution policy in the future and to make it work?\par \par \uc2 ROBERT S. KAPLAN: So I'll take \u8211\'20\'13 I'll take a stab at both, and I guess I'll comment on both.\par \par \uc2 Let me just talk \u8211\'20\'13 the point \u8211\'20\'13 this is \u8211\'20\'13 this is all my own \u8211\'20\'13 the point is not whether we ultimately adopt, for me, nominal GDP targeting or price-level targeting. The point, for me, is that we show on a regular basis there have been governance recommendations about the Fed. We've talked about the balance sheet today. We've talked about our frameworks. We've talked about our inflation \u8211\'20\'13 you know, all those things. I just think that we do talk about all these things regularly.\par \par \uc2 I just think \u8211\'20\'13 I come from the business world. I think having a strategic review every X period of time is a healthy thing. So, rather than getting into any of the pros and cons of any one element that we're going to debate \u8211\'20\'13 and I think we should take views from outside, we should look at what's been done in other countries. I don't think we should make changes unless we have conviction. The point on this, for me, is about process than about debating the pros or cons of any one thing.\par \par \uc2 Second, on your comment \u8211\'20\'13 I'll speak as a businessman on this issue of resolution authority; someone, again, who worked in the industry \u8211\'20\'13 and I hate to use this analogy, but I'll use it. The analogy is you smoke, you drink, you're way overweight \u8211\'20\'13 no offense to anybody here \u8211\'20\'13 and then you have a serious \u8211\'20\'13 and everybody's said for years, God, I can't believe he's \u8211\'20\'13 he or she is still upright after all this. And then you have a terrible event happen, and then all the discussions about what we did in the emergency room, you know, he suffered some damage, but. So I'm much more of a fan and my experience is seared into my head that, yes, we spend a lot of time talking about resolution authority and living wills and all of these other elements.\par \par \uc2 But I think \u8211\'20\'13 we only have a one-day conference here and so much time \u8211\'20\'13 but I think what we do, if you \u8211\'20\'13\u8210\'20\'12 if that's your ultimate defense, we're going to be in a lot of trouble. I think we are \u8211\'20\'13 we are much better served talking about sound monetary policy and how we use our balance sheet and all these other issues, because by the time you get to resolution authority, no, I don't think it takes the place or takes any pressure off us to figure out how to deal with the balance sheet and how we might use it.\par \par \uc2 ESTHER L. GEORGE: I'm not sure we need to change the framework, to be honest. I think what we need to do is be open to many of the calls that we hear about what's wrong that you can't get 2 percent (inflation) and what do you mean by symmetric. So I think, as it was framed earlier, being open to thinking about that I think is healthy for the institution. It helps make us more accountable for what we do.\par \par \uc2 On the resolution policy, I would just say I'm probably the skeptic here because I see no evidence that we \u8211\'20\'13 we certainly have not \u8211\'20\'13 yet to prove that these resolution regimes will work in practice as well as they do in theory, and it's why I tend to lean more heavily on the idea of things we do know. We do know strong leverage ratios, we do know strong capital liquidity are going to be key, I think, based on experience and the research that has been done. And I still get a very strong sense that the market believes banks are too big to fail. So when I look at the size \u8211\'20\'13 this is just in the U.S. \u8211\'20\'13 an $11 trillion industry, we should keep working on resolution for sure. But I'm not sure that we're there yet.\par \par \uc2 RAPHAEL W. BOSTIC: So I totally agree with that. I would just say I think that prevention is a big focus for me. I think about this from a basic health perspective. If you wait until you get to a crisis situation, the disruption and the pain is a lot worse and it costs a lot more money. So if we can avoid that, I think that's in our interest.\par \par \uc2 And we should \u8211\'20\'13 I think we should try to make sure that when you get to the crisis that the transition happens smoothly and as many assets are preserved and as much value is preserved as possible. But I don't think it substitutes for making sure that we minimize that we actually get there.\par \par \uc2 And I just think \u8211\'20\'13 one of my takeaways that I hope you have\u8230\'20\'26that I've had as a realization, is that you guys should know we are pretty thoughtful. (Laughter.) And I say this because I've heard \u8211\'20\'13 I've gotten an implication, in a sense, that you guys think \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 things, that there is a preordained policy that we all come to and I have to pledge fealty to before I'm going to get my position. And that's not the case.\par \par \uc2 I think that we all come in \u8211\'20\'13 and one of the nice things with my colleagues is that, you know, we are \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 and we're open to discussions. And conferences like this are actually quite helpful for us in terms of getting a better sense of what things we need to think harder about or know more about, because we're \u8211\'20\'13 we are in unchartered territory and the transition path is not one that people have experienced before. So it's just going to require thought, and we're all very open to doing that.\par \par \uc2 MR. PLOSSER: OK. I'm going to use the chair's prerogative here to intervene and make just a comment, because Paul's suggestion about choosing and John today talking about choosing the strategic framework, I think that's fine to consider and so forth. But I think \u8211\'20\'13 being a veteran of this war for eight or nine years when I was at the Fed, I think one of the things that the Fed and we often miss in that discussion is, yes, having the strategic framework is important, but where the debates end up occurring is usually at the end of the day not on the goal. It usually ends up a debate about how you get there, the tactics.\par \par \uc2 So we have lots of debates in the (Federal Open Market Committee) about rules versus discretion, strategies to adopt, about how to achieve our best goals. And so I would urge my former colleagues and the new ones in the Fed that if you go down this road of considering a new framework, whether it be price-level targeting or nominal, be sure you think through the implications of that for how will you conduct monetary policy. How will you conduct monetary policy in a credible \u8210\'20\'12 to John's point \u8210\'20\'12 systematic way to achieve those goals? Because without that discussion this is just kind of pie in the sky and you hope that you'll get there.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: And if it makes you feel better, Charles, I think \u8211\'20\'13 I know the two people sitting \u8211\'20\'13 I can probably speak for everyone I know around the table \u8211\'20\'13 I doubt there's anyone around the table that would disagree with what you just said. And I doubt anyone \u8211\'20\'13 I personally, just observing \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 people around the table aren't going to be willing to be supportive of it unless they understand all of the issues you just raised.\par \par \uc2 MR. PLOSSER: And Raphael made the point about implementation becomes critical.\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: No, I agree. And just \u8211\'20\'13 I do want to say, though, that, you know, policy is path-dependent. And we got here through a set of circumstances that I think if we had our druthers wouldn't have happened and we wouldn't be here, right? And so I don't \u8211\'20\'13 I think it's difficult to just talk about this policy as a one-time space without acknowledging that we came through a whole host of challenges. You know, a lot of the forward guidance, a lot of the policy \u8211\'20\'13 articulation of strategy was designed to provide certainty and some stability in a space where there wasn't very much of that. And once you become identified as having that kind of stability, it is very dangerous to start tinkering with that because that could have serious adverse impacts beyond it being the policy itself.\par \par \uc2 Actually, I haven't heard enough about the role of uncertainty today in terms of economic performance. And I know for me, in terms of the things that I spend time on, is, it's how will our policies be perceived relative to the path that has been charted? And deviations from that \u8210\'20\'12 I'm now a Fed guy, so the Fed watchers out there, they really watch us. Like, every word, every step we take. And that has \u8211\'20\'13 can have outsized implications for the response that the market will have to policy. And that's a \u8211\'20\'13 that's a component that I think we've got \u8211\'20\'13 we've got to make sure that what everyone, in a sense \u8211\'20\'13 and you know people watch \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 Q: I'd like to ask this question in the form of a hypothetical. OK, so the hypothetical is at some point, say early next year, inflation is 2.3 or thereabouts, but above 2, and your forecast and the fact the median FOMC member's forecast is for real economic growth to be healthy, say growing 2\u189\'00\'BD or 2\u190\'00\'BE, which is way above your estimate of potential, and your forecast of the unemployment rate is to be where it is now, significantly below the estimate of the natural unemployment. What is your inflation forecast going to be? And if it's higher, which is what the FRB/US model is going to say, what are you going to expect? Or will you say inflation's going to go back to 2 percent? And, if so, what are you going to do with your appropriate dots? (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MS. GEORGE: So in your hypothetical scenario or your thinking, as you know, there are always questions about what other factors may be at play here too. So the committee has not committed to a path today. And notwithstanding the dot plot and the attention it gets, I'm reminded at every meeting how we are constantly recalibrating where we sit today relative to the forecasts that we've set out there.\par \par \uc2 So if what you're suggesting is we can see that there's going to be persistence in this inflation rate, that we're growing above trend, the scenario looks like the economy is overheating, you have to revisit what your path is and think about whether the number of rate increases that you've thought about are going to have to be steeper. And this is always the challenge. This has been a challenge we've known since the day that we did liftoff, which is do we wait and go slow? Is it too \u8211\'20\'13 you know, will we have to go faster at some point? I think we're all mindful of that. So I take your point, and we are where we are.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: Well, can I \u8211\'20\'13 I'll say one thing just so you feel good. (Laughter.) The most important thing I've learned in this job \u8211\'20\'13 and I used to be a leader in business, and I taught leadership for a living \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 to a leader, what's the most important quality? Open to learn. Don't be rigid or predetermined, and certainly don't unduly rely on models or any one \u8211\'20\'13 you know, rigidly, some approach.\par \par \uc2 And I think I've been \u8211\'20\'13 I try to bring that. But I've been extremely impressed as a member of the FOMC \u8211\'20\'13 I've only been here two and a half years. I think that way of thinking \u8211\'20\'13 we listen to all the results of the models and we do all the work, but I think as important there's a whole series of other things. Raphael talked about \u8211\'20\'13 some about them. And I think this group is open to learning. It doesn't mean we won't make mistakes, but I believe we've got an attitude where we're humble, willing to say I don't know, I changed my mind, I've made mistakes. And I think this group's \u8211\'20\'13 from what I've observed, I've got a lot of confidence in this group that it has those qualities.\par \par \uc2 Q: Yeah, I just wanted to \u8211\'20\'13 before I get to my question, I wanted to just amplify what Paul Tucker, (former deputy governor of the Bank of England), said. I think he's right that the U.S. \u8211\'20\'13 the Fed has not usually been the leading innovator in central banking technology and ideas. But there's one exception, and that was (former Fed Chairman) Paul Volcker in 1979, and he really was the leader against inflation. And they did a lot better than we did over in the U.K.\par \par \uc2 But to get to my question, so I was going to ask a question about the effects of the large and rising fiscal deficits and debt-to-GDP in the U.S. on Fed policies.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: So I may talk more about this subject than somebody else. My concern is, through most of our lives, we've increased debt-to-GDP in order to stimulate GDP growth. We're getting very possibly to the stage where, you know, the path now, especially because of \u8211\'20\'13 combine that with demographics in the United States, the path looks more questionable whether it's sustainable.\par \par \uc2 We actually haven't been through a period in my \u8211\'20\'13 I've been through it with companies, but I haven't \u8211\'20\'13 we haven't \u8211\'20\'13\u8210\'20\'12I don't think we've been through it in this country where we've had to either moderate debt growth or actually deleverage, which could actually create a headwind for economic growth. And, for me at least, it means to me, where we are, we have to take that into account.\par \par \uc2 And so when I say things are good in the short term, I'm very mindful of the fact we just had a very large fiscal stimulus, that the underlying drivers of economic growth would not dramatically change. And I hope they do. I hope we make investments and make policy decisions to address them. But I think, for me, it increases the likelihood that out-year growth is going to be sluggish or disappointing. That would be my take on it.\par \par \uc2 MS. GEORGE: One of the things I think about, Michael, is the experience we had in '90 and '91 and the political pressure that the Fed came under. And so, as we sit in a rising rate environment \u8211\'20\'13 and that was my point. As I look at the increasing willingness of Congress to reach in, for example, to the reserve banks for funding, obviously it doesn't affect our ability to operate, but those optics, those practices, I think, begin to chip away at issues around independence. So coming into a time of rising rates when you see these debt levels, I think you have to keep that in the back of your mind, that those \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you. I have a question for President Kaplan and President George.\par \par \uc2 So you mentioned the leverage ratio proposal, but there was, of course, also recently a proposal to change the day-to-day capital requirements to include the stress capital buffer, which, in effect, is basically just adding a (global systemically important bank holding company) surcharge to the post-stress \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 rate. So it's very much a \u8210\'20\'12 so there's been very much a recalibration away from a leverage ratio, risk-blind measure for the largest banks \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 more robust set of requirements for the largest banks. And simultaneously, the stress tests that are going on right now, you know, include increases in the unemployment rate and declines in house prices, (commercial real estate) prices, and stock prices, as well as widenings in the BBB spread that are greater than \u8210\'20\'12 all of which was worse than what was seen in the crisis.\par \par \uc2 So I just wanted to ask, it seems to me that those changes meet the criteria you described of being, you know \u8211\'20\'13 applying tougher standards as \u8211\'20\'13 you know, as things continue to improve and of maintaining very strict requirements on the largest banks, and I \u8211\'20\'13 and I think quite in a desirable way moving away from a leverage \u8211\'20\'13 binding leverage requirement. I just \u8211\'20\'13 I just wanted your perspectives on those two things.\par \par \uc2 MS. GEORGE: So, first of all, your stress tests are only as good as what you're modeling, and so you are putting a great deal of faith in the calibration of your models. And I'm going to assume that those scenarios are as good as we can do, and I'm supportive of running those stress tests. But we know from our experience around risk-based capital and how we calibrate that that the leverage ratio is a stronger measure.\par \par \uc2 I do not see evidence that it creates incentives for risk, particularly when you combine it with the (comprehensive capital analysis and review) exercise that we do. And I think, given the experience of 2008 and '9 and my own experience going back to the '80s, that leverage ratio is not a constraint in terms of lending. In fact, you see that it becomes a source of funds. It becomes a source of strength, actually, when doing that. So, given the systemic risk posed and the amount of leverage in the banking system relative to any other corporate form, I think that ought to be our strong bias in terms of strengthening the system.\par \par \uc2 I think what we've seen so far as that leverage ratio has raised is that we have become far more competitive worldwide. We have become really the strongest banking system. And I don't see any reason that we ought to deviate from that.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: I wouldn't add anything to that. I think we can debate exactly how we do it and why, and I think those are good arguments, and I'm openminded as to the best way to go about it. But I \u8211\'20\'13 directionally, you hear where I'm coming from. I think for the big banks, I don't think the country is being hurt at all. In fact, I think it's being helped by having tough capital requirements, stress testing. And whether it's a buffer or a leverage, I'm openminded to different ways to do this. But I think it should be tough and we're well-served.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, I do think we need to be giving regulatory relief to small- and mid-sized banks. I think that will stir business growth.\par \par \uc2 MR. PLOSSER: And Andy, I guess, the last question.\par \par \uc2 Q: So I have a question picking up on Mickey's question, but I want to pose it in terms of the dual mandate and the status of the dual mandate. A number of your colleagues \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 mentioned a term, too, which is "overheating." And a lot of people outside the United States are wondering what the Fed means when it utters the word "overheating," because it's relatively a new word to hear from the Fed and it's come up this year.\par \par \uc2 And so what we're trying to figure out, is this just a code word for medium-term inflation risk? Or is it something\u8210\'20\'12\u8211\'20\'13 or does it have something to do with the dual mandate? Is it something about noninflationary overheating where you could get \u8211\'20\'13 say our Phillips curve models, as Raphael was saying, our models are not doing so well, inflation models are not doing particularly well. Can we get overheating without inflation and that would, given the dual mandate, lead the Fed to normalize at a quicker pace? Or is it all tied completely to inflation?\par \par \uc2 MR. BOSTIC: So I'm happy to talk first on this. For me \u8211\'20\'13 overheating, to me, means that economic performance in terms of GDP growth as well as pricing both starts to go well beyond what we think is sustainable in the \u8211\'20\'13 in the short to medium term. Because if we move beyond sustainable \u8211\'20\'13 and this is something that my colleagues and my staff have really impressed upon me \u8211\'20\'13 once it breaks down, it ends badly. And the Fed historically has not shown a real ability to prevent that momentum from leading to extra disruption. So, to the extent that we can start to see signs that the economy is getting close to an unsustainable level \u8211\'20\'13 and I think that unsustainability includes both dimensions \u8210\'20\'12 that would be a signal for us that we then need to try to prevent a snapback that leads to excess disruption.\par \par \uc2 MR. KAPLAN: And just to \u8211\'20\'13 I agree with everything Raphael said.\par \par \uc2 For me, I am very conscious of the fact that the structure of the economy, I believe, has changed dramatically in the last number of years. Particularly we've always had \u8211\'20\'13 we've always had forms of automation, but this \u8211\'20\'13 what I've seen, at least in my business career \u8211\'20\'13 and I've spent my career dealing with businesses \u8211\'20\'13 this is something different. I think it's probably the proliferation of cloud computing, other ways where pricing power of business is much more challenged than I've seen any time in my career. And the ability for businesses to be disrupted is accelerating. \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , other things that were unthinkable are accelerating.\par \par \uc2 So, to Raphael's point, I'm mindful of the fact you could \u8211\'20\'13 we could dramatically overshoot full employment. And even though in the near term we don't seem to be seeing as much inflation as we think, I'm sensitive to the fact it may take a little longer for those pressures to build because you've got this headwind. But that doesn't mean pressures are not building. And you've got to be aware, even though you can't \u8210\'20\'12 the data doesn't show you as much inflation as you think, that does not mean you're not going to see it. It just may take a little longer. There may be a greater lag, and you've got this structural \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 And so I think this balanced \u8211\'20\'13 I think the Fed has been well-served by this balanced approach where you've taken perhaps the degree of the overshoot in full employment as well as the degree of the undershoot of inflation and you balance those two, understanding there may be more of a lag. I think there may be more of a lag, and we're doing a lot of work on this. We have a conference, actually, in three weeks, which you're welcome to come to, in Dallas to talk about this, whether there isn't more of a lag because of structural changes. And so I'm sensitive to that.\par \par \uc2 We don't know the answer. We'll know in hindsight, but I think we've got to be sensitive to that.\par \par \uc2 MS. GEORGE: I am just going to end where you started, Charlie, and say I'm careful to think only about two variables, unemployment rate and inflation right now, when I think our mandate is broader. And this idea of sustainable, productive growth in the economy I think is hard to define sometimes when we see the Phillips curve relationships make us raise questions, we see the unemployment rate dropping. So I think there are a number of variables that have to come into play. And maybe using the word "overheating" is too ambiguous, so good of you to call that out.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROFR20180507ee57000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Among the risk-hungry investors was the Asian arm of \uc2 Texas Pacific Group\uc2 , the private equity firm. Another was \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2  founder \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 When Korea First was sold five years later for about $3.4bn, it was a huge payday for TPG and a career-making deal for Shan Weijian, the economist-turned-investor who was in charge of it. But Mr Son missed out, having sold his stake to New York-based \uc2 Cerberus Capital Management\uc2  three years earlier. His impatience cost him, according to people familiar with the sale.\par \par \uc2 For much of Mr Son\u8217\'20\'19s remarkable career, he has been called impulsive and impatient by some of the investors and entrepreneurs who have done business with him. Yet others say he is nothing short of a visionary \u8212\'20\'14 an image he has worked hard to cultivate. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is easier to see 30 years ahead than three years ahead,\u8221\'20\'1D he likes to say.\par \par \uc2 Visionary or not, there is little doubt Mr Son has become a disruptive force in the world of technology investment. In the past two years, SoftBank\u8217\'20\'19s investment holding company has drawn comparisons to \uc2 Warren Buffett\u8217\'20\'19s Berkshire Hathaway\uc2 , with $217bn under management, according to data from McKinsey. He has used this war chest to go on an investment spree, buying multibillion-dollar stakes in young companies from Uber to WeWork. Rivals in Silicon Valley and Asia are feeling anxious.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 His commanding position has prompted a debate. Is Mr Son the best thing that ever happened to technology start-ups? Or is he playing with fire?\par \par \uc2 Mr Son says he is investing to take advantage of \u8220\'20\'1Cthe greatest paradigm shift in human history,\u8221\'20\'1D which requires big, bold bets. He frequently speaks of his ambition \u8220\'20\'1Cto create a new lifestyle for mankind\u8221\'20\'1D and says he wishes to build the biggest information highways in the world. \u8220\'20\'1CSingularity\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 the point when \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  exceeds that of the human brain \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1Cis the biggest gold rush,\u8221\'20\'1D he intones.\par \par \uc2 To his admirers, he is the man who sees the future. \u8220\'20\'1CHe is disintermediating every vertical,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ming Maa, president of the Singapore ride-sharing app Grab and a former SoftBank executive, using tech-speak for the way Mr Son is disrupting industries both new and old.\par \par \uc2 This article is from the Nikkei Asian Review, a global publication with a uniquely Asian views on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their perspectives on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan.\par \par \uc2 Subscribe | Group subscriptions\par \par \uc2 The founders of Grab and Indian peer Ola say Mr Son is the least conflicted, most supportive, most patient investor on the planet. \u8220\'20\'1CHe is inspiring and aggressive and a visionary. He is making history,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Bhavish Aggarwal\uc2 , Ola\u8217\'20\'19s co-founder. \u8220\'20\'1CHe is a great dealmaker and risk taker.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Yet his critics say he is an inveterate gambler, adds little value, and has a short attention span, no sense of fiduciary obligations and a dangerous addiction to using leverage. For sceptics of Mr Son\u8217\'20\'19s investment skills, the terms of the April 29 announcement of a merger between \uc2 Sprint\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 which SoftBank acquired for $20bn in 2013 \u8212\'20\'14 and \uc2 T-Mobile\uc2  are a case in point. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  will end up with a 27 per cent stake in the carrier if regulators approve the $59bn all-stock transaction, less than if Mr Son had not thwarted earlier talks by insisting on control. \uc2 Sprint\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s shares fell 15 per cent on the Monday after the deal was announced.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have never seen anything like SoftBank,\u8221\'20\'1D said the head of investment in Beijing for one major tech company. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is not like the culture of venture capital. Son makes every decision. With a lot of money at low cost and a long horizon, he has totally disrupted the VC industry. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  gives out 10 times more [money] and lots of companies don\u8217\'20\'19t know how to spend those amounts. The outcome is not always optimal.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Most conventional private equity and venture capital investors represent the other extreme. They impose far stricter conditions on the companies they invest in. They have little tolerance for burning through cash for years on end and often try to list companies before they are ready, entrepreneurs say.\par \par \uc2 Mr Son\u8217\'20\'19s investments span the globe. They embrace the $31bn acquisition of semiconductor maker Arm in the UK, and ride-sharing apps across Asia. These holdings include a $5.5bn stake in \uc2 Didi Chuxing\uc2  in China, $1.1bn in Ola and $2.5bn in Grab \u8212\'20\'14 and that was before his $7bn investment in Uber a few months ago, which led to the subsequent withdrawal of Uber from south-east Asia.\par \par \uc2 He claims to have stakes in five of the 10 biggest internet companies in the world and is well on his way to fulfilling his ambition of \u8220\'20\'1Ccreating a virtual Silicon Valley in SoftBank\u8221\'20\'1D, as he describes it. He is also using his money to create monopolies, as he is doing with ride-sharing, across the world.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou can\u8217\'20\'19t play in only one geography; he plays the world while investing in local champions,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ola\u8217\'20\'19s Mr Aggarwal.\par \par \uc2 There is a darker side to that as well. \u8220\'20\'1CSon-san is the market \u8212\'20\'14 you buy the whole industry and you become the whole market,\u8221\'20\'1D said another Indian entrepreneur with SoftBank money, explaining his strategy.\par \par \uc2 Having more money than anyone else \u8212\'20\'14 and giving young companies far more money than anyone else would be willing to invest in them \u8212\'20\'14 has made Mr Son\u8217\'20\'19s formula look unassailable. But there are vulnerabilities that a rising market has so far obscured \u8212\'20\'14 at least most of the time.\par \par \uc2 To some, Mr Son\u8217\'20\'19s recent investment frenzy looks eerily familiar. He lost tens of billions on a string of investments on internet companies during the dotcom bubble years. Asked in a March 2017 interview with Nikkei if he regretted those investment decisions, Mr Son paused before talking not about the losses but about his failure to spend even more.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CJust after the dotcom bubble burst, SoftBank\u8217\'20\'19s share price fell to a 100th of what it was, but I said at the time, \u8216\'20\'18Now is the biggest opportunity to invest in internet companies,\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Son replied.\par \par \uc2 Instead of going bargain-hunting in the dotcom wreckage, he challenged \uc2 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone\uc2 , Japan\u8217\'20\'19s marquee telecom group, in a race to bring broadband to the Japanese market. Those broadband operations, which required massive infrastructure investments, turned into financial sinkholes that caused SoftBank to log four straight years of losses. Ultimately, however, those investments led to lower prices, boosting the fortunes of Japanese internet companies.\par \par \uc2 Although Mr Son takes pride in that achievement, he still regrets missing out on the chance to buy stakes in \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2  and Baidu, China\u8217\'20\'19s leading search engine, in the early 2000s. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19ve thought a lot about what would have happened if I didn\u8217\'20\'19t do broadband at the time and instead used all the money left over to invest in internet companies,\u8221\'20\'1D he admitted. \u8220\'20\'1CI believe I could\u8217\'20\'19ve come into possession of a global tech giant if I had done that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But he can still claim a major victory from that period: the stake in Alibaba he purchased in 2000. Mr Son has said that he decided to invest only five minutes into his first meeting with chairman \uc2 Jack Ma\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CI saw charisma in his eyes,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Son said in the interview last year.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 His gut feeling was correct. The $20m investment he made in Alibaba in 2000 was worth at least $70bn when the Chinese ecommerce company listed in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Such prescience must have been on the mind of \uc2 Prince Mohammed bin Salman\uc2  of Saudi Arabia in Tokyo in September 2016. It was there that Mr Son persuaded \uc2 Prince Mohammed\uc2  \u8220\'20\'1Cto invest $45bn in 45 minutes\u8221\'20\'1D, he told his envious interlocutor, \uc2 David Rubenstein\uc2 , co-founder of Carlyle, in an interview for \uc2 Bloomberg Television\uc2  last fall.\par \par \uc2 That was the start of the Vision Fund, the largest single fund on the planet and a catalyst for the transformation of SoftBank as well as its founder. The Vision Fund is unique, given its relative lack of constraints and clear return targets, and its open-ended structure.\par \par \uc2 The Vision Fund came at a fortuitous time for Mr Son. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  has so much debt \u8212\'20\'14 about $145bn, though this will fall significantly if the tie-up between \uc2 Sprint\uc2  and \uc2 T-Mobile\uc2  is approved \u8212\'20\'14 that he could never use his own balance sheet in the way Alibaba and Tencent use theirs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2  is becoming an investment company, and as it becomes an investment company, leverage is no longer an appropriate measure,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Yoshimitsu Goto\uc2 , SoftBank\u8217\'20\'19s chief financial officer, in March. \u8220\'20\'1CBy using the Vision Fund and the Delta Fund, we can use leverage without damaging our balance sheet.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Crucially, by using the Vision Fund, Mr Son can also spend other people\u8217\'20\'19s money \u8212\'20\'14 and spend it aggressively.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI postpone profits for market share,\u8221\'20\'1D he once explained to television interviewer \uc2 Charlie Rose\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CI am in a hurry to aggregate. I aggressively engage in price competition.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Vision Fund has relatively little time pressure, which means SoftBank does not have to worry about generating positive cash flow in the companies in which it takes a stake. The size of the fund, however, can be a curse as much as a blessing for both giver and recipient.\par \par \uc2 In order to \u8220\'20\'1Caggregate\u8221\'20\'1D, Mr Son offers the highest valuation when he finds himself bidding in competitive situations. As long as the market rises, propelled by ever larger amounts of money coming into tech, SoftBank appears invulnerable \u8212\'20\'14 and Mr Son appears to have turned himself into a sort of perpetual moneymaking machine. The danger, though, comes when the market stops rising.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe has convinced himself the world will be different 20 years from now but that is dangerous,\u8221\'20\'1D said one Hong Kong-based tech investor who has dealt with Mr Son. \u8220\'20\'1CIn tech, you can\u8217\'20\'19t look 30 years out \u8212\'20\'14 at most you can look three to five years out.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A leading venture capitalist in India said: \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 SoftBank\uc2  makes the cost of capital so low for entrepreneurs [that it] gives rise to bad habits like cash burn and just going for market share.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCapital efficiency goes out the window. Capital can crown the wrong winner.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 High valuations can become a trap for entrepreneurs, too. Because few other investors believe in the values Mr Son\u8217\'20\'19s investments give to young companies, they can only attract SoftBank money when they need a new round of funding \u8212\'20\'14 or they must contemplate the prospect of a lower valuation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn hindsight, I would have done things differently,\u8221\'20\'1D said one Indian entrepreneur with SoftBank money. \u8220\'20\'1CI would have kept more control in return for a lower valuation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In recent months, \u8220\'20\'1CSon is the new IPO\u8221\'20\'1D has become the mantra among venture capitalists who try to convince him to buy the companies they have invested in because he will give them a higher valuation than the public market.\par \par \uc2 Consider \uc2 Coupang\uc2 , among the largest start-ups in the history of South Korea. Three years ago, the ecommerce company raised $1bn from a group led by SoftBank. But \uc2 Coupang\uc2  burns capital at an alarming rate, and has reported losses far bigger than the market has expected, according to people in the industry. If it were to raise money today it would likely be at a lower valuation.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Similarly, Paytm in India, in which SoftBank has a 20 per cent stake, needs \u8220\'20\'1Ccontinuous\u8221\'20\'1D capital, according to its founder, \uc2 Vijay Shekhar Sharma\uc2 . That translates into saying the company will not generate positive cash flow on its own for the conceivable future.\par \par \uc2 These are just short-term concerns for Mr Son, who says he wants to create a group that will last for centuries. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat did \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2  invent?\u8221\'20\'1D he asked in a 2010 presentation, thinking of how he would be remembered. \u8220\'20\'1CIf one were to bring up one thing, it would be neither a chip, a software nor a piece of hardware. I wish for future generations to say he created an organisational body that has grown for 300 years.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Whatever the future holds, Mr Son has always done things his own way, combining a strong sense of being an outsider with an equally strong belief in his own capabilities. In an interview with the Harvard Business Review back in 1992, he described \u8220\'20\'1Cthe darkness in my mind because of my nationality. I think most Koreans who live in Japan have the same feeling. They use their Japanese last names and feel like they are hiding something.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Mr Son\u8217\'20\'19s vision is inspired by his father, Mitsunori Son, who made bootleg liquor, ran pachinko parlours and engaged in consumer lending. He says his idea about running SoftBank was formed by watching his father attempt to run a variety of businesses.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 While he may have harboured doubts about his fundamental identity, Mr Son has never had any doubt about his charm as a salesman. He approached his business hero, \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2 , to ask for the exclusive right to market the iPhone in Japan even before he acquired \uc2 Vodafone Japan\uc2  in a $15bn deal in 2006, he says.\par \par \uc2 Taking such risks has so far worked out. But that apparent success also reflects today\u8217\'20\'19s benign financial conditions, with low interest rates and ample liquidity. These conditions may soon turn. Interest rates have started to move up in the US far more quickly than most analysts have expected, which means investors may soon be forced to become less ebullient. If the tightening continues, Mr Son may not look quite as successful tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 But he has already been there. At the end of the dotcom bubble, he lost 99 per cent of his own net worth, yet he bounced back.\par \par \uc2 Could it happen again? Mr Son does not rule it out. \u8220\'20\'1CI was so close to falling down from the cliff,\u8221\'20\'1D he told Mr Rubenstein with a laugh. \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t know if I can do it again.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A version of this article was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on May 2, 2018. \u169\'00\'A92018 \uc2 Nikkei Inc\uc2 .

But how low can joblessness fall, and for how long, before a boon for the economy turns into a burden for everyone?\par \par \uc2 Since the end of the most recent recession, U.S. unemployment has fallen from nearly 10% to 3.9% in April. If unemployment runs too low for too long, inflation or dangerous financial bubbles could build. The last three times the jobless rate has moved below 4%\u8212\'20\'14in the 1950s, 1960s and late 1990s\u8212\'20\'14the U.S. got one of those outcomes and recession eventually followed.\par \par \uc2 Economists and central bankers have long tried to put numbers to the Goldilocks fable. They pay close attention to a theoretical threshold at which the economy is in balance and inflation pressures are neither rising nor falling, called the "nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment," or Nairu. Go much above or below Nairu, the theory holds, and you've got trouble.\par \par \uc2 The difficulty officials face in assessing Nairu is that it's a moving target. In 2000, the jobless rate went below 4% for just five months before problems ensued\u8212\'20\'14a tech bubble burst that led to recession. In the late 1960s, on the other hand, it stayed below 4% for nearly four years, leading to inflation and a decade of economic malaise.\par \par \uc2 Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , says Nairu is the economics profession's Loch Ness monster: You might think you've seen it, but it's always hard to know.\par \par \uc2 Over the past seven decades, Nairu has ranged from about 4.6% to just over 6%, according to the \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2 's economic projections.\par \par \uc2 Complicating matters, Nairu estimates rely on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fed-has-a-theory-trouble-is-the-proof-is-patchy-1440352846"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a contentious theory}}}\uc2  that falling unemployment pushes up prices and wages. That relationship appears to have broken down in recent years, when inflation remained below the Federal Reserve's 2% target even as the jobless rate steadily declined.\par \par \uc2 There are several explanations for why. Nairu itself might not be a useful guide. Or the U.S. might not be at full employment yet. The White House's chief economist, Kevin Hassett, said last month that full employment "could be in the threes now."\par \par \uc2 A broader measure of unemployment that includes workers stuck in part-time jobs or too discouraged to search for work remains high, suggesting slack remains in the labor market. The measure fell to 7.8% in April from 8% in March, whereas in December 2000 it stood at 6.9%.\par \par \uc2 Former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder points to his "traumatized worker" theory. "Workers still remember the bad old days and they're more interested in job security than they are in seeking out a raise," he said.\par \par \uc2 This time around, some economists worry that low inflation, low unemployment and historically low short-term interest rates could be a recipe for a different problem, potentially disastrous financial bubbles. The past two recessions were ushered in by a rise and subsequent collapse in asset prices. In both cases, the unemployment rate dropped to low levels as asset prices soared, hitting 3.8% in April 2000 and 4.4% in October 2006.\par \par \uc2 Signs of financial excess are building now. Net wealth of American households\u8212\'20\'14driven by their stock, bond and real-estate investments\u8212\'20\'14was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-household-net-worth-rises-in-4th-quarter-on-higher-stock-home-values-1520528423"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 nearly seven times their income}}}\uc2  in the fourth quarter of 2017, above levels seen during the Nasdaq bubble and the housing boom.\par \par \uc2 The Federal Reserve's job is to manage the heat on Goldilocks' porridge pot by moving interest rates higher and lower. It pushes interest rates down when it wants to spur economic growth by encouraging businesses and households to invest and spend more. It pushes interest rates up when it wants to cool investing, spending and growth.\par \par \uc2 The Fed's rough estimate for Nairu is now around 4.5%. Officials project the actual jobless rate will drop to 3.8% by end of this year and reach 3.6% in 2019 and 2020. That suggests the Fed is prepared to let the unemployment rate fall to a level not seen since the late 1960s before it would cool the heat by considering a more aggressive pace of rate increases.\par \par \uc2 One big risk faced by the Fed: Once it lets the economy go too far in one direction, it is hard to turn it around. When the unemployment rate gets very low and then starts rising, it tends to rise a lot.\par \par \uc2 "The Fed has never been able to get the unemployment rate up from significantly below Nairu back to Nairu without a recession ensuing," Deutsche Bank economist Peter Hooper said on a panel at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 The Fed expects it will raise short-term interest rates two more times this year, in quarter-percentage-point increments. If the unemployment rate steams lower, the Fed might find itself moving more aggressively than planned.\par \par \uc2 Eric Morath contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Harriet Torry at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:harriet.torry@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 harriet.torry@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stocks-and-bonds-are-going-nowhere-fast-stranding-investors-1525622400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Markets Run Fast Only to Stay in Place}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-costs-how-much-how-the-oil-rally-took-forecasters-by-surprise-1525608000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Forecaster Fail: Missing Oil's Rise}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-economy-week-ahead-china-trade-balance-u-s-inflation-boe-meeting-1525633201"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Economic Calendar: China Trade Balance, BOE Meeting}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20180506ee5600001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

In early April last year, the carmaker's founder at one point gleefully tweeted: "Stormy weather in Shortville" as Tesla's stock headed towards what would be a 46 per cent gain for the year.\par \par \uc2 But concerns over Tesla's cash burn have weighed on its stock and bonds in 2018, and an earnings call on Wednesday that analysts described as "surreal", a "circus", "odd" and a "unique experience" soured sentiment further.\par \par \uc2 Tesla's stock ended Thursday 5.6 per cent lower, leaving it down more than 4 per cent for the week. The price of its $1.8bn bond maturing in 2025 has tumbled from trading near par at the start of the year to 87.3 cents on the dollar, or a yield of 7.5 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Investors have been intensifying bets against Tesla in recent weeks, and the company is comfortably the most shorted in America, with "short interest" at nearly $12bn. Those bets were still underwater this week, but Thursday's tumble produced a $662m paper profit for short sellers, according to S3 Partners. The year-to-date profit is now $645m, it calculated.\par \par \uc2 Tesla's conference call \u8212\'20\'14 where Mr Musk interrupted a question about whether it would need to raise more money by saying "boring bonehead questions are not cool" and instead took questions from retail investors on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 caused mirth at a conference for short sellers in New York.\par \par \uc2 At one point \uc2 David Einhorn\uc2 , a prominent hedge fund manager who has bet against Tesla, was asked about whether there were any particular companies in his "bubble basket" that he would like to discuss, and quipped: "That's a really boring question. Let's go to \uc2 YouTube\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 George Schultze\uc2  of \uc2 Schultze Asset Management\uc2 , which has a short position on Tesla, said that while the carmaker "unquestionably has some good products", it was still "over-levered and has a cash flow problem". He added: "The business plan is highly dependent on Tesla accessing the capital markets for additional cash. To say that it is not necessary and to cut analysts off and say the questions are boring and irrelevant is immature at best and certainly not a 'cool' way to operate the company."\par \par \uc2 Jim Chanos\uc2 , a hedge fund manager specialising in short selling, has long been one of Tesla's biggest critics, and has been betting against it for four years. In late April, he took to CNBC again to highlight the "torrent" of executives leaving Tesla, and impending competition from other big carmakers. "Now the big boys are coming, and they're coming with sexy-looking cars at the same price point with better features," he said.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock, Chloe Cornish and Robert Smith See Editorial Comment\par \par \uc2 'The big boys are coming, and they're coming with sexy-looking cars at the same price point'\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180505ee55000ee\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

This mirrors similar staff moves to Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan.\par \par \uc2 Ranked number two in equities trading globally, Goldman trails \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  as Europe's largest equities brokers, according to data from Coalition, an industry monitor. Brokers also say \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  is pushing hard to win market share. Nevertheless, Goldman is used by large fund managers such as \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , \uc2 Legal & General\uc2  and Aviva. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Like US rivals, it is looking to take advantage of Europe\u8217\'20\'19s new Mifid II legislation to grab market share. Mifid II banned trading by banks on their own internal trading desks, in an effort to increase transparency and make the best market prices available to all investors.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 But the rules also allowed banks and high-frequency trading to run lightly-regulated platforms \u8212\'20\'14 known as\u160\'00\'A0 \u8220\'20\'1Csystematic internalisers\u8221\'20\'1D if they trade orders on behalf of clients.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Pantor\u8217\'20\'19s technology, which had a reputation in the market for speed and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , has been harnessed by Goldman to replace its equity trading system using this technology. The bank aims to make Stockholm a research and development hub for its securities operation.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe firm is trying to be really leading edge in this, having learnt a lot from electronification of the equities market,\u8221\'20\'1D said Elizabeth Martin, head of Emea execution services at Goldman. \u8220\'20\'1CAs we build out these technologies, we should export them to other asset classes.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 SI venues ease standards around minimum quote sizes and trade reporting. They account for about 15 per cent of the European market, up from 2 per cent just before Christmas.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 At the same time, larger brokers with better credit ratings have been using their balance sheets to take customers orders\u8217\'20\'19 and work them into the market over time.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is more about Mifid II and us having a differentiated platform, which we are looking to build up in our centre of expertise in Stockholm,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms Martin.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Using Pantor technology, Goldman is creating a network of other SIs and exchanges, and linking them with a high-speed smart order router, which would direct customers to the best price on the market.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Goldman expects to have moved about 90 per cent of its European equity trading business on to Pantor by the end of June. The project was spearheaded by \uc2 Mike Blum\uc2 , the former chief technology officer at KCG Holdings, the high-frequency trader bought by \uc2 Virtu Financial\uc2  last year.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The Swedish capital has become a hub for developers in trading and risk software for the world's financial markets. Local companies such as \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 , Cinnober and \uc2 TriOptima\uc2  are widely used by global banks and exchanges to run critical operations.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 More than two dozen institutions have adopted the SI status, including Goldman, \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , \uc2 Barclays\uc2  and \uc2 UBS\uc2  as well as proprietary trading firms and market makers such as Tower Research Capital, Citadel Securities and Virtu.\par \par \uc2 Goldman executives say the atmosphere in its Stockholm office is more like a fintech start-up than an investment bank: there is a relaxed dress code and shoes are swapped for slippers at the door.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe laboratory environment is much quieter and has more of a homely feel, where you can think and develop, unlike a trading floor, which can be quite intense when things are happening in the markets,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms Martin. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are very excited about the quality of the local engineering talent in Stockholm.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180504ee54000se\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Mr. Quarles has already put a rethink of these rules on the agenda, and Friday he could give more details about his plans. Here's what to look out for:\par \par \uc2 Super-regional banks: One of the new liquidity rules, the liquidity coverage ratio or LCR, has in particular squeezed a group of banks that aren't considered globally systemically important, but still have more than $250 billion in assets. This group includes \uc2 PNC Financial Services Group Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 U.S. Bancorp\uc2 . Mr. Quarles has signaled he wants to help these firms, offering the LCR to Congress last month as an example of "further measures we can take to match the content of our regulation to the character and risk of the institutions being regulated." Look for more details on tailoring the ratio.\par \par \uc2 The net stable funding ratio: This is the second liquidity rule regulators invented. It targets longer-term liquidity as opposed to shorter-term liabilities. The Fed proposed this rule before Mr. Quarles arrived. He has said he wants to finish it but it isn't clear what form that would take. It will be worth listening for an outline of how he is approaching this matter.\par \par \uc2 The Fed's balance sheet: This is a significant issue in monetary policy after the growth of the Fed's balance sheet following the financial crisis. Mr. Quarles could add his thoughts to the continuing debate. He could also comment on the way liquidity rules interact with monetary policy, a notion worth paying attention to because it could motivate how the Fed shapes these rules in the future.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 PHH Decides Not to Appeal CFPB Case to Supreme Court\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/phh-decides-not-to-appeal-cfpb-case-to-supreme-court-1525369924"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A court ruling upholding}}}\uc2  the single-director structure of the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  will endure for now, after the mortgage lender that brought the case decided not to appeal to the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The decision by \uc2 PHH Corp\uc2 . not to appeal the case, in which it had argued the independent federal agency's structure is unconstitutional, follows a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January that represented a partial but practical victory for the company.\par \par \uc2 The appeals court had rejected the company's challenge against the bureau's structure. But it also invalidated a $109 million fine levied against the company by the CFPB, which had found PHH violated a federal law on real-estate settlement procedures.\par \par \uc2 SEC Probes Sale of Jay-Z's Clothing Brand\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-probes-sale-of-jay-zs-clothing-brand-1525366068"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Wall Street's chief regulator}}}\uc2  is about to do battle with the King of New York.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  said Thursday that it asked a federal judge to order Jay-Z to talk to investigators about the sale of his \uc2 Rocawear\uc2  brand to \uc2 Iconix Brand Group Inc\uc2 . The SEC said the New York rapper hasn't complied with a February subpoena seeking his testimony.\par \par \uc2 Iconix\uc2  bought the brand assets of \uc2 Rocawear\uc2  in 2007 for $200 million. It later wrote down the entire value of the asset, the SEC said. The SEC sought the judge's order through an action filed in Manhattan-based federal court.\par \par \uc2 Former Jefferies Trader Litvak's Conviction Is Tossed Out\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-jefferies-trader-litvaks-conviction-is-tossed-out-1525376517"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A U.S. appeals court vacated}}}\uc2  the conviction of former Jefferies Group LLC trader Jesse Litvak, the latest turn in a case that has spanned more than five years and helped usher in changes to sales tactics on Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Litvak had been convicted of securities fraud related to the sale of residential mortgage-backed bonds and has been serving a two-year prison sentence.

Chief Executive \uc2 James Gorman\uc2 , at a Swiss Alps conference, defended the move in a television interview. "If you're really unhappy," he told employees, "just leave."\par \par \uc2 The comment in 2012 rocketed around \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's trading floor 4,000 miles away. In Switzerland, some of Mr. Gorman's top deputies, including star merger banker \uc2 Paul Taubman\uc2 , grumbled about the public rebuke, say people familiar with the episode.\par \par \uc2 Six years later, Mr. Gorman's take-it-or-leave-it discipline has transformed Wall Street's problem child into one of its steadiest performers. Its 2017 profits were nearly triple those of 2014. Its market value, as low as $7 billion during the financial crisis, surpassed $100 billion earlier this year. \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  is more valuable on paper than \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., once Wall Street's undisputed king.\par \par \uc2 Profiting From Wall Street Fear is No Longer Easy for Cboe\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-profiting-from-wall-street-fear-is-no-longer-easy-for-cboe-1525339801"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Anxiety is back on Wall Street.}}}\uc2  That should be good news for \uc2 Cboe Global Markets Inc\uc2 ., the operator of the VIX index of expected stock swings, widely known as the market's fear gauge.\par \par \uc2 But Cboe shares have tumbled 14% this year, lagging far behind both the broader stock market and the firm's peers. Questions about the reliability of volatility trading\u8212\'20\'14punctuated by the one-day February market crash and a rarely seen wobble last month that raised concerns about possible manipulation\u8212\'20\'14are dimming enthusiasm for the VIX just at the time when it would seem most attractive.\par \par \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2  Offers Cheap Loans to Affordable-Housing Landlords\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/freddie-mac-offers-cheap-loans-to-affordable-housing-landlords-1525348800"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Freddie Mac, the country's largest}}}\uc2  backer of apartment loans, will offer low-cost loans to real-estate owners willing to keep their buildings affordable to middle-class families for years to come.\par \par \uc2 The move could open up a new approach to creating and preserving middle-class housing. It uses market incentives rather than government subsidies to persuade real-estate companies to preserve units for the middle of the rental market, an area of concern for policy makers in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Regulators Eye Second Most Valuable Cryptocurrency\par \par \uc2 Until now, regulators hadn't questioned whether rules designed for stocks should apply to virtual currencies such as ether, the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin with a market value of $67 billion. But regulators are examining {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/worlds-second-most-valuable-cryptocurrency-under-regulatory-scrutiny-1525167000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 whether widely traded cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin should be regulated as securities}}}\uc2 , according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The inquiry includes a focus on ether, representing a significant threat to virtual currencies, which so far haven't been drawn into a regulatory crackdown on potential fraud in the market for the assets. The analysis, by federal securities and commodities regulators, turns on whether the creators of virtual currencies other than bitcoin exert significant influence over their value, in the same way a company's stock price depends on its managers and their strategy, performance and investments, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Under U.S. law, companies that issue stocks or bonds must either register the deal with the SEC\u8212\'20\'14and give investors extensive disclosures\u8212\'20\'14or limit the sale to sophisticated institutions and the rich. Ether's founders didn't register the 2014 sale and sold the coins to anyone willing to buy. Any determination from regulators that ether is a security could spark a wave of selling and rattle major trading venues that allow investors to buy and sell it.\par \par \uc2 Friday, May 4\par \par \uc2 5:30 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles speaks on liquidity regulation at the \uc2 Hoover Institution\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.hoover.org/events/currencies-capital-and-central-bank-balances-policy-conference"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 monetary policy conference}}}\uc2  in Stanford, Calif.\par \par \uc2 Sunday, May 6\par \par \uc2 7 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles speaks on \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  in finance at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.frbatlanta.org/news/conferences-and-events/conferences/2018/0506-financial-markets-conference/agenda"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 financial markets conference}}}\uc2  in Amelia Island, Fla.\par \par \uc2 Monday, May 7\par \par \uc2 NA\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . holds {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.fdic.gov/news/conferences/techforum/agenda.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a daylong forum}}}\uc2  on the use of technology in the banking industry.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday, May 8\par \par \uc2 9 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Practising Law Institute\uc2  hosts {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bit.ly/2rbXeeG"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a webcast seminar}}}\uc2  on the Volcker rule, including how regulators provide and coordinate advice on the rule and how to best comply with the rule.\par \par \uc2 Financial Risk Builds as Dodd-Frank Is Chipped Away\par \par \uc2 The 2010 Dodd-Frank law helped cement financial stability, but the potential for crisis hasn't passed, Nicholas Lemann {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/07/the-dangers-of-undoing-dodd-frank"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 writes for the New Yorker}}}\uc2 . "There are lots of places to chip away at Dodd-Frank, until the changes add up to systemic risk," he says. Deregulation "unfolds step by technical step, across half a dozen federal agencies, with the prospective details revealed in long lists of dense rules," he writes.

"We are spending a good amount of time trying to figure out a way\u8230\'20\'26to allow these new industries to develop without the type of regulation that stifles and while still protecting consumers at the same time."\par \par \uc2 In early 2016, the CFPB said it would begin giving fintech companies a green light indicating their business model has been vetted by regulators, but without any guarantee they could escape being fined or sued later.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB policy has yielded only one participant: an online-lending marketplace called Upstart. Many in the fintech industry complained about the long application process, the lack of full legal cover and concerns over sharing proprietary models with regulators.\par \par \uc2 Now it appears that Mr. Mulvaney, who has retooled the CFPB's mission statement to focus on "making rules more effective," could create a "sandbox" model with added flexibility to entice more fintechs to participate. Some hope this could indicate the agency's fintech initiatives will grow in importance.\par \par \uc2 "We're hopeful that the bureau devotes sufficient resources to making [its fintech arm] more robust," said Brian Peters, the head of Financial Innovation Now, an advocacy group for large technology firms including \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In contrast, it is unclear where the OCC plans to take its fintech-charter proposal, initiated under former head \uc2 Thomas Curry\uc2 , an Obama appointee. The current comptroller, Joseph Otting, has indicated he is still evaluating what to do with the proposal. A legal challenge from state regulators concerned it could allow fintechs to evade local laws was dropped by a federal court on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Some liberals worry Mr. Mulvaney's proposal could give fintech firms free rein to abuse laws if the agency doesn't simultaneously police their excesses.\par \par \uc2 "The term \u8216\'20\'18sandbox' has been thrown around to encompass a lot of different kinds of programs," said \uc2 Lauren Saunders\uc2 , an associate director at the \uc2 National Consumer Law Center\uc2 . "Some are very carefully, narrowly tailored pilot programs. Others are an excuse to allow any company that uses the word \u8216\'20\'18innovation' to escape laws that protect people."\par \par \uc2 The fintech industry remains cautiously optimistic about the CFPB's signals, given that many fintech companies have to answer to multiple regulators at the state and federal level.\par \par \uc2 "One of the challenges of having a fragmented regulatory system is that when one agency is taking a step to promote innovation, the impact may only be felt if other agencies follow suit," said Nat Hoopes, executive director of the Marketplace Lending Association.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 SEC Chief Pitches Investors, Brokers to Back Rule Targeting Stockbroker Conflicts\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chief-pitches-investors-brokers-to-back-rule-targeting-stockbroker-conflicts-1525302080"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Wall Street's chief regulator}}}\uc2  took to the road Wednesday to promote proposed stricter rules on how stocks brokers advise their clients, saying they would help investors and not hurt the brokerage industry.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton told an audience in Philadelphia that the approach is rigorous, "fundamentally right" and should become the standard among federal and state regulators. He argued that the agency's plan would preserve the option for brokers to be compensated through commissions, which for some investors is a cheaper way to pay for advice.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton's remarks are part of an effort to persuade skeptics that the SEC's proposal, released last month, goes far enough to rein in conflicts of interest that can hurt investors.\par \par \uc2 New York Bans NRA Insurance Program and Fines Broker\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-bans-nra-insurance-program-and-fines-broker-1525273379"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 New York financial regulators}}}\uc2  on Wednesday said an insurance program for members of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  violates state law, and have imposed a $7 million fine on the broker who arranged it.\par \par \uc2 The NRA program allows policyholders to buy policies that cover legal costs in self-defense shootings. The "NRA Carry Guard" program is still being marketed, according to the program's website, although sales in New York were suspended last fall shortly after the state's Department of Financial Services launched its probe.\par \par \uc2 Maria T. Vullo, New York's Financial Services Superintendent, said in a news release Wednesday that the investigation concluded that Carry Guard unlawfully provides liability insurance to gun owners for certain acts of intentional wrongdoing. New York state law prohibits that.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone Unit Acknowledges Hovnanian Swaps Backlash\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-unit-acknowledges-hovnanian-swaps-backlash-1525278146"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Blackstone Group LP's GSO Capital Partners}}}\uc2  said it could support "appropriate changes" to credit-default-swap contracts in response to U.S. regulators' apparent concerns around a derivatives trade on \uc2 Hovnanian Enterprises Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Hovnanian skipped an interest payment due Tuesday on bonds it repurchased and parked with an affiliate, opening the door for GSO to collect payouts on credit-default swaps that insure against nonpayment.\par \par \uc2 The missed payment moves GSO's complex trade, hatched on the sidelines of a Miami finance conference, to the actual from the theoretical just as U.S. financial regulators began to weigh in.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  to Pay $6 Million to Former Executive in Dispute Over Trades\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-to-pay-6-million-to-former-executive-in-dispute-over-trades-1525287711"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG agreed to pay}}}\uc2  former executive Colin Fan roughly $6 million to settle a lawsuit he filed over trades that bank lawyers concluded improperly earned him millions of dollars, according to people familiar with the settlement.\par \par \uc2 The agreement is a partial victory for Mr. Fan, who argued that \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  unfairly withheld bonuses he had earned while he worked there. He left the bank in late 2015.\par \par \uc2 The trades in question, first reported by The Wall Street Journal in 2016, started in 2009. They were designed to remove risk \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  had taken when it made a deal to invest roughly $750 million on behalf of an insurance-company client, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the transactions.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Has China Really Kicked Its Debt Addiction?\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/has-china-really-kicked-its-debt-addiction-1525251393"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Here's a widely told yarn:}}}\uc2  Last year China successfully curtailed skyrocketing debt issuance without hurting growth.\par \par \uc2 Like all good tall tales, it has some basis in truth. China's debt-to-GDP ratio did level off in 2017, thanks largely to rebounding exports. What didn't happen was a sharp slowdown in actual borrowing, until the end of 2017\u8212\'20\'14meaning companies are only now feeling the pinch of tighter credit. Chinese property developer Zhonghong Holding Co. last week defaulted on more than $150 million of debt, raising worries that other financially strapped firms may soon follow suit, spooking global markets as happened in 2016.\par \par \uc2 As the stress mounts, investors should expect more Chinese policy easing in the months ahead. \uc2 China's central bank\uc2  already unexpectedly cut banks' reserve ratios last month, releasing about half a trillion yuan ($78 billion) of funds for lending.\par \par \uc2 U.K. to Mandate Public Company Registries in Overseas Territories\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2018/05/01/u-k-to-mandate-public-company-registers-in-overseas-territories/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The U.K. will require its}}}\uc2  overseas territories to develop public registries of the owners of companies formed there, marking a major victory for activists pursuing anti-money laundering reforms.\par \par \uc2 A government minister backed down from earlier-stated opposition to an amendment to a sanctions and anti-money laundering bill that would require such registries from the overseas territories, which include financial hubs such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands.\par \par \uc2 The amendment had cross-party support ahead of a vote Tuesday; it requires the territories establish the registries by the end of 2020.\par \par \uc2 The Cryptocurrency Capital\par \par \uc2 Switzerland, as closely tied to its ultrasafe Swiss franc as it is to the Alps, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/switzerland-wants-to-be-the-world-capital-of-cryptocurrency-1524942058"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 is entranced by volatile digital currencies}}}\uc2 . Buildings in Zug and in Zurich, Switzerland's financial center, are blossoming into crypto-finance hubs.\par \par \uc2 Four of the 10 biggest initial coin offerings last year were in Switzerland, according to PwC, more than any other country. The hope is the country's banking prowess, low taxes, elite universities and the Swiss brand itself will do for Switzerland what Silicon Valley did for the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Efforts to expand the so-called Crypto Valley into what Switzerland's economics minister has called Crypto Nation have seen some success and may offset the country's shrinking banking sector. The number of banks here has fallen 20% in the past decade, according to the \uc2 Swiss Bankers Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Thursday, May 3\par \par \uc2 NA\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  holds its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/events/2018-cfpb-research-conference/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 annual research conference}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 8:15 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  member Russ Behnam speak at the speaks to the \uc2 Futures Industry Association\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://lc2018.fia.org/program/2526"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 law and compliance division conference}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 8:30 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission Chief Accountant Wesley Bricker and Financial Accounting Standards Board Chairman Russell Golden give opening remarks at the Robert Zicklin Center for Corporate Integrity's annual {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/event/the-17th-annual-financial-reporting-conference/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 financial reporting conference}}}\uc2 .

Large firms often have more data to process, and "once processed, that data can better forecast firm value, reduce the risk of equity investment, and thus reduce the firm's cost of capital," they write.\par \par \uc2 Leave Broker Disclosures to the SEC\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  has reasserted its authority to regulate investment brokers, and the Labor Department should accept and collaborate with the SEC's effort, former SEC Commissioner Paul S. Atkins and former labor solicitor Gregory F. Jacob write in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/leave-broker-disclosures-to-the-sec-1525302982"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a commentary for The Wall Street Journal}}}\uc2 . "Whereas the Labor Department's limited statutory authority forced it to adopt a hopelessly convoluted regulatory structure to reach just the narrow slice of broker-dealer conduct that pertains to retirement plans, the SEC is able to supply a single, coherent standard of conduct for all brokers. This protects all investors at all times, while avoiding the costs, conflicts and confusion of a bifurcated regulatory regime," they say. The SEC rule still needs work, but once it is finished "the Labor Department will be in a far better position to assess whether gaps remain for it to fill," they write.\par \par \uc2 Consumer Complaint Database Is Good for Customers and Businesses\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 's public database of grievances about a broad range of financial companies is "an innovation worth preserving," the Bloomberg {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-04-29/save-the-cfpb-s-consumer-complaint-database"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 editorial board writes}}}\uc2 . The transparency of these complaints "pushes companies to be more responsive," "exposes any persistent problems," and provides important performance data for the public and consumers, the board says. Social media or other private initiatives don't provide anything as comprehensive and authoritative as the CFPB data, and the complaints are typically too small to justify the cost and effort of filing a legal suit, the board writes.\par \par \uc2 The popular messaging app Telegram has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/telegram-messaging-app-scraps-plans-for-public-coin-offering-1525281933"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 created a groundswell of enthusiasm in the private markets}}}\uc2  for its next project, which it describes as a digital payments and technology platform that will appeal to a wider audience than established virtual currencies like bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 The Treasury Department is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-announces-additional-increases-to-auction-sizes-1525265536"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 slowly ramping up its debt auctions}}}\uc2  to meet the federal government's growing need for borrowed money.\par \par \uc2 Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.

The rapid growth of online sales, combined {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-retailers-new-warehouses-heat-up-local-job-markets-1491739203"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 with a tight labor market }}}\uc2 , has companies looking for such tools in warehouses, where armies of human workers {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-robot-can-be-a-warehouse-workers-best-friend-1501752600"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pick, pack and ship e-commerce orders }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Robots have long been used to perform repetitive tasks in factories and many warehouses. But teaching machines to pick up the wide range of products at fulfillment centers can be complicated and costly. Some companies are using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-leap-for-robots-picking-out-and-boxing-your-online-order-1500807601"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 to speed up the learning curve for robots }}}\uc2  tasked with grasping everything from baby wipes and miniature shampoo bottles to sunglasses and plastic-bagged apparel.\par \par \uc2 Soft Robotics's technology combines automation and vision-guided software with a gripper made of a soft polymer that molds itself around an object like an octopus tentacle. The spongy fingers can pick up an item without having to determine its weight or center of gravity, and without {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/robots-are-learning-to-handle-with-care-1520820240"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 damaging fragile objects like tomatoes }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It's a pliable grasp," Soft Robotics Chief Executive \uc2 Carl Vause\uc2  said. "All the force distribution is done by the materials." The grips allow robots to adapt better than those that use suction cups or rigid metal grippers to pick up objects, he said.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2013, the company has 32 employees and expects to add around 20 more by the end of the year. It has more than 100 customers, Mr. Vause said, including a large retail pizza company and Just Born Quality Confections, maker of Peeps marshmallow treats.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vause declined to say how much annual revenue Soft Robotics generates, but said it was less than $10 million. Revenue grew last year more than 80% from the year before, according to the company.\par \par \uc2 The $20 million funding round, led by Hyperplane Venture Capital, will help Soft Robotics push into the retail and logistics market and expand in the food and beverage sector. The round, the company's second, includes new investors \uc2 Scale Venture Partners\uc2  and the venture capital arm of \uc2 Honeywell International Inc\uc2  ., as well as existing investors including \uc2 ABB Technology Ventures\uc2  , a unit of Swiss engineering and automation firm \uc2 ABB Ltd\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Soft Robotics is rolling out a new retail and logistics application called SuperPick that uses a mix of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and human guidance to teach its robots to pick up a range of differently-sized objects. If the robot's grasp fails, it can ask a remote operator for help, speeding up the learning process.\par \par \uc2 Other companies have used that approach, including Kindred, a manufacturer of robotic sorters that has offices in San Francisco and Toronto.\par \par \uc2 The technology is "a very elegant fusion of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and materials science," said Vivjan Myrto, a partner and founder at Hyperplane. "We think that gives it an advantage over pure \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Write to Jennifer Smith at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jennifer.smith@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jennifer.smith@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20180502ee520008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Tokens sales have been used to raise billions of dollars for startups, often without expensive middlemen such as underwriters and accountants.\par \par \uc2 Yet an unresolved question hangs over the industry\u8212\'20\'14are the tokens in many cases actually just securities, requiring compliance with elaborate investor-protection laws?\par \par \uc2 The answer depends on the token, but the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  last week opened the door to exempting some deals. Those are ones where the token is truly a consumer product that gives its bearer access to a blockchain-based platform or application, rather than an investment that can be traded for a profit.\par \par \uc2 The industry calls these "utility tokens," a term intended to imply they have a use other than speculation. Some lawmakers are pressing the SEC to accept the concept. Last week, at a hearing of a subpanel of the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2 , several Republican members asked a senior SEC official if the regulator could eventually exempt utility tokens.\par \par \uc2 William Hinman allowed that "we certainly can imagine a token where the holder is buying it for its utility and not as an investment."\par \par \uc2 That may be encouraging to developers building applications that take advantage of the blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin and other virtual currencies. But action likely isn't imminent. The SEC is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-launches-cryptocurrency-probe-1519856266"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sorting its way through hundreds of token sales }}}\uc2  that may have violated the securities laws. More important to keep in mind: any carve-out for "utility tokens" might impose conditions that make the coins less appealing to investors.\par \par \uc2 Some possible conditions include: putting limits on the number of tokens any single person can buy, to show the individual intends to use, not resell, them; restricting any token resales for a period of six months or longer; and fixing the supply of available tokens. (These are in addition to some basic elements required to make the case that an asset isn't a security, including offering no equity or voting rights to purchasers, and not marketing the token as an investment that will rise in value as the issuer builds its business.)\par \par \uc2 The SEC's crackdown on ICOs has given some tokens a bad name, and as last week's hearing showed, the lobbying is just getting started. Major venture capitalists like \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14who have investments in the token economy\u8212\'20\'14have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-firms-investors-seek-exemption-from-sec-oversight-1524130200"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sought a safe harbor for utility tokens }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Lobbying will help amplify the industry's argument that regulators have been too restrictive on this new technology. Utility tokens won't get a free pass right away, but there's a chance for a narrow exemption that meets a specific set of criteria.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2 -Backed Venture to Help Big Investors Bet on Bitcoin\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-backed-venture-to-help-big-investors-bet-on-bitcoin-1525176121"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Billionaire Peter Thiel's venture-capital firm }}}\uc2  is backing a startup that aims to bring Wall Street electronic-trading expertise to the bitcoin market\u8212\'20\'14a bet that cryptocurrencies will continue to gain mainstream popularity.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Thiel's firm, \uc2 Founders Fund\uc2 , is among the investors in the early-stage startup, called Tagomi Systems Inc., people familiar with the situation said.\par \par \uc2 Tagomi expects to be the bitcoin version of a broker-dealer, executing orders to buy or sell cryptocurrencies on behalf of wealthy individuals and family offices, according to people with knowledge of the firm's plans. Its co-founders include Greg Tusar, the former head of electronic trading at \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., these people said.\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  to Pay $110 Million to Settle Forex Case\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-to-pay-110-million-to-settle-forex-case-1525200512"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will pay }}}\uc2  roughly $110 million to settle claims that it failed to supervise foreign-exchange traders who put clients at a disadvantage by inappropriately sharing information about their market positions with rivals.\par \par \uc2 The firm will make payments of $54.75 million to both the Federal Reserve and the \uc2 New York Department of Financial Services\uc2 , the regulators said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Between 2008 and early 2013, the bank's traders used electronic chat rooms to share confidential customer information and to discuss potentially coordinating trading activity, the New York agency said.\par \par \uc2 Banks Forced Into Qatar-Saudi Feud\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-forced-into-qatar-saudi-feud-1525253401?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bankers have tried to stay neutral }}}\uc2  in the diplomatic fight between Qatar and its neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Now, they are being forced to choose sides.\par \par \uc2 In early April, \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and \uc2 HSBC\uc2  executives informally told Qatar officials that their banks couldn't work on the emirate's upcoming bond issuance, according to two people familiar with the matter. The reason: It could jeopardize their relationship with the Saudi Arabian government, which was arranging its own bond sale, the people said.\par \par \uc2 In turn, Qatar has refused to do business with some bankers and consultants in Dubai, the U.A.E.'s largest city and the region's financial hub, forcing some Western institutions to do business with Doha through their London offices, bankers say. \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , one of the most active banks in the region, relocated Ghali Laraki, an executive director focusing on Qatari clients, to London, say two people familiar with the matter. Mr. Laraki didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Swiss 1MDB Investigation Turns to PetroSaudi Officials\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/swiss-1mdb-investigation-turns-to-petrosaudi-officials-1525162250"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Swiss prosecutors have launched }}}\uc2  criminal proceedings against two officials at PetroSaudi International Ltd. related to alleged dealings with Malaysian state investment fund \uc2 1Malaysia Development Bhd\uc2 , an escalation of the Swiss probe that started nearly three years ago.\par \par \uc2 1MDB is the subject of investigations in the U.S., Switzerland and other countries into allegations that billions of dollars were siphoned out of the fund, which was set up by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009.\par \par \uc2 The Swiss attorney general's office said they launched the proceedings last November against the PetroSaudi officials, who weren't named, on suspicion of criminal mismanagement, fraud, bribery of foreign public officials, aggravated money laundering and misconduct in public office. One of the officials also is suspected of document forgery.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Bank of Canada Governor Warns on High Household Debt\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-canada-governor-warns-on-high-household-debt-1525200577"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Canadians racked up high levels }}}\uc2  of household debt while interest rates were low and house prices were rising, a natural consequence of prolonged stimulus that today poses risks to the economy, Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Canadians owe an average of 170% of their disposable income, up sharply from 20 years ago and largely concentrated in mortgage debt, Mr. Poloz said during a speech at the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce in the Northwest Territories. About 8% of borrowers owe 350% or more of their gross income, he said, representing one-fifth of overall household debt.\par \par \uc2 Barclays Looks Outside for New Chairman\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/barclays-looks-outside-for-new-chairman-1525172090"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Barclays PLC will look externally }}}\uc2  for a new chairman after front-runner \uc2 Gerry Grimstone\uc2  unexpectedly pulled out of the race to head the British bank.\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2 's current chairman, \uc2 John McFarlane\uc2 , said Tuesday that he had asked the board to search for his replacement. Mr. McFarlane hasn't said when he will go and pledged to serve at least one more year at the British bank. "While some might wish so, you are not getting rid of me yet," said Mr. McFarlane at the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grimstone, who is the chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen PLC and chairs the international banking unit at \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , was tipped by insiders to take over the reins. Mr. Grimstone however has decided not to apply for the job, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 MetLife Finance Chief Steps Down\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/metlife-finance-chief-steps-down-1525181540"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 MetLife Inc.'s chief financial officer }}}\uc2  has stepped down from the post, days after the company announced reduced compensation tied to weaknesses in internal financial controls.\par \par \uc2 John C. R. Hele is being replaced immediately but will stay until September. Mr. Hele received 6.4% less in total compensation in 2017 than the year before, including a 25% reduction in the cash portion of his incentive pay.\par \par \uc2 The decline in his pay came in the wake of a problem in the company's retirement-services business that failed to pay thousands of people owed pension benefits.\par \par \uc2 Regional Bank Deposits Drop\par \par \uc2 Welcome to the new world of Main Street banking, where {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-biggest-banks-are-gobbling-up-deposits-heres-whos-not-1524999612"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 deposits are starting to head out the door }}}\uc2  after years of growth. This month, major regional banks reported the increasing competition for deposits in their first-quarter earnings. Some lenders, including Dallas's \uc2 Comerica Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Regions Financial Corp\uc2 . of Birmingham, Ala., lost deposits compared with a year ago. Others are still adding deposits, but at a much slower pace than recent years.\par \par \uc2 In 2017, 10 of 22 major regional banks experienced declining U.S. deposits, compared with only two the year before, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . data. The smallest U.S. banks, which tend to be community lenders with a handful of branches, have also seen deposits decline, according to an analysis by investment bank FIG Partners. The three biggest banks added a combined $118 billion in U.S. deposits last year. As a group, the nearly two dozen regional banks added a net amount of roughly $55 billion.\par \par \uc2 Deposits are the lifeblood of banks and a key factor in profitability. Banks use deposits to make loans, so when they pay higher deposit rates, they make less money. When a bank loses too many deposits, it could be forced to rein in lending or pursue more expensive funding.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday, May 2\par \par \uc2 2 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.law.temple.edu/news/sec-chair-jay-clayton-to-discuss-evolving-markets-during-temple-address/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 speaks at Temple University }}}\uc2  in Philadelphia about the market for retail investment advice.\par \par \uc2 4:45 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  member \uc2 Brian Quintenz\uc2  speaks at the \uc2 Futures Industry Association\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://lc2018.fia.org/program/2526"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 law and compliance division conference }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Thursday, May 3\par \par \uc2 NA\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  holds its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/events/2018-cfpb-research-conference/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 annual research conference }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 8:15 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  member Russ Behnam speak at the speaks to the \uc2 Futures Industry Association\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://lc2018.fia.org/program/2526"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 law and compliance division conference }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 8:30 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission Chief Accountant Wesley Bricker and Financial Accounting Standards Board Chairman Russell Golden give opening remarks at the Robert Zicklin Center for Corporate Integrity's annual {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/event/the-17th-annual-financial-reporting-conference/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 financial reporting conference }}}\uc2 . Bricker and other SEC officials will follow with a panel discussion on the latest regulatory concerns.\par \par \uc2 Online Consumer Data Could Supplement Credit Reports\par \par \uc2 The digital information that consumers drop around the internet can be collected and be used by lenders to determine borrowers' creditworthiness, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nber.org/papers/w24551"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a working paper }}}\uc2  by Tobias Berg and Ana Gombovi\u263\'01\'07 of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Valentin Burg of Humboldt University Berlin and Manju Puri of \uc2 Duke University\uc2 . Using data from a German e-commerce company and a private credit bureau that compiles a score similar to the FICO score, the researchers found "even the simple, easily accessible variables from the digital footprint proxy for income, character and reputation and are highly valuable for default prediction." They write, "The correlation between the score based on the digital footprint variables and the FICO score is approximately 10%. ... This suggests that the digital footprint complements rather than substitutes for credit bureau information and a lender that uses information from both sources (FICO + digital footprint) can make superior lending decisions compared to lenders that only access one of the two sources of information."\par \par \uc2 The Long and Short of Dodd-Frank\par \par \uc2 Higher bank capital requirements under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law have constrained bank lending to some extent, but eliminating the law "appears to be too great a risk" in the long run, Tony Hughes of Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  writes in an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/take-the-long-view-in-assessing-dodd-frank"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 American Banker opinion piece }}}\uc2 . Policy makers ultimately have two choices for economic growth: deregulate to allow "faster growth during shorter expansions and larger contractions during more frequent recessions" or keep Dodd-Frank and "have weaker sustained growth and a lower probability of deep recession," he says. Research "suggests that the crippling of credit that occurs in [a] recession is usually so great that, through the economic cycle, bank lending is actually higher with a stronger capital cushion," he writes.\par \par \uc2 Mulvaney Should Drop CFPB Suit Against Navient\par \par \uc2 Mick Mulvaney is "cleaning up after \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2  at the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 ," {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cleaning-up-after-richard-cordray-1525216332"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 writes The Wall Street Journal's editorial board }}}\uc2 . As part of his overhauls, he should look into the CFPB's "dubious lawsuit" against student-loan servicer \uc2 Navient Corp\uc2 ., the board writes. The CFPB has used consumer entries from its complaints database to bolster its claims that Navient failed borrowers, "But the Navient depositions show that many of the complaints are unreliable and serve no other purpose than to give grist to trial lawyers and tarnish the reputation of law-abiding businesses," according to the editorial.
