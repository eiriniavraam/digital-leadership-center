All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Venture capitalists are hoping a little action this fall will improve what has been a dismal year for initial public offerings in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The first half of 2016 saw the fewest IPOs by venture-backed companies since 2009. As of Sept. 11, there were 22 IPOs, all but four of them by health-care companies. Many of the health-care offerings needed an assist from their venture backers.\par \par \uc2 See also\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/health-care-ipos-get-boost-from-venture-capital-investors-1475154543"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Health-Care IPOs Get Boost From Venture-Capital Investors}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/pro/venturecapital/graphics/ipo-index/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Measuring IPO Performance}}}\par \par \uc2 Uncertain public markets and falling valuations of venture-backed companies have discouraged technology companies from taking the plunge this year, but the outlook improved during the summer. Newly public companies have generally performed well. The WSJ Pro Venture-Backed Post-IPO Index, which measures company performance for two years after an IPO, had risen for the half from a low of 672.94 in February to 996.64 as of Sept. 12.\par \par \uc2 There are plenty of candidates if the market looks favorable. As of mid-September, there were 92 U.S.-based companies on The Wall Street Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club, a compilation of venture-backed companies valued at $1 billion or more.\par \par \uc2 Companies are starting to queue up. \uc2 Focus Financial Partners\uc2 , for instance, filed confidentially for its IPO and might seek to list by the end of the year, The Journal previously reported. Backed by \uc2 Centerbridge Partners\uc2 , Polaris Partners and Summit Partners, the company helps wealth managers set up and expand their businesses.\par \par \uc2 There were 26 companies in public registration for an IPO as of Sept. 11, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by Private Equity Analyst publisher Dow Jones & Co., and there are surely many more that have filed confidentially under the federal Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. This enables them to have their prospective IPO filing reviewed by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  and to test the waters with qualified potential investors. Once they file publicly, such companies should be in a position to launch an IPO within a few weeks.\par \par \uc2 Here is a rundown of some companies that are strong prospects to stage an IPO in the next six months.\par \par \uc2 MapR Technologies Inc\uc2 .\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  software companies are emerging as potential IPO candidates, despite falling valuations in this area. \uc2 MapR Technologies Inc\uc2 . founder \uc2 John Schroeder\uc2 , for instance, said his company is chasing profitability and could be ready for an IPO in early 2017.\par \par \uc2 MapR, of San Jose, Calif., was supposed to be cash-flow positive by the end of 2015, according to Private Equity Analyst records, but that goal was delayed. In September, Mr. Schroeder stepped down as chief executive in favor of Matt Mills, a former sales executive from Oracle Corp. MapR combines the advantages of free open-source software like Hadoop, which was developed by and for computer scientists and is hard to use, with proprietary software that makes it easier.\par \par \uc2 The company is now valued at about $500 million, according to data provider \uc2 PitchBook Data Inc\uc2 ., more than its competitor \uc2 Hortonworks Inc\uc2 ., which was valued at more than $1 billion when it went public in late 2014.\par \par \uc2 Another competitor, \uc2 Cloudera Inc\uc2 ., raised $670 million from \uc2 Intel Capital\uc2  and other investors and was last valued in March 2014 at $4.1 billion. Although that valuation likely has fallen, \uc2 Cloudera\uc2 's share price has been picking up again this year, according to The Journal's Startup Stock Tracker, raising hopes that it could go public despite its high valuation.\par \par \uc2 TechStyle Fashion Group\par \par \uc2 TechStyle Fashion Group\uc2 , the company behind fashion brands such as \uc2 JustFab\uc2  and \uc2 ShoeDazzle\uc2 , has been getting more serious. It renamed itself from the more carefree \uc2 Just Fabulous Inc\uc2 . It also brought in a chief financial officer with IPO experience this summer. \uc2 Todd Tappin\uc2  previously was CFO at advertising technology company \uc2 Rubicon Project Inc\uc2 ., while the company completed an IPO in 2014.\par \par \uc2 TechStyle's business model uses monthly memberships to create more predictable revenue streams. On one of its Web properties, \uc2 JustFab.com\uc2 , a women's fashion site, members are charged $39.95 each month, which can be used as credit to make purchases or to save. Another unusual aspect of TechStyle is that it uses a personalized quiz that shoppers take when they sign up. This helps the company personalize offerings, which it says increases the likelihood of purchases.\par \par \uc2 TechStyle says it has more than 4 million members and has shipped about 50 million products. The company has been expanding its product lines to include children's and men's fashions. It also has physical locations at stores called Fabletics. The company opened its 15th Fabletics store in September.\par \par \uc2 The El Segundo, Calif.-based company was valued at $1 billion in a 2014 funding round. It has raised $279 million to date. Among its investors are Matrix Partners and Technology Crossover Ventures.\par \par \uc2 AppNexus Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The ad-tech industry may be pinning its hopes on one long-awaited IPO. \uc2 AppNexus Inc\uc2 ., a platform that enables buyers and sellers to auction off advertising space according to purchasing algorithms, may be waiting in the wings. Industry publication AdExchanger reported the company is working to file for a public offering. The New York startup, valued at $1.8 billion, has raised more than $250 million from investors including \uc2 First Round Capital\uc2 , Khosla Ventures and British advertising firm \uc2 WPP PLC\uc2 . It claims profitability and a series of acquisitions.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the New York company made very public moves to eliminate ad fraud from its supply pool. The company claims the crackdown has boosted its ad prices, allowing it to power the same amount of ad spending despite a dip in volume.\par \par \uc2 Other ad-tech companies such as \uc2 Rocket Fuel Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Criteo SA\uc2  have struggled after going public. As ad blockers have grown in popularity in recent years, public and private investors alike have grown skeptical of the category. But the opportunity for ad-tech public offerings may have reopened in September, when ad-buying platform \uc2 Trade Desk Inc\uc2 . listed on the \uc2 Nasdaq Stock Market\uc2  and saw its stock jump by more than 60% on its first day of trading to a closing price of $30.10 per share, from an initial price of $18 per share.\par \par \uc2 Okta Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Okta Inc\uc2 ., a member of the Billion Dollar Startup Club, has signaled it is considering an IPO through a job listing for an assistant controller on its website. In the description for the position, the San Francisco startup called for a candidate who can help the company maintain a staff that can "support our pre- and post-IPO financial reporting environment." Okta declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Okta last announced financing a year ago, when it raised an additional $75 million, valuing the company at $1.2 billion. Its investors include \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital. The company produces an identity management tool that enables employees to access enterprise applications on any device.\par \par \uc2 Dropbox Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Dropbox Inc\uc2 ., a prominent private company that has raised more than $1 billion in funding, was valued at $10 billion in 2014. But since then, investors including \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . have cut their estimates of the company's valuation.\par \par \uc2 That high $10 billion valuation may pose a problem to \uc2 Dropbox\uc2  if it seeks an IPO because the company and its investors may not want to go public until its valuation is above\u8212\'20\'14or at least close to\u8212\'20\'14its last private valuation. Competitor Box Inc., meanwhile, went public in early 2015 and has a market capitalization of $1.88 billion. It reported a loss of $38.1 million on $95.7 million in revenue for its most recent quarter. Box focuses on enterprise customers. \uc2 Dropbox\uc2  has more than 500 million users but most don't pay. That provides a pool of potential sales leads, but Wall Street will want to see how many of them are converting to paid customers.\par \par \uc2 The San Francisco company has been focusing on business customers and says it has 150,000 businesses that pay for its service. \uc2 Dropbox\uc2  in June announced a partnership with \uc2 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co\uc2 . aimed at gaining more such corporate customers.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160929ec9t005h9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

True is typically the first institutional investor in a startup and seeks to invest 70% to 100% of a round with $1 million to $3 million. The firm seeks larger positions than some smaller seed firms. True can also invest earlier than some larger traditional venture firms and then follow on in subsequent rounds, maintaining a large position. The firm has moved aggressively into new categories, hoping to plant its flag before other investors. Recently it has been active in startups combining biology and health care, such as genetics startup Deep Genomics, synthetic biology startup Zymergen Inc., mental health startup Ginger.io Inc. and personalized health firm Vital Labs. True has also been active in neuroscience, where it has invested in four startups.\par \par \uc2 Westly Group\uc2 , Menlo Park, Calif.\par \par \uc2 Westly Group\uc2  is seeking $150 million for its third fund, according to a filing with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .

The amounts raised for the fund and for co-investments are both higher than the French firm's \u8364\'20\'AC2.4 billion previous fund, which closed in 2013, and its accompanying \u8364\'20\'AC400 million co-investment pool. More than two-thirds of investors in Ardian's LBO Fund V committed to the firm's latest fund. It also attracted 20 new investors to its latest vehicle, including institutional investors and sovereign-wealth funds, said Philippe Poletti, who heads the firm's midcap buyout practice. Ardian's latest buyout fund will invest in companies with enterprise values of \u8364\'20\'AC200 million to \u8364\'20\'AC600 million in sectors such as health care, chemicals, aeronautics and defense, insurance and food ingredients, Mr. Poletti said.\par \par \uc2 Blue Water Energy, London\par \par \uc2 Blue Water Energy, a firm that invests solely in the energy sector, recently held a $885 million first close of its latest fund, said a person familiar with the matter. The firm, which aims to raise $1 billion in total, plans to close the fund by the end of the year, the person said. Blue Water's $861 million debut vehicle, raised in 2013, is now about 80% invested with room for one or two more investments, the person said. The firm seeks to invest $150 per company and follows a buy-and-build strategy of providing initial capital followed by add-on acquisitions and growth capital.\par \par \uc2 CBPE Capital\uc2 , London\par \par \uc2 CBPE Capital\uc2  held a \u163\'00\'A3459 million ($613 million) final close on its latest buyout vehicle, CBPE Capital Fund IX.

The vehicle is almost double the size of the firm's fifth vehicle, which collected \u163\'00\'A3360 million in 2012. Wol Kolade, the firm's managing partner, said the firm began fundraising for the pool in May and saw a significant share of returning investors, with a "good 80%" of investors in previous funds "reupping" their commitments, combined with new interest from "a number of large, first-time U.S. investors [and] pension funds." Mr. Kolade said appetite from foreign investors accounted for 90% of the fund's investor base. The vehicle will invest in U.K.-based companies with enterprise values of \u163\'00\'A320 million to \u163\'00\'A375 million within a range of sectors including health care, telecommunications, education and business, and financial services.\par \par \uc2 TDR Capital\uc2 , London\par \par \uc2 TDR Capital\uc2  started marketing its fourth buyout fund, for which it is aiming to raise \u8364\'20\'AC2.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

The vehicle will invest in the European market for secondhand and private-equity fund stakes and typically target transactions of up to \u8364\'20\'AC50 million. The vehicle is expected to be larger than Idinvest's previous secondary fund, a \u8364\'20\'AC228 million vehicle raised in 2014. Mr. Simon said almost all investors in Idinvest's prior secondary fund re-upped with the firm. The fund, which tends not to use debt for its transactions and doesn't use fund leverage, will target returns of 1.6 times and 1.8 times on a net basis, he said. Idinvest agreed to the fund's first deal, which will represent about 15% of the fund size, he added.\par \par \uc2 VENTURE CAPITAL\par \par \uc2 Earlybird Venture Capital\uc2 , Berlin\par \par \uc2 Earlybird Venture Capital\uc2  held a first closing of an undisclosed amount for its Earlybird Health Tech Fund.

The city state's regulator admitted in July that the scandal had dented Singapore's reputation as a trusted financial centre, and pledged more "intrusive" inspections of banks .\par \par \uc2 Authorities have found lapses at a number of banks in Singapore that acted as conduits for flows of funds from 1MDB.\par \par \uc2 Singapore authorities said in response to yesterday's report that they intended to develop more sophisticated data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  as part of a broader push to strengthen policing of financial crime.\par \par \uc2 The task force, based in Paris, also warned that the majority of Singapore's dealers in precious stones and metals are not covered by anti-money laundering supervision. "In contrast with the financial sector, the financial penalty structure . . . is quite diverse and enforcement of the sanctioning regime for non-compliance . . . is at an early stage," the report said.\par \par \uc2 The report says Singapore's transparency measures are insufficient to ensure information on beneficial owners - the people who ultimately own and control companies - is available "in a timely manner". Singapore should be more alert to the terrorist financing risks "associated with its geographical location and its position as a financial hub", it suggests.\par \par \uc2 Since the review, six Bangladeshi men have been jailed in Singapore on terrorist financing charges, on suspicion of planning attacks in their home country.\par \par \uc2 Malaysia's government has been rocked by allegations that about $4bn has been misappropriated from state companies, following investigations by regulators into 1MDB. Flows of money linked to the fund are under investigation in at least six countries.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160928ec9s0001v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Malaysia's second-largest pension fund bought into ride-sharing service \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . last week, in a deal that marked a continuing shift in local funds' investment strategies. It was also the fund's first direct investment in a foreign company, reports Nikkei staff writer Ching Yee Choo.\par \par \uc2 Fresh from the annual Malaysian Private Equity Forum last week where it played host, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan, a $30 billion pension fund, spent $30 million on the deal, according to Reuters, quoting sources. \uc2 Uber Technologies\uc2  declined to comment on the sum.\par \par \uc2 The fund's latest investment signals a changing trend in local funds' allocation to include more alternative asset classes such as private equity. Currently, its investment allocation is at a ratio of 9:1, with the bulk invested in traditional asset classes such as fixed income and equities.\par \par \uc2 Other notable investments from local funds into alternative asset classes are \uc2 Khazanah Nasional Berhad\uc2 's investments in mobile entertainment provider Garena Interactive Holding Ltd. and augmented reality search engine Blippar Inc., as well as mobile lending and credit \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  platform company WeLab Holdings. Khazanah is the Malaysian government's investment arm.\par \par \uc2 As one of those affected by the foreign exchange volatility, KWAP announced that it would be making changes in its asset allocation in favor of alternative asset classes such as private equity. Its alternative asset-class investments consist of real estate at 7%, private equity at 2% and infrastructure at 1%.\par \par \uc2 KWAP also wants to participate in the technology and logistics sectors. This is in line with its intention to tweak its asset allocation in a "lower for longer investment climate," which affected its return on investment, a measure of the amount returned relative to investment costs.\par \par \uc2 According to its annual report, KWAP's ROI had been increasing year-over-year from 2011 onward but fell in 2014. In 2015, it fell short of its target ROI of 6%, achieving 5.4% ROI instead. It expected to post a 5% ROI this year.\par \par \uc2 The slowdown in global economic growth has affected deal making in the private-equity sector, with the number of transactions tapering in the past two years within Southeast Asia. But not all hope is lost, according to panelists from MPEF.\par \par \uc2 The global private-equity capital raised in 2015 at $527 billion was lower than the $555 billion recorded the previous year, according to \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 .'s "Global Private Equity Report 2016." Recent data from alternative assets industry intelligence firm Preqin reveals that only fairly recently the global private-equity fundraising activities picked up, bringing the total funds raised to date to $182 billion, compared with $137 billion in the previous corresponding period.\par \par \uc2 In a global environment of lackluster growth stemming from low interest rates, high volatility and valuations, the forum shed light on private equity as an under tapped investment class that yields better returns than public equities.\par \par \uc2 On the venture-capital front, concerns abound that Malaysia and the Southeast Asia region is playing catch-up to the aggressively expansionary China.\par \par \uc2 Private-equity firms admit it is a tough market. Some said they look for the most interesting opportunities with an international angle, while others spoke of "permanently warm areas." The latter were described as a decadeslong trend that continues because of "natural tailwinds" in the industry, owing to the demographics and socioeconomics of a particular country or region.\par \par \uc2 For venture-capital firms, concerns were raised about the relatively slower pace of deals inked between local or regional venture-capital firms. "If Malaysia cannot provide for [startups], they will go out of the [country] to find [funds]," said 500 Startups Managing Partner Ng Khailee. They cited Malaysia's ride-sharing app firm Grab, which initially received local funding but last week clinched $750 million from a series F round led by Japan's \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2 . Overall, venture-capital firms believe that the future is in financial technology, with consumers as drivers of growth.\par \par \uc2 The private-equity funds raised in Southeast Asia total about $5.7 billion, while the rest of Asia saw a total of $60 billion to date, according to the Asian Venture Capital Journal.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160928ec9s0086h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Two Sigma Investments\uc2  LP spent the past 15 years honing its quantitative approach to investing. Now, it is turning its number-crunching prowess on new prey: insurance.\par \par \uc2 The firm is joining with \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 . and Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd. to provide an automated, online analytical system to issue policies in minutes to smaller businesses like clothing shops, beauty parlors and medical offices.\par \par \uc2 Under the arrangement, agents will go online and type in the barest of information about their client -- business name and address and a few other details -- and algorithms will begin filling in information about the prospective policyholder. That is in contrast to longstanding practices in which insurers often ask dozens of questions for the process to get started.\par \par \uc2 For Two Sigma, it is the first significant attempt to branch out to a new business from investing. The firm is known as one of the most successful "quants," which are quantitative hedge funds that use computer systems to trawl data, make predictions and trade automatically in the markets.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2001 by a computer scientist, \uc2 David Siegel\uc2 , and a mathematician, \uc2 John Overdeck\uc2 , who had both worked in hedge funds in the past, it increasingly is casting itself as the \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . of Wall Street, a technology company that can take its data-crunching skills to work on a variety of finance and economics problems.\par \par \uc2 Last October, it hired Alfred Spector, Google's former vice president of research and special initiatives, to become its chief technology officer.\par \par \uc2 Two Sigma thinks of itself as a company that focuses on "problems involving risk and economic activity," rather than as a hedge fund, Mr. Siegel said. The insurance deal is its first major effort outside of the markets, but he said over time it plans to target other opportunities where it can use those skills.\par \par \uc2 Small and medium-size business insurance is a "gigantic market" and a "data science" problem, he said.\par \par \uc2 "It's not just about taking manual processes and automating them," Mr. Siegel said. "By using our data science, we think we can do a better job of underwriting."\par \par \uc2 The algorithms being used by the Two Sigma group's venture, called Attune, will draw on detail that Two Sigma has obtained from vendors who collect public records and other sources that can tell \uc2 AIG\uc2  and Hamilton what they believe they need to know to understand the risk to be insured.\par \par \uc2 That could include detail about square footage and construction features of the business premises, changes to mechanical systems over the years as outlined in government building permits, proximity to fire hydrants and sources of flooding, as well as code violations, other regulatory run-ins and legal entanglements, the firms said.\par \par \uc2 In most instances, the algorithms would be expected to assess the risk and determine a policy's price almost instantaneously.\par \par \uc2 The effort to speed up the issuance of policies isn't the first. In February, \uc2 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc\uc2 . launched the online coveryourbusiness.com, where business owners can go directly to obtain policies.\par \par \uc2 "Every person is buying more and more online, even paper towels, so why not insurance?"said Rakesh Gupta, the Berkshire initiative's chief operating officer. Believing simplicity for the applicant is key, the Berkshire team is continuing to whittle down the number of questions traditionally asked by "questioning all the questions."\par \par \uc2 AIG Chief Executive \uc2 Peter Hancock\uc2  said he was attracted to the partnership by Two Sigma's data-analysis record. They have been "learning the hard lessons of what \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  can and can't do," he said.\par \par \uc2 AIG\uc2  is well-known for covering complex risks at big companies. While it hasn't focused on basic property and liability policies for small enterprises, it does provide them workers-compensation insurance and specialized coverage to protect against such things as cyberrisk.\par \par \uc2 Bermuda-based Hamilton was established in late 2013 by a group of investors, led by insurance-industry veteran \uc2 Brian Duperreault\uc2  and including principals of Two Sigma.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160928000123"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160928ec9s0008y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Rocked by the fall in oil-and-gas prices, some energy-focused private-equity funds are pleading with their investors for more time and money.\par \par \uc2 EnerVest Ltd\uc2 ., a Houston-based investment firm that says it operates more U.S. oil-and-gas wells than any other company, is asking investors in two of its funds to put up hundreds of millions of dollars to bolster the troubled vehicles or risk losing the billions they have already invested. "No question, this is a giant disappointment," Chief Executive \uc2 John Walker\uc2  said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 First Reserve Corp\uc2 ., meanwhile, is negotiating with investors to extend the life of a $7.8 billion fund from 2006 to give it time for oil prices to rebound, according to pension records and people familiar with the matter. The fund has lost more than a third of its original value, and \uc2 First Reserve\uc2  has proposed waiving management fees it charges investors in exchange for more time to sell the fund's remaining holdings, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Private-equity firms were among the most avid financiers in the shale-drilling boom of the last decade, which helped produce market-flooding supplies of oil and gas. Two years ago, oil prices collapsed, and they have languished at about $45 a barrel. The decline has vexed investors across Wall Street who financed the shale boom with $100-a-barrel oil in mind.\par \par \uc2 The woes of private-equity energy funds are rippling to pensions and other institutional investors that pumped more than $400 billion into these pools since shale drilling took off. While prices could eventually rebound, bringing investments back to profitability, some private-equity funds don't have time to wait.\par \par \uc2 Funds raised a decade ago are proving particularly painful for investors. Funds typically have a limited lifespan, promising to sell their assets and return investors' money after 10 years. Many are filled with assets worth less than they cost and face the prospect of liquidating at losses. The alternatives are for investment firms to negotiate deals with their investors to extend the fund or bring in outside investors with fresh cash.\par \par \uc2 "There are no good options when an energy fund reaches the end of its life at the bottom of the cycle," said Jay Yoder, head of real assets at Pavilion Alternatives Group, a Sacramento, Calif., firm that advises private-equity investors. "The number of energy funds that need more time is at a level we've not seen before."\par \par \uc2 The price slump has left old funds reluctant to unload assets. At year-end, private-equity funds specializing in oil and gas that were raised between 2005 and 2007 held assets valued at $34.5 billion, or about half the $71.1 billion that those 131 funds started out with, according to data provider Preqin.\par \par \uc2 EnerVest built a network of 40,000 wells by pairing its investors' cash with borrowed money. Now, EnerVest's lenders, led by \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., are forcing it to repay a big chunk of the money borrowed by two funds because the oil-and-gas reserves used as collateral lost much of their value when energy prices collapsed. That has put the funds at risk of default.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Walker said he and other EnerVest executives put $90 million of their own toward repaying lenders, and some of the firm's investors have committed $250 million. But about $150 million is still needed.\par \par \uc2 EnerVest, which said it eliminated management fees on the older of the two funds and halved them for the other, is asking investors to contribute roughly 10%-12% of their original investments in the $1.5 billion and $2 billion funds.\par \par \uc2 "We have some limited partners that are mad as hell at us," said Mr. Walker, referring to the funds' investors. "We've had some chew us out and hang up on us."\par \par \uc2 In 2013, EnerVest borrowed $1.4 billion for its 13th fund. Mr. Walker said EnerVest paid back much of that debt, but the fund was still leveraged when oil prices plummeted in late 2014.\par \par \uc2 "We thought we were underleveraged," said Mr. Walker, a former Wall Street analyst who founded the firm in 1992. EnerVest's funds have typically returned more than 30%, and the firm raised $2.4 billion in November for its 14th and largest-ever fund.\par \par \uc2 But investors in its 2010 and 2013 funds, such as Orange County Employees Retirement System, face potentially large losses. Ocers records show that at year-end, $54 million of investments in those funds had been written down to $9.7 million.\par \par \uc2 "There is not a practical way for Ocers to exit its investments without taking a material pricing haircut," the pension's investment chief wrote to its board. "We will most likely ride out this horse."\par \par \uc2 That is what \uc2 First Reserve\uc2  is asking investors to do after a plan to restructure its troubled fund by moving assets into a new fund fizzled when too few investors agreed to sell their stakes.\par \par \uc2 First Reserve\uc2  invested more than half its $7.8 billion fund in the run-up to more than $140-a-barrel oil in 2008, according to private-markets \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm Bison. Since then, the fund has lost roughly 35% of investors' cash, or about $2.7 billion, through June 30, according to public pension data.\par \par \uc2 Now, the Greenwich, Conn., firm is trying to extend the fund's life.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, \uc2 California Public Employees' Retirement System\uc2  pushed for a break on fees charged by \uc2 First Reserve\uc2  to manage the remaining investments, much of which are shares in an offshore oil explorer and pipeline company that have both lost more than 90% over the last two years.\par \par \uc2 In June, Real Desrochers, \uc2 Calpers\uc2 's head of private-equity investing, wrote First Reserve Chairman and co-CEO \uc2 Bill Macaulay\uc2  and suggested the firm distribute the shares to investors, according to correspondence reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. That would eliminate management fees charged for holding the stock. \uc2 First Reserve\uc2  has reaped more than $500 million in fees since the fund was launched, Mr. Desrochers wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Macaulay responded that \uc2 First Reserve\uc2  has offered ways for investors to sell out of the fund "or remain invested in a fund that will have a sufficient duration to benefit from the recovery in the energy markets." Since then, \uc2 First Reserve\uc2  has told some investors that it would waive management fees if the fund's life is extended, according to people familiar with the discussions.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160928000119"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160928ec9s0008u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications:\par \par \uc2 An aide to Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said he wouldn't object to the coming municipal bond legislation. An earlier version of this story said an aide to Mr. Shelby said he would support the bill. Also, these comments were made by an aide to Sen. Shelby. Due to an editing mistake, an earlier correction to this story erroneously cited Sen. Shelby for these remarks. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A bipartisan group of senators is pushing to include municipal bonds in bank-safety rules, the latest wrinkle in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/washington-battles-over-munis-safe-or-hard-to-sell-1456962547"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 continuing fight  }}}\uc2  over how safe\u8212\'20\'14and salable\u8212\'20\'14the debt of states and localities would be in another financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Sens. Mark Warner (D., Va.), \uc2 Charles Schumer\uc2  (D., N.Y.) and Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) are set to introduce legislation on municipal bonds this week, according to Senate aides. The bill aims to open the door for big U.S. banks to count municipal bonds as liquid assets under rules completed in 2014 that were designed to ensure Wall Street firms have enough cash during a crisis to fund their operations for 30 days.\par \par \uc2 The Senate legislation would place municipal bonds on the lowest rung of the "high quality liquid assets" category. That means they would be treated on par with corporate bonds, but not as favorably as under related legislation approved by the House early this year.\par \par \uc2 "We must ensure a continued and reliable access to capital markets for our local governments," Mr. Warner said in a written statement. "This legislation represents a compromise that achieves that while appropriately balancing concerns for the long term stability of our financial system."\par \par \uc2 The rules, slated to go into effect next year, are aimed at making banks hold more cash or securities that are easy to sell. The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  and two other bank regulators had originally decided debt issued by states and localities didn't make the cut\u8212\'20\'14prompting a backlash from banks, lawmakers and states and localities who warned the move would make the bonds less attractive and raise borrowing costs for municipalities.\par \par \uc2 The Fed completed amendments in April to allow some investment-grade municipal bonds to qualify. But the two other regulators involved in the rules\u8212\'20\'14the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  and the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2  .\u8212\'20\'14haven't followed suit.\par \par \uc2 Aides to Senate lawmakers say their bill was scaled back from the House version to gain broad support for it in the Senate, though it is unclear if there is sufficient time in the remaining year to advance the bill.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Richard Shelby\uc2  (R., Ala.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, indicated earlier this year that he was reluctant to second-guess banking regulators that originally excluded municipal bonds when they wrote the rules in 2014. But an aide to Mr. Shelby said he wouldn't object to the coming bill as it incorporates changes the Fed already adopted in its version of the rules.\par \par \uc2 Banks underwrite muni bonds, buy them as investments and sell them to clients. Lenders have played an increasingly central role in the thinly traded, $3.7 trillion market and are now the biggest buyers of municipal debt, according to Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc., a research firm.\par \par \uc2 Municipal officials have generally applauded the Fed's willingness to make changes to the rules but say legislation is necessary, largely because banking firms typically hold municipal debt in units that are overseen by the other policy makers involved in the rules, particularly the \uc2 OCC\uc2  , which regulates national banks.\par \par \uc2 Officials at the \uc2 OCC\uc2  remain dismissive of including the municipal bonds in the rules and don't believe the debt is sufficiently liquid, according to people familiar with their thinking. The \uc2 FDIC\uc2  is waiting until the rules go into effect next year before considering amending its version, according to people familiar with that agency.\par \par \uc2 While the Senate bill would rank municipal debt similarly to the Fed's amended rules\u8212\'20\'14allowing the banks to count 50% of the bonds' face value when including them in their funding buffers\u8212\'20\'14the legislation would allow banks to include more types of municipal bonds, a Senate aide said.\par \par \uc2 These include revenue bonds, or securities backed by a specific revenue stream, that comprise the bulk of debt issued by states and local governments but that are kept out of the current Fed version of the rules.\par \par \uc2 The House bill, meanwhile, is broader than both the Senate bill and the Fed's version of the rules, allowing banks to count 85% of the bonds' face value.\par \par \uc2 To date, banks have by and large continued to hold lots of municipal bonds despite the rules, in part because they are seen as less risky than corporate debt and are priced competitively to other types of debt, according to bank officials. If interest rates rise this year, banks are expected to begin to pare their muni holdings.\par \par \uc2 Write to Andrew Ackerman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:andrew.ackerman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 andrew.ackerman@wsj.com  }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160927ec9r002s4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

It was both unexpected and unwanted since a handful of exporters such as Toyota, which benefit from a cheap currency, have been a significant source of growth for decades.\par \par \uc2 Then there were also sounds of distress from GPIF, the Japanese pension fund, and Japan Postal Savings. They feared that the prices of financial assets were increasingly artificial thanks to central bank policies. Invest today and lose tomorrow when the stimulus policies cease or reverse.\par \par \uc2 By April, even the head of the Financial Services Agency, Nobuchika Mori, delicately criticised the BoJ action at a speech at the annual ISDA meeting. However, it was only when the chief executive of Mitsubishi UFJ, \uc2 Nobuyuki Hirano\uc2  , joined in the chorus of naysayers and quit the government's primary dealership , that it became clear the BoJ began to take notice. The central bank announced a review of its actions, which culminated in last week's decision not to push interest rates further into negative territory .\par \par \uc2 Across all markets that central banks have been engaged in unconventional monetary policies, there have been many victims in the financial community. They include pension funds, insurers and asset managers, as well as ordinary households hoping to earn something on their savings but that don't have access to the leveraged opportunities of the wealthy. Yet it was not until the banks started feeling the pain that central banks seemed to reconsider.\par \par \uc2 It is interesting, albeit somewhat puzzling, to note banks' clout, which contrasts markedly with that of others in finance. And the muscle of banks persists, despite them mattering less and less.\par \par \uc2 Especially in Japan, banks still depend on the gap between the short-term rates at which they borrow and the long-term rates at which they lend for their profits. The \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2 's latest measures, announced last week, are intended to steepen the yield curve and address banks' anxieties about their after tax profits. That is especially true of Japan's many smaller regional banks - the shares of which foreign fund managers are now shorting.\par \par \uc2 There is a similar dynamic elsewhere. Virtually all those who have been hit by central bank policies have, eight years after the crisis that gave rise to them, been reluctant to point out that they have proved ineffective and costly.\par \par \uc2 One of the few insurers to speak out and destroy the myths has been \uc2 Swiss Re\uc2 . Indeed, 18 months ago it attempted to quantify the costs in foregone income to both US savers and European insurers as a result of the respective central bank policies on both sides of the Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 That is why earnings of US insurers have dropped (well before those of the banks). For example, Metropolitan Life warned in its most recent quarterly results that it needed to bolster its reserves by $2bn largely because of a squeeze from low interest rates. It is also why a recent report from \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  flags the difficulties faced by active fund management firms. "Low growth and low rates weigh on active manager performance, placing significant pressure on fees," the report notes.\par \par \uc2 In the US, one reason insurers are so reluctant to criticise the policies of the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , analysts say, is that the insurance industry currently falls under the purview of local state regulators. "They fear above all else coming under the much more critical eye of a national regulator such as the Fed," says one prominent investor.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the plight of their clients, average Americans, continues to worsen, and as they age, their standard of living will drop further.\par \par \uc2 "It is thus now impossible for retirees to ensure quality of life and others to save for secure retirement through the deposit and investment options suitable for and available to low/modest-income households," argues Karen Petrou, managing partner of \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "Current income-distribution distortions are thus likely only to get worse faster as savings fall into ever deeper holes. Contemplate rising inflation without rising savings returns and be particularly afraid." Indeed.\par \par \uc2 henny.sender@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160927ec9r00023\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Mainland Chinese companies fuel surge in tower-buying in Hong Kong, hoping to raise their international profiles\b0\par\par\uc2 By Anjie Zheng \par \uc2 842 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 September 2016\par 19:48\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 HONG KONG\u8212\'20\'14As demand from mainland China sends office rents in Hong Kong soaring, some companies are choosing a higher-ticket strategy: buying entire skyscrapers.\par \par \uc2 Mainland Chinese companies have already spent $3.65 billion buying office space in Hong Kong this year, more than half the $6.31 billion they had spent in total since 2009, according to data from \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Most recently, Cheung Kei Group, a private investment firm based in the neighboring Chinese megacity of Shenzhen, spent US$580.1 million in July to buy One HarbourGate's East Tower on the seafront in Kowloon, the northern part of Hong Kong. Last November, China's largest insurance company, \uc2 China Life Insurance\uc2 , bought the West Tower for $754.1 million.\par \par \uc2 The surge in tower-buying from the mainland is one way around Hong Kong's sky-high rents, the priciest in the world. At an annual $278.50 a square foot for prime office space, rental rates are on average nearly 80% higher in Hong Kong than in Manhattan, according to an annual ranking by property consultancy Knight Frank.\par \par \uc2 Brokers say another aim for many Chinese companies looking to expand in Hong Kong is to find a flashy address in prestigious locales. Many companies want buildings on which they can "put a big, shiny sign," said Rhodri James, executive director of offices at real-estate brokerage \uc2 CBRE Group\uc2 . China Life, for example, has already renamed the One HarbourGate's West Tower as the China Life Center.\par \par \uc2 Chinese interest has pushed up Hong Kong building prices to the point that they are rarely attractive investment opportunities to other companies, said Denis Ma, head of research at \uc2 Jones Lang LaSalle\uc2  in Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 The flurry of buying by mainland investors has pushed the yields, or the amount made on rents divided by the price of a building, down to 2.5% to 3% from 4% just four years ago, said Mr. Ma.\par \par \uc2 Hong Kong, a part of China that still operates under a separate legal system, remains the top destination for mainland Chinese investors looking to buy commercial property abroad. Chinese companies have spent $3.65 billion on commercial property here since January, compared with $2.94 billion in New York and $1.48 billion in London, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Major Chinese companies have owned prominent buildings in the city's main financial district for several years. At night, neon signs on the China Construction Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China towers, owned by two of China's biggest banks, shine near the knifelike Bank of China building, designed by I.M. Pei and one of the city's most iconic structures.\par \par \uc2 The latest wave of Chinese buyers say Hong Kong property can help build their international profile.\par \par \uc2 Chinese builder Evergrande Real Estate said its US$1.61 billion purchase of the Mass Mutual Tower last November would "drastically enhance the group's corporate image in Hong Kong as well as international markets, which could significantly boost the group's brand promotion."\par \par \uc2 The deal for the tower, which closed in January, is the second-most expensive Chinese purchase of commercial property globally this year, behind \uc2 China Life Insurance\uc2  and partners' purchase of New York's PaineWebber Building for $1.65 billion in May, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The desire among Chinese investors for Hong Kong buildings comes as big Chinese real-estate developers also are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-chinese-developers-push-into-hong-kong-market-1468938361"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bidding up the price}}}\uc2  of public land in the city.\par \par \uc2 Closer financial ties are also bringing in more Chinese companies. Hong Kong's stock exchange already has a trading link with the exchange in Shanghai, and a similar link with the Shenzhen market is due to open later this year.\par \par \uc2 While Chinese companies still prefer to buy in Hong Kong's central business district, their desire to own is so great and supply so scarce that some will settle for high-profile buildings elsewhere in the city.\par \par \uc2 Asset manager China Everbright Ltd. bought the Dah Sing Financial Center in February for US$1.29 billion in Wan Chai, a secondary business district, to use as its Hong Kong headquarters. The company said it will mainly use the building itself, as business in Hong Kong is growing fast, and "is considering" renaming the building.\par \par \uc2 One stumbling block for prospective Chinese buyers is the lack of buildings on sale. Despite the surge in Chinese buying, the commercial property market here isn't as liquid as those in London or New York, said Mr. James of CBRE.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of the Hong Kong developers are here for the long term, and won't change their strategy by putting their core buildings up for sale," he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Anjie Zheng at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Anjie.Zheng@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Anjie.Zheng@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Property Report\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mall-owners-go-on-defensive-to-rescue-aeropostale-1474968602"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mall Owners Go on Defensive to Rescue A\u233\'00\'E9ropostale}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-offers-payment-insurance-for-apartment-hunters-1475000792"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Startup Offers Payment Insurance for Apartment Hunters}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160927ec9r005br\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Altiscale Inc\uc2 ., one of the first startups to offer the \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  software Hadoop as an online service, said it has been acquired by \uc2 SAP SE\uc2 . Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.\par \par \uc2 "Early on we naively thought the biggest problem a company had was an infrastructure problem, running Hadoop at scale," said founder and Chief Executive \uc2 Raymie Stata\uc2 . "\u8230\'20\'26But if you look at the journey from new data sources available to transformative changes in business processes, it was a lot longer journey than we assumed."\par \par \uc2 Altiscale\uc2  had raised about $42 million from \uc2 Sequoia Capital\uc2 , General Catalyst Partners, Northgate, Accel Partners, AME Cloud Ventures, \uc2 Boston Seed Capital\uc2  and angel investors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stata, a former chief technology officer and chief architect at Yahoo Inc. where Hadoop was first developed, founded \uc2 Altiscale\uc2  in 2012 with the idea that the startup could take away some the complexity of using Hadoop. But the company had trouble growing.\par \par \uc2 Altiscale\uc2  considered raising more funding, and about a year ago, in an effort to jump-start its business, introduced a software layer on top of Hadoop to help customers analyze their data. The company was also developing analytic templates for customers in vertical markets like financial services and health care.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 SAP\uc2  was "way ahead of us on both scores," he said.\par \par \uc2 Altiscale\uc2  will become a business unit of \uc2 SAP\uc2 , and Mr. Stata said he felt good about the outcome. "More often than not you fail outright" he said. "...Only once in a while do companies make it all the way through to an IPO."\par \par \uc2 Other Hadoop companies have also struggled as the market for \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  software proves harder to crack than investors first assumed. \uc2 Hortonworks Inc\uc2 . has seen its market cap cut in half, to about $500 million since its public debut in 2014. \uc2 MapR Technologies Inc\uc2 ., which is still private, raised a down round in August and has since named a new CEO, with founder and former CEO \uc2 John Schroeder\uc2  becoming executive chairman.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160927ec9r007n2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Color Genomics Inc., which has introduced low-cost genetic tests for cancer in an effort to make them easily accessible, has raised $45 million in Series B financing.\par \par \uc2 General Catalyst Partners\uc2  is leading the round, which included existing investors Susan L. Wagner, pop singer Bono, 8VC, Emerson Collective and \uc2 Khosla Ventures\uc2 . Color Genomics, formed in 2013 and launched two years later, has raised $60 million in total. Ms. Wagner is co-founder of asset-management firm BlackRock Inc.\par \par \uc2 Color's product, which physicians order for patients, is a 30-gene test for hereditary forms of cancer, including breast, colorectal, prostate, stomach and uterine cancers. The company focuses on high-impact genes that, when mutated, dramatically increase the risk of developing cancer, according to co-founder and Chief Executive Elad Gil.\par \par \uc2 Burlingame, Calif.-based {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://getcolor.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Color}}}\uc2  uses software and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to increase quality, lower costs and remove human error from genetic testing, according to Dr. Gil. Its 30-gene test sells for $249; some genetic tests that sell for thousands of dollars, he said. Although not covered by insurance, Color tests are affordable to many people, and the company is trying make them more accessible to those at particularly high risk for cancers with hereditary risk.\par \par \uc2 Color is collaborating with the BRCA Foundation and private donors to offer genetic testing to parents, siblings and adult children of people with gene mutations for $50. Some companies also offer Color tests as a benefit, including \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 ., the \uc2 Sacramento Kings\uc2 , \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  and \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , Dr. Gil said.\par \par \uc2 Color, which operates in a market with large companies such as \uc2 Myriad Genetics Inc\uc2 . and smaller players like \uc2 Invitae Corp\uc2 ., also collaborates with cancer researchers. This includes an alliance with the University of California system on a study to determine if a personalized approach to breast cancer screening based on a person's risk profile is as effective as annual mammograms.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wagner and General Catalyst Managing Director \uc2 Hemant Taneja\uc2  are joining the board.\par \par \uc2 Write to Brian Gormley at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:brian.gormley@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 brian.gormley@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160927ec9r004sb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

Davies   \par \uc2 493 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)\par \uc2 AWSJ\par B1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The insurance industry is in a tight spot. This is most obvious in property reinsurance, but that is one symptom of a squeeze across the sector.\par \par \uc2 Global catastrophe reinsurance prices fell this year below levels last seen in 2001 before the destruction of the World Trade Center, according to Guy Carpenter, a risk-and-reinsurance specialist owned by brokers \uc2 Marsh & McLennan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The question for property-and-casualty insurers isn't only whether reinsurance pricing will find a floor, but how much the industry is starting to amplify financial and actuarial risks now.\par \par \uc2 Ultralow investment returns are hurting profits while drawing a wider range of yield-hungry investors into becoming suppliers of alternative capital to underwrite reinsurance risks. At the same time, the lack of costly disasters in recent years has helped a surfeit of capital build up, making it cheap.\par \par \uc2 The drop in prices is slowing, according to \uc2 Moody's\uc2 , but they are still declining. Similarly, the growth of alternative capital in catastrophe bonds and other vehicles is slowing, but it isn't going away.\par \par \uc2 And while some see these trends as early indicators that reinsurance prices may find a floor, there is another problem: Demand for reinsurance from ordinary insurers has continued to slow, too. That is because ordinary property insurance is suffering low demand itself. Insurance demand is linked to economic activity, which globally has been sluggish.\par \par \uc2 But as well as slower cyclical growth in many markets, ordinary insurers are also facing longer-term changes that might permanently cut the amount of insurance people and firms need, such as better risk management or use of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Insurers' options to improve returns to shareholders then are few. One is to take on more insurance risk. Another is to increase balance-sheet leverage.\par \par \uc2 Reinsurers are writing policies with higher probable maximum losses, according to \uc2 Moody's\uc2 , especially those linked to U.S. hurricanes. The largest loss reinsurers expect from a one-in-250-year-size U.S. hurricane event is equivalent to 16% of their equity this year, on average, up almost 2 percentage points from last year, leaving reinsurers more exposed to natural catastrophe despite lower pricing, \uc2 Moody's\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 There also are fears that ordinary insurers will become more aggressive with reserving policies, putting aside less money to cover expected claims, to boost underwriting profits, according to CreditSights, a research firm. That will hurt tomorrow's profits if they underestimate today's claims.\par \par \uc2 Finally, reinsurers hunting for new business are trying to sell more structured policies designed to release capital from ordinary insurers' balance sheets, which can fund shareholder payouts or investments elsewhere. That risks concentrating the industry's capital safety net in fewer hands and adding leverage to the system as a whole. Left unchecked, increasing leverage and higher risk could see the industry itself heading for catastrophe.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20160926000039"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020160926ec9r00012\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Pre-tax profits for \uc2 UBS\uc2 's wealth management division dropped 23.5 per cent in the first half of 2016 compared with the same period last year.\par \par \uc2 Invitees were either owners or managers of private companies. \uc2 UBS\uc2  says insights collected from these clients are being used to challenge its own "house" views and to develop short-term trading ideas as well as longer-term investment themes.\par \par \uc2 "We bank half of the world's billionaires and have a tremendously valuable network of clients among private companies. We share the information gathered through that network with them to identify risks and opportunities for their businesses," says Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer of UBS Wealth Management.\par \par \uc2 Alongside employing new digital tools, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Mr Haefele says the Swiss company is experimenting with cameras that can measure facial micro-responses to assess clients' reactions when shown how their portfolios might perform during a variety of growth and inflation scenarios.\par \par \uc2 Paolo Sironi, a fintech strategist at \uc2 IBM\uc2 , the US technology company, says regulatory changes and downward pressure on fees are transforming the business model of private banks.\par \par \uc2 "It is no longer enough to be a packaging machine for financial products. Private banks need to demonstrate the value of their investment advice and help clients become more capable of dealing with the uncertainties of financial markets," he says.\par \par \uc2 John Hulsman\uc2 , a foreign policy expert, presented two negative scenarios to clients to discuss during their time at the Churchill War Rooms . The first examined how the Syrian war and refugee crisis might threaten political and financial stability in Europe and the second focused on the threat of another financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 In the first scenario, participants concluded that more than a million immigrants were likely to enter Germany next year, precipitating the downfall of Chancellor \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  and widespread political disarray across Europe .\par \par \uc2 In answer to the second scenario, participants felt that the structure of the \uc2 EU\uc2  was a potential catalyst for a wider financial crisis because of the challenges facing its overly complex and inflexible political system .\par \par \uc2 A crisis originating from China was also identified as a risk, as participants felt it was difficult to assess the contagion effects of any significant weaknesses emerging in the country's economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr Haefele says: "These scenarios have been repeatedly highlighted in our conversations with these clients as the key risks that would have the greatest impact on their businesses."\par \par \uc2 Greg Davies, a former head of behavioural finance at \uc2 Barclays Wealth\uc2 , says banks organise war games for their own staff but it is "very novel" to see clients invited to such an exercise.\par \par \uc2 "War games help the military prepare for uncertainty and teach them how to adapt dynamically when their plans no longer work in the real world. Investors often have very blinkered views, which is dangerous in financial markets, and a war game allows ideas to be challenged in an acceptable way," he says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020160926ec9q0000b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 FTV Capital\uc2 , a growth-equity firm that invests in enterprise technology, financial services and payments companies, said it completed fundraising for its fifth fund, which gathered $850 million.\par \par \uc2 The fund, FTV V LP, reached its hard cap and was "significantly oversubscribed," the firm said in a news release.\par \par \uc2 FTV was seeking $700 million for the fund, WSJ Pro Private Equity {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ftv-seeks-700-million-for-fifth-fund-1467320699"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reported in June}}}\uc2 , citing a filing with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The firm closed the fund's predecessor, FTV IV LP, in 2014. That vehicle raised $700 million, exceeding a $500 million target. FTV has been investing from the fourth fund, adding four new portfolio companies so far this year.\par \par \uc2 Returning investors in the fund include Skandia Mutual Life Insurance Co., \uc2 Hillman Co\uc2 ., New York pension funds and funds and accounts managed by NB Alternatives Advisers, said \uc2 Karen Derr Gilbert\uc2 , a partner at the firm. FTV added \uc2 Texas Municipal Retirement System\uc2  as a new investor.\par \par \uc2 Fund V, the firm's largest vehicle to date gathered capital quickly, holding a first closing on June 30 followed by a final closing on Sept. 15, Ms. Gilbert said.\par \par \uc2 The firm took on limited partner commitments for the first time for its third fund and received high demand from existing investors to reup their commitments in the latest fund, which had an attrition rate in the single digits, she said.\par \par \uc2 Brad Bernstein, a managing partner at FTV, said the firm hasn't invested from the new fund yet and expects its fourth fund to yield a couple more investments.\par \par \uc2 FTV invests $10 million to $85 million in companies with annual revenue of $10 million to $100 million. The San Francisco firm invests in companies in enterprise software as a service; data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 ; asset management; banking; health-care payments; online commerce; cross-border payments; and fraud prevention, among other sectors.\par \par \uc2 ReliaQuest LLC, a provider of information technology security services, in June said it secured a $30 million investment led by FTV. The firm this year purchased a minority share of U.K.-based financial services and technology company True Potential LLP. FTV also this year led a $76 million investment in the VPay unit of payment services company StoneEagle Services Inc. and a $30 million investment in electronic foreign-exchange provider Edgewater Markets LLC.\par \par \uc2 (Correction: \uc2 FTV Capital\uc2  took on limited partner commitments for the first time for its third fund. A previous version of this article stated the firm first took on LP commitments for its fourth fund.)\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160926ec9q0043a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Canvas later hired \uc2 Paul Hsiao\uc2  from \uc2 New Enterprise Associates\uc2  and Ben Narasin, a seed investor, to create a team of four investing partners for the new fund.\par \par \uc2 Canvas generally invests between $5 million and $20 million in a company through Series A and B rounds, although it will do seed investments if the partner requesting it is willing to commit both money and time.\par \par \uc2 "It's easy to write checks for seed investments, and this is a way to stay disciplined," Mr. Little said. "If partners are not willing to commit time, then why put capital in?"\par \par \uc2 Canvas will continue to look for fintech and health-care IT companies to back, although the firm is also interested in hardware and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The size of Canvas's second fund was carefully chosen to please limited partners, who like the returns on smaller funds, and entrepreneurs, who value the stability signaled by a larger fund, Mr. Little said.\par \par \uc2 One Canvas investor, Julie Vollenweider, who heads the private-equity investment team at \uc2 Emory University\uc2 , said her team invested because their due diligence showed Canvas's partners spend time with the companies they back. She also liked the partners' mix of investing and operating experience, she said.\par \par \uc2 Canvas hasn't started investing the new fund. Previous investments by the partners include \uc2 LendingClub Corp\uc2 ., which has gone public; Dropcam, which was acquired by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2 ; \uc2 TellApart\uc2 , which was acquired by \uc2 Twitter Inc\uc2 .; and Check, which was acquired by \uc2 Intuit Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Write to Deborah Gage at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:deborah.gage.@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 deborah.gage.@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160926ec9q004eg\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Twitter Deal\par \par \uc2 Is Too Much\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Salesforce\par \par \uc2 Money may be burning a hole in \uc2 Marc Benioff\uc2 's pocket. So far, his investors are the ones getting singed.\par \par \uc2 The ambitious chief executive of Salesforce.com made no secret of his effort to grab \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  from the clutches of \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  a few months back.\par \par \uc2 Now, his eyes have reportedly turned to another beaten-down internet name: \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Media reports Friday said that the cloud software firm is exploring a potential deal with the microblogging site. The talks are said to be at an early stage.\par \par \uc2 It should be noted that this is the latest in a long-running chain of rumors involving \uc2 Twitter.Previous\uc2  rumors have involved media companies, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and pretty much any other tech company with a decent-sized wallet.\par \par \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  is a new entrant to that list -- also a puzzling one. The company sells subscription-based enterprise software to large businesses -- a very different industry than advertising.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Benioff has spoken previously of an "M&A window" created by a harsh selloff in software and internet companies earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  fits that bill, at least. Its shares were down 19% for the year before Friday's reports, as its once-rapid growth has stalled. But that doesn't make \uc2 Twitter\uc2  any sort of bargain.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Twitter\uc2  commanded a similar deal multiple to \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  of about 6.8 times forward sales, that would put the price in the $18 billion range, which is $18 billion more than what \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  has in net cash. A lot, in other words, to chase a highly speculative dream.\par \par \uc2 -- Dan Gallagher\par \par \uc2 Sheds Are the New Shops in U.K.\par \par \uc2 Move over skyscrapers and shopping malls: The hottest commercial-property investment on the global market is the humble distribution warehouse. There is always a good reason to be wary, but there is at least one way to play an emerging trend in the industry.\par \par \uc2 Distribution sheds -- sometimes called big boxes after their functional design -- used to be largely ignored by major property investors. The old argument was that location mattered less for industrial real estate than it did for shops and offices, so landlords couldn't count on supply constraints to boost rents.\par \par \uc2 E-commerce has upended the picture. Retailers -- both online-only players such as \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2  and bricks-and-mortar chains -- are rushing to rent distribution space to serve online orders. Typically, they want a huge hub in the middle of an operating region -- U.K. real-estate folk talk of a "golden triangle" between three motorways in mid-England -- combined with smaller units on the edges of major metropolitan areas.\par \par \uc2 Shops sit on the other side of this trend. Malls that once dominated their areas suddenly have found themselves with competition from the internet. Retail-property valuations in many places have fallen into relative decline.\par \par \uc2 The obvious response is to shift money out of shops and into sheds. But investors need to tread carefully, for three reasons.\par \par \uc2 First, shares in most distribution specialists, including U.S. giant Prologis and U.K. players LondonMetric and \uc2 Tritax Big Box\uc2 , trade at premiums to underlying book values. Buying them now, therefore, comes with the risk that sentiment cools.\par \par \uc2 Another risk is overdevelopment. Precise location doesn't matter like it does with retailers, making it easy to boost supply. \uc2 Credit Suisse Group\uc2  last month noted "mounting risks of oversupply" in China.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the appeal of property as a long-term, bond-like investment sits uneasily with the theme of accelerating technological change.\par \par \uc2 A compromise could be industrial space close to cities, coveted by e-commerce players for its proximity to homes but also suitable for housing. An active player around London is Segro, whose shares trade at a discount to book value. They could be a useful source of e-commerce exposure for property investors late to the big-box party.\par \par \uc2 -- Stephen Wilmot\par \par \uc2 A Storm Is Looming for the Property Insurance Sector\par \par \uc2 The insurance industry is in a tight spot. This is most obvious in property reinsurance, but that is one symptom of a squeeze across the sector.\par \par \uc2 Global catastrophe reinsurance prices fell this year below levels last seen in 2001 before the destruction of the World Trade Center, according to Guy Carpenter, a risk and reinsurance specialist owned by brokers \uc2 Marsh & McLennan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The question for property-and-casualty insurers isn't only whether reinsurance pricing will find a floor, but also how much the industry is starting to amplify financial and actuarial risks now.\par \par \uc2 Ultralow investment returns are hurting profits while drawing a wider range of yield-hungry investors into becoming suppliers of alternative capital to underwrite reinsurance risks. At the same time, the lack of costly disasters in recent years has helped a surfeit of capital build up, making it cheap.\par \par \uc2 The drop in prices is slowing, according to \uc2 Moody's\uc2 , but they are still declining. Similarly, the growth of alternative capital in the form of catastrophe bonds and other vehicles is slowing, but it isn't going away.\par \par \uc2 And while some see these trends as early indicators that reinsurance prices may find a floor, there is another problem: Demand for reinsurance from ordinary insurers continued to slow, too.\par \par \uc2 That is because ordinary property insurance is suffering low demand itself. Insurance demand is linked to economic activity, which globally has been sluggish.\par \par \uc2 But ordinary insurers are also facing longer-term changes that might permanently cut the amount of insurance people and firms need, such as better risk management or use of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Insurers' options to improve returns to shareholders then are few. One is to take on more insurance risk. Another is to increase balance-sheet leverage. There are signs that the industry is doing both.\par \par \uc2 Reinsurers are writing policies with higher probable maximum losses, according to \uc2 Moody's\uc2 , especially those linked to U.S. hurricanes. U.S. storms are the biggest area of the catastrophe market because there is more insured property in the line of fire than for any other regularly expected event.\par \par \uc2 There also are fears that ordinary insurers will become more aggressive with reserving policies, putting aside less money to cover expected claims, to boost underwriting profits, according to CreditSights, a research firm. That will hurt tomorrow's profits if they underestimate today's claims.\par \par \uc2 Finally, reinsurers hunting for new business are trying to sell more structured policies designed to release capital from ordinary insurers' balance sheets, which can fund shareholder payouts or investments elsewhere. That risks concentrating the industry's capital safety net in fewer hands and adding leverage to the system.\par \par \uc2 Left unchecked, increasing leverage and higher risk could see the industry itself heading for catastrophe.\par \par \uc2 -- Paul J. Davies\par \par \uc2 Overheard\par \par \uc2 The maestro just ain't what he used to be. Or is he?\par \par \uc2 Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned in a Bloomberg interview on Thursday that yields on the benchmark \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  note could rise to 5%. That would mean a paper loss of about 25%, though he didn't suggest it would occur overnight.\par \par \uc2 The yield promptly sank to a two-week low. How different it was 20 years ago, when Mr. Greenspan gave his famous "irrational exuberance" speech about technology stocks: The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.4% from its intraday high to the following session's low.\par \par \uc2 After that, Mr. Greenspan's warning was ignored, and the index soared another 280% in a little over three years before sinking nearly 80%. His bond warning may be right eventually, too, but this time it has been ignored from the start.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20160926000021"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020160926ec9q0000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Private banks need to demonstrate the value of their investment advice and help clients become more capable of dealing with the uncertainties of financial markets,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 John Hulsman\uc2 , a foreign policy expert, presented two negative scenarios to clients to discuss during their time at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/churchill-war-rooms"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Churchill War Rooms  }}}\uc2 . The first examined how the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/indepth/syria-crisis"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Syrian war  }}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/migration"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 refugee crisis  }}}\uc2  might threaten political and financial stability in Europe and the second focused on the threat of another financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 In the first scenario, participants concluded that more than a million immigrants were likely to enter Germany next year, precipitating the downfall of Chancellor {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/topics/people/Angela_Merkel"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Angela Merkel  }}}\uc2  and widespread political disarray across Europe.\par \par \uc2 In answer to the second scenario, participants felt that the structure of the \uc2 EU\uc2  was a potential catalyst for a wider financial crisis because of the challenges facing its overly complex and inflexible political system.\par \par \uc2 A crisis originating from China was also identified as a risk, as participants felt it was difficult to assess the contagion effects of any significant weaknesses emerging in the country\u8217\'20\'19s economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr Haefele says: \u8220\'20\'1CThese scenarios have been repeatedly highlighted in our conversations with these clients as the key risks that would have the greatest impact on their businesses.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Greg Davies, a former head of behavioural finance at \uc2 Barclays Wealth\uc2 , says banks organise war games for their own staff but it is \u8220\'20\'1Cvery novel\u8221\'20\'1D to see clients invited to such an exercise.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWar games help the military prepare for uncertainty and teach them how to adapt dynamically when their plans no longer work in the real world. Investors often have very blinkered views, which is dangerous in financial markets, and a war game allows ideas to be challenged in an acceptable way,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160925ec9p000h4\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Mr Sato said the rule changes would accelerate that. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have created a specific team, which is the innovation product team, to make significant investment in venture companies. We are sending many many persons to the US.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Rakuten, the Japanese ecommerce group, has launched a $100m fund to invest in fintech companies and \uc2 SBI Holdings\uc2 , a financial group, raised a \u165\'00\'A530bn ($299m) fintech venture fund earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Other global banks have opened outposts in California. \uc2 BBVA\uc2 , the Spanish bank, is one of the most aggressive, acquiring Simple, an Oregon-based digital lender in 2014, and investing in Prosper, the San Francisco-based peer-to-peer platform. It also set up a venture capital company, Propel Ventures, to pursue investments in other start-ups.\par \par \uc2 In Japan, the push to nurture homegrown fintech ventures and for banks to go abroad in search of technology to acquire, is linked to admiration and unease about the way the US has been able to build sizeable fintech companies. Among private \u8220\'20\'1Cunicorns\u8221\'20\'1D, Stripe, the payments company, is valued at $5bn, while SoFi, the alternative lender, is valued at $4bn and has an investment from Japan\u8217\'20\'19s SoftBank.\par \par \uc2 Among public companies, \uc2 LendingClub\uc2 , the marketplace lender, is among the most prominent, even though it has latterly suffered from self-inflicted problems.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Taro Aso\uc2 , deputy prime minister, suggested that some of the same spirit needed to be instilled in Tokyo. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have revised the Banking Act and, through the revision, people in banks, in business suits work together with young people in T-shirts and jeans. They work together and the combination of this gives rise to new things.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8220\'20\'1CThe financial ministry which used to regulate the industry must now nurture the industry. We are making efforts towards this end. We haven\u8217\'20\'19t done enough but with this new policy we have greatly changed our thinking in approaching the issues.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020160925ec9p0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 In the brave new world of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , no good deed will go unnoticed and no bad deed will go unpunished. Or so at least the dream goes.\par \par \uc2 The proposition here is simple. Soon enough, telematics companies will gather data from all our connected devices, fitbits and cars, scrutinise it intricately, then determine whether we are \u8220\'20\'1Cgood\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Cbad\u8221\'20\'1D agents. Good behaviours will be rewarded with cheaper insurance policies, bad ones will be penalised. The relative cost of being a bad agent, meanwhile, will incentivise good behaviours, eliminating evil from our world forever. Amen.\par \par \uc2 If you thought that was a far fetched vision, however, you\u8217\'20\'19d be mistaken. The burgeoning telematics sector is well on its way to partnering up with insurance companies, automakers and more. And in almost all cases the companies believe actuarial or insurance services are the best path towards the monetisation of their data intensive business models.\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s only one problem. Personalising insurance contracts to this degree undermines the whole concept of insurance.\par \par \uc2 Insurance doesn\u8217\'20\'19t really work unless risk is pooled in such a way that good agents pay over the odds to the benefit of the bad ones.\par \par \uc2 A world where insurance is personally tailored to reflect every individual\u8217\'20\'19s behavioural history is consequently a world wherein unfettered discrimination becomes the celebrated norm, where only the super rich, the super gifted, the super lucky or the genetically well-endowed will ever be allowed to drive fast, eat bad food or to take any risk at all. As a consequence, it\u8217\'20\'19s also a world where the poor or physically under-privileged become uninsurable (unless, of course, they\u8217\'20\'19re prepared to be permanently tracked, controlled and monitored by their data overlords).\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s hard communicating this point to techies though, who like to say things like: \u8220\'20\'1CIf you\u8217\'20\'19re a good citizen with nothing to hide, what\u8217\'20\'19s the problem with sharing your data?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Luckily (phew) the FCA is nudging towards recognising the brutally Darwinian social side-effects. On Wednesday, they published {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-feedback-statement-big-data-call-input"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  this  }}}\uc2 . If you\u8217\'20\'19re a big investor in a telematics or \b \highlight22\uc2 big data analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm betting that insurance holds the key to your monetisation dreams, it\u8217\'20\'19s worth paying attention to, not least because they note things like:\par \par \uc2 There is the potential for \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  to increase risk segmentation and consequently lead to consumers with higher risks being unable to obtain affordable insurance. We carried out a further review of parts of the GI sector and this indicated these concerns were not yet materialising. However, we will remain alert to the potential exclusion of higher risk customers and will engage with government if concerns begin to develop because of how firms are using \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The increasing amount of data from a wider range of sources, alongside sophisticated analytical tools, might lead to factors other than risk and cost in pricing becoming more prevalent.\par \par \uc2 There seems to be an inherent conflict with the idea that socially conscious tech start-up firms that \u8220\'20\'1Cwant to make the world a better place\u8221\'20\'1D can both monetise \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  profitably and equalise or liberate society.\par \par \uc2 Related links:\par \par \uc2 When a man cannot choose, is he still a consumer? \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 Tesco\uc2  sees you coming \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 Subprime lending + cars + robotic repo men = financial journalism gold \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 Mythbusting finance 2.0 \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 When financial inclusion stands for financial intrusion \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160922ec9m00565\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Jenkins, Jr.   \par \uc2 862 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)\par \uc2 WSJE\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 "To meet quotas, employees have opened unneeded accounts for customers, ordered credit cards without customers' permission and forged client signatures on paperwork. Some employees begged family members to open ghost accounts."\par \par \uc2 So reported the \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  three years ago, opening a window on a snafu at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  that, by now, has led to the dismissal of more than 5,000 employees, $185 million in fines and Tuesday's abject appearance of CEO \uc2 John Stumpf\uc2  before the Senate Banking Committee.\par \par \uc2 You get what you pay for. In the language of incentives, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  certainly did. It rewarded employees for signing customers to new accounts, so some employees -- in pursuit of bonuses or job security -- created fake accounts or signed up customers for credit cards they didn't authorize.\par \par \uc2 The funny thing is, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  itself gained nothing from this. In most cases, when a fee appeared on their statement for a service they never authorized, customers rejected it. \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  bore the personnel and paperwork cost of opening the account and then the personnel and paperwork cost of closing it. The employee got a paycheck, possibly a bonus. \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  got nothing but additional costs.\par \par \uc2 How different from the strategies of misdirection and exploitation of our cognitive biases that we normally see companies using to maximize revenue from customers. By making it easy to sign up and hard to cancel, cable operators generate monthly payments from customers who would otherwise cancel. Supermarkets arrange their layouts to maximize our propensity to buy and manipulate our perceptions of value. Or take the typical corporate phone tree: Is it not an instrument devilishly designed to facilitate transactions that yield revenue (i.e., sales) while frustrating those that produce costs (complaints, returns, warranty claims)?\par \par \uc2 All these things pay off or companies wouldn't do them. Yet \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , with its clumsily designed system for rewarding cross-selling, essentially afflicted itself with its own internal cognitive bias that employees could exploit to get paid for creating fake accounts that generated little or no revenue or profit for \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 . As the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  last week explained, "In some cases, the employee would create a phony email address -- noname@wellsfargo.com was often used, according to regulators -- in order to get credit for setting up an online account the customer didn't request."\par \par \uc2 Does this depress you? Perhaps it shouldn't.\par \par \uc2 Even as \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  gives companies more power, in the least attractive instances, to exploit their customers, learning and technology also operate on the other side. Whole businesses, with names like BillFixers and BillCutterz, now exist to help customers knock down their TV or phone bills. Videos on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  walk you through how to cancel a service. The web is full of advice on how to manipulate the customer-service reps who are trying to manipulate you. One example: If the first rep isn't proving tractable enough, hang up and dial again and try your luck with another.\par \par \uc2 The big difference here is that \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  was defrauding itself -- via incentives it gave its own employees to treat \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  the way many companies treat their customers.\par \par \uc2 No, a solution to this latest banking scandal is not more regulation -- as if making what's already illegal more illegal will stop it from happening. (Notice, it doesn't work with murder.) As numerous media reports make clear, the bank's sales force consisted of workers making less than $12 an hour. Many were obviously there for a paycheck and benefits, not a career, which perhaps made cheating to meet a sales quota seem a reasonable trade-off.\par \par \uc2 All companies operate on incentives and systems that aren't perfect. \uc2 Comcast\uc2  means for its "retention specialists" to win back irate customers, not bully them in ways that end up on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 . Yet it happens.\par \par \uc2 The media and politicians also operate on systems of incentives: See the pundits who, confronted with the \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  snafu and the need to fill space or airtime, run out formulaic demands for resignations and regulation that they run out with every corporate scandal. See Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in Tuesday's hearing, in Trump-like fashion distorting the nature of the \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  scandal as if truth and logic don't matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf, in his mea culpa on Capitol Hill, correctly apologized for not moving more quickly but also correctly insisted there was "no orchestrated effort or scheme" to encourage sales practices that only hurt the bank. Though two million possibly unauthorized accounts over five years sounds like a lot, remember, this is a company with 8,000-plus branches and 268,000 employees, whose customers hold hundreds of millions of accounts of various kinds.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately the problem with any incentive system is that it can be gamed -- people cheat. \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  isn't the first and won't be the last organization to struggle to patch the in-built cognitive biases in its systems that invite employees to act in ways that serve their interests but not \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 's.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20160922000050"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020160922ec9m0001d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Overall, two-thirds of the companies questioned said they expected to be using blockchain within five years.\par \par \uc2 For financial services groups, blockchain is attractive as it means there is no intermediary to pay for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/08/12/2172779/how-global-money-transfers-will-work-in-the-future/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 certain transactions }}}\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 offering scope to cut costs. A Santander report published in 2015 suggested that global banks could save up to $20bn a year by 2022 by implementing the nascent technology.\par \par \uc2 However, the widespread introduction of blockchain could also drive many ill-prepared asset managers out of business, according to the Wealth and Asset Management 2021 report by Roubini ThoughtLab \u8212\'20\'14 a consultancy co-founded by author and economist \uc2 Nouriel Roubini\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTechnology is a tsunami that will radically change the face of financial services,\u8221\'20\'1D Prof Roubini said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe losers will be those companies that are not nimble enough to adopt the new technology \u8212\'20\'14 and a lot of them may disappear.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Workers in the sector may also suffer, said Prof Roubini, who when working as a \uc2 US Treasury\uc2  official was best known for predicting the US housing crisis of 2007-08.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs you adopt technologies that are capital intensive and offer labour savings, a lot of the workers not in highly skilled positions in financial services will be replaced by software, robots and machines,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  estimates that by 2027, assets equivalent to 10 per cent of global GDP could be held on a blockchain.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re moving from the \u8216\'20\'18internet of information\u8217\'20\'19 to an \u8216\'20\'18internet of value\u8217\'20\'19 where a lot of what financial services firms normally do \u8212\'20\'14 namely acting as a trusted intermediary between parties who may not know each other \u8212\'20\'14 can be significantly automated and improved,\u8221\'20\'1D said Alex Tapscott, co-author of the book Blockchain Revolution, in the Roubini ThoughtLab report. \u8220\'20\'1CThat has a direct impact on the world of investment services.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But the costs of implementing new technologies \u8212\'20\'14 including social media, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and mobile apps, as well as blockchain \u8212\'20\'14 could prove prohibitively high for some smaller firms. \uc2 UBS\uc2 , for example, is investing SFr1bn in new technologies across the spectrum.\par \par \uc2 If blockchain can cut transaction costs, though, it might ultimately give lower-income investors greater \u8212\'20\'14 and cheaper \u8212\'20\'14 access to markets.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMany more people are interested in both the macro and local markets than ever before,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Yoni Assia\uc2 , chief executive of eToro, a social trading site based in Israel.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut very few people actually act on these ideas. Now, with a very low barrier to entry, it means more people have the chance to enter the capital markets world of trading and investing.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020160921ec9l0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MasterCard Inc\uc2 . plans to launch new biometric technology for verifying customer identities during online shopping transactions in the coming weeks with merchants and banks. The company has been testing facial and fingerprint recognition software, called Identity Check, in the Netherlands, Canada and the U.S., as a way to combat growing online fraud.\par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 MasterCard\uc2  have pushed merchants and consumers to switch from credit cards that use magnetic strips to cards embedded with a computer chip that creates a unique code for each transaction, retail fraud patterns have shifted. For the 33% of \uc2 MasterCard\uc2  merchants that have adopted chip technology, fraud from counterfeit cards has dropped by 54%, said \uc2 Ajay Bhalla\uc2 , president of enterprise security solutions at \uc2 MasterCard\uc2 . Criminals have regrouped to focus on internet transactions, where no physical card is used.\par \par \uc2 "Fraudsters have a business model, too, so we see [fraud] moving to 'card not present' transactions," Mr. Bhalla said.\par \par \uc2 In online transactions using Identity Check, the shopper submits a selfie or fingerprint via a mobile app from \uc2 MasterCard\uc2  that authenticates the image. Consumers shopping via laptop or desktop computer would receive requests for the biometric data through text message sent to their smartphones. "The hypothesis is that everybody's carrying a mobile phone," Mr. Bhalla said.\par \par \uc2 The technology is part of a larger effort at \uc2 MasterCard\uc2  to fight online financial fraud that includes a transaction-monitoring system that uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to detect unusual activity and alert banks and merchants. Banks are also experimenting with technology to stop online crime. \uc2 U.S. Bancorp\uc2  is tracking customer cellphones to check location data against the location of a pending credit-card transaction. A match is one indication the purchase is legitimate. \uc2 American Express Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Visa\uc2 , \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . and others are testing eye scans, voice recognition and other biometric technology to better secure transactions.\par \par \uc2 MasterCard\uc2  announced the Identity Check technology last October and has been testing it with \uc2 ABN AMRO Group NV\uc2  in Amsterdam, \uc2 Bank of Montreal\uc2  in Canada and First Tech Federal Credit Union in Palo Alto, Calif.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160921000011"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160921ec9l00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

In August, \uc2 Charter Hall Group\uc2  launched a second fund anchored by properties leased to car dealer \uc2 Automotive Holdings Group\uc2  and is also developing a college campus. Facing an apartment glut partly caused by a surge of foreign investment, property company \uc2 Mirvac Group\uc2  is considering a foray into affordable-housing projects.\par \par \uc2 Driving the shift toward more exotic assets are falling capitalization rates -- a key measure of investment returns from property -- for office blocks, industrial warehouses and shopping malls. They recently dropped close to record lows set before the global financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Analysts blame a lack of supply. According to realtor \uc2 Savills\uc2 , commercial property worth a combined 107 billion Australian dollars (US$80.6 billion) has been sold in the past four years in Australia -- nearly a quarter of the sector's total value. Among the foreign owners of Australian offices and retail malls are U.S.-based \uc2 Blackstone Group\uc2  and Singapore's Frasers Centrepoint, which completed a A$2.6 billion acquisition of Australand in 2014.\par \par \uc2 "Given that level of turnover, it's unsurprising to find out there isn't a lot left for sale, because the people who currently own it want to keep it," said Tony Crabb, \uc2 Savills\uc2 's head of research in Australia.\par \par \uc2 Commercial-property sales in Australia fell 57% to A$10.2 billion in the first half of 2016, says \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Demand for property in Australia, the U.K. and the eurozone has surged in recent years as low interest rates have driven investors around the world to seek riskier assets to boost returns, and the growing stock of capital at sovereign-wealth funds and pension funds looks to find a home. The value of deals across the three markets over the past two years was up nearly 50% on the prior two years, according to RCA.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say overseas interest in Australian commercial real estate has been helped by its relatively high rental yields compared with elsewhere in the world, and political uncertainty such as Brexit in the U.K. and the U.S. presidential election. Australia is viewed as a haven because of its stable political system and economy. Recent free-trade agreements with countries including China and a lower Australian dollar are bolstering the appeal of the market to foreign buyers.\par \par \uc2 In Australia last year, 38% of commercial-property deals over US$10 million involved a foreign party, up from 16% in 2008, \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  says. In the U.S., 20% of deals involved foreign counterparties. The steady stream of foreign capital has helped to drive up prices faster than rents. Still, yields offer a good margin above government bonds and are among the highest globally. According to MSCI's IPD property indexes, Australian yields were at 6.21% in June compared with 4.9% in the U.K. and 4.6% in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 But intensifying competition from foreign buyers is making it tougher for Australian real-estate investment trusts to source the properties they need to maintain growth.\par \par \uc2 That has led Dexus to branch into medical real estate. In an interview, Chief Executive \uc2 Darren Steinberg\uc2  said the A$8.65 billion-valued trust is in talks with several medical-facility operators and he is "reasonably confident" it will be able to launch its first medical fund within two years.\par \par \uc2 He said Dexus's deal with Ramsay for the Sydney hospital sparked interest from local and offshore pension funds wanting exposure to a sector set to benefit from Australia's aging population.\par \par \uc2 "We've had some reverse inquiry from investors that are looking to get invested into the medical space," Mr. Steinberg said. "Obviously, the demographics of that space are quite positive."\par \par \uc2 Over the next 40 years, the government expects the proportion of Australia's population that is more than 65 years old will almost double to around 25%. Unlike in the U.S., Australian property trusts have been slow to invest in health clinics and hospitals.\par \par \uc2 Australia's property-trust sector is dominated by trusts focused on industrial properties, offices and malls. In the U.S. market, 13% of the S&P U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust index is invested in health care, 16% in hotels and resorts, 16% in residential property and 13% in the other specialized categories.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160921000027"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160921ec9l0000k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

JOE DONNELLY, D-IND.\par \par \uc2 Witness: \uc2 John Stumpf\uc2  , chairman and CEO, Wells Fargo & Co.\par \par \uc2 Committee Chairman Richard Shelby: The committee will come to order.\par \par \uc2 Today, we will learn more about the events and the circumstances that led to the enforcement action against \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  by the Los Angeles city attorney, the OCC, and the CFPB. But first today, we will receive testimony from \uc2 John Stumpf\uc2  . He's Wells Fargo's CEO and chairman who is with us today.\par \par \uc2 Welcome, Mr. Stumpf.\par \par \uc2 We will then hear from the Los Angeles city attorney's deputy chief, whose office was the first to commence an action against \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  on this issue; and finally, from the OCC and the CFPB. We look forward to hearing from both panels because much remains unclear about what transpired at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  and the regulators' response.\par \par \uc2 It appears that \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's own analysis concluded that thousands of its employees opened more than 2 million accounts that may not have been authorized. Subsequently, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  terminated approximately 5,300 employees and has agreed to pay $185 million in fines and $5 million in customer remediation.\par \par \uc2 Sales data show that \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  has been an industry leader in its ability to cross-sell products such as credit cards, checking accounts and home equity loans. A number of former \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  employees have described their work environment characterized by intense pressure to meet aggressive and unrealistic sales goals.\par \par \uc2 In a 2010 letter to shareholders, Mr. Stumpf wrote that \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's goal was eight products per customer because eight rhymed with great. The result was a corporate culture that drove company team members to fraudulently open millions of accounts using their customers' funds and personal information without their permission.\par \par \uc2 I've often said that banking is based on trust and that trust was broken at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 While much has been written about these events, I believe there are several questions that warrant answers. First, when did this conduct start at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  and why were the regulators unaware of this growing problem? Second, when did Mr. Stumpf and his senior management become aware of these activities and how did they respond? Third, have all the appropriate \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  employees been held accountable and to what extent? Finally, where were the federal regulators while certain \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  employees were taking advantage of unsuspecting customers over a period of many years?\par \par \uc2 Here's what we do know. \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's internal review only covers unauthorized accounts dating back to 2011. News reports and court documents suggest these problems might have existed long before then. The 2013 Los Angeles Times articles led to the L.A. city attorney's office investigation into \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's sales practices. Thousands of man-hours by a dozen dedicated L.A. city attorneys culminated in a lawsuit filed against \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  in May of 2015.\par \par \uc2 This timeline begs the question: Where were the federal regulators during these years? If the OCC and the CFPB were aware of these issues before the L.A. city attorney's lawsuit, why did they wait until 2016 to bring an enforcement action? Why did it take an L.A. Times reporter to uncover what should have been uncovered by \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's regulators?\par \par \uc2 If there were ever a textbook case where consumers needed protection, this was it. How many millions of unauthorized accounts does it take before the CFPB notices? And while the bureau is billing this as the largest settlement in its history, it's unclear whether it had any significant role in discovering or investigating the bank's conduct.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Just as it is fair to ask Mr. Stumpf what he knew, when he learned it, and what he did about it, it's also fair to ask those same questions of \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's regulators. These simple -- there are simple facts and circumstances, questions that both the OCC and the CFPB should be able to answer without violating any confidentiality restrictions.\par \par \uc2 I look forward to today's hearing as both Congress and the American people especially, the aggrieved consumers, have been kept in the dark for far too long.\par \par \uc2 Senator Brown?\par \par \uc2 Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio): Mr. Chairman, thank you for calling this hearing.\par \par \uc2 I want to commend the city of Los Angeles, the OCC and the CFPB for their actions and in the L.A. Times for bringing this to light. I was stunned when I learned of the breadth and duration of the fraud committed by \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  . I hope today we can begin to understand what went wrong and what needs to be done.\par \par \uc2 I call it fraud because I got tired of the euphemisms a long time ago. I think the American people did, too. This is not a matter of customers who received products and services they did not want or need, as \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  puts it. That makes it sound like there was a mix-up under the Christmas tree and I got the right-handed baseball glove that was meant for my brother Charlie.\par \par \uc2 This is 5,300 employees, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  calls them team members, 5,300 team members forging signatures, stealing identities, Social Security numbers and customers' hard earned cash, so as to hang onto their low- paying jobs and make money for the high paid executives at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  . And they did it for at least -- at least five years.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's reaction has been remarkable. It did not treat this as a big problem until it appeared in the newspapers. It did not begin to make customers whole until this year. And we don't know whether the bank chose to do so or was told they had to do so. \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  is taking out full-page ads claiming it is accountable and accepts responsibility. It has not admitted to responsibility for a single misdeed in the dealings with the city of Los Angeles and the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  claims to have made things right with its customers, but its efforts have been incomplete. For example, it's not clear the PWC calculated the cost of a lower credit score which might be paid every month for 30 years. At times, the bank has been downright hostile to aggrieved customers. Rather than letting fraud victims have their day in court, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  forced customers to abide by the mandatory arbitration clauses in their real accounts. You heard that right. The bank invoked the fine print on a real account to block redress on a fake one which \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  had created.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  team members, many struggling to support a family on $12 or $15 an hour, my understanding is \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  tellers make about $11.80 an hour. \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  team members struggling to support a family on $12 to $15 an hour followed their manager's guidance to do whatever it took to make their quotas. Some may have worked off the clock. Others cut corners to avoid being fired, for missing goals, goals that Wells now admits were too high.\par \par \uc2 They've been accountable, these low-income workers. The workers lost their jobs with no parachute of any color. And it's not just 5300 team members who paid the price, because many more were fired when they couldn't meet the quotas, still more chose to quit rather than cheat.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, \uc2 Ms. Carrie Tolstedt\uc2  , the senior executive vice president for Community Banking, has done quite well. She knew of this problem at least five years ago and is retiring with a package that may be worth more than the CFPB's record fine of $100 million. So 5,300 team members earning perhaps $25,000, $30,000, $35,000 a year have lost their jobs while Ms. Tolstedt walks away with up to $120 million.\par \par \uc2 Despite firing thousands of team members, Ms. Tolstedt apparently decided it was not important enough to alert the head of the company, Mr. Stumpf, or the board of directors or anyone else for two years, if ever, even though you both sat on that bank's board. Senior management and the board of directors apparently agreed once the scandal became public, remedial actions were stepped up against front- line team members, but the praise and performance bonuses continued to be lavished upon Ms. Tolstedt until as recently as two months ago.\par \par \uc2 You would think the lessons of the financial crisis, which came at such a high cost to our country, would change the way that banks do business. And to be fair, many banks did take the lessons of financial crisis to heart, but for the largest banks in this country, every week we hear of a new lawsuit or enforcement action against one of them, week, after week, after week, after week. What are some of these lessons?\par \par \uc2 First, the culture in these banks needs to change. That starts at the top.\par \par \uc2 Second, there must be a reliable way for legitimate complaints to end up in the C suite, rather than a circular file.\par \par \uc2 Third, in the wake of the ramp and robo-signing fraud that we saw at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  and other places, banks need better controls.\par \par \uc2 Because fourth, if you pay people on the basis of how many products they sell that's what they'll do, whether it's in the interest of the customers or not, and based pay needs to be increased.\par \par \uc2 Finally, change the pay structure, at least make incentives deferred so it's clear that customer and company interests are aligned and enduring.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's come up short on all five counts. That conclusion is not just based on this, it's latest scandal. Last year Well's settled with the OCC, for among other things, 11 years worth of deception about deceptive practices and selling enhanced identity theft protection.\par \par \uc2 So at the same time, think about this. The same time the bank was stealing customer identities, it was charging for protecting them. In the Wells -- if the Well's ID theft product, that they sold, didn't discover the fraudulent Well's accounts, perhaps some refunds are due.\par \par \uc2 This April, Well's settled a False Claim Act suit for $1.2 billion, in part because it has used bonus' to get staff quote "to churn out and approve an ever increasing quantity of FHA loans. And applying pressure on loan officers and underwriters, to originate and approve more and more FH loans -- FHA loans-- as quickly as possible" unquote.\par \par \uc2 Thousands of American's we know so well, although, unfortunately, far too few of us know any of these people personally, thousands of American's lost their homes through mortgage foreclosures as a result. So I hope Mr. Stumpf, you will level with this committee and the public, words that come like a San Francisco fog on little cat feet, won't cut it.\par \par \uc2 These were not magically delivered unwanted products. This was fraud. Fraud that you did not find or fraud that you did not fix quickly enough. Instead of focusing a damage control, you need to admit to the problems and fix them and treat your customers, in real life, like you do in your vision statement.\par \par \uc2 That would be the best damage control of all, for you customers, for your bank, for your industry and for our country. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Mr. Stumpf, will you rise and be sworn. Raise your right hand, do you swear and affirm, that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\par \par \uc2 You may be seated. Mr. Stumpf, your written statement will be made part of the hearing record, you proceed as you wish. Welcome to the committee.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Mr. Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Brown and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to be with you today. I am Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Wells Fargo, where I have worked for nearly 35 years. It is my privilege to lead this company, which was founded 164 years ago. And has played a vital role, in the financial history and development of our country.\par \par \uc2 We employee more than 268,000 team members, 95% of whom are in the United States. One in every 600 working adults is a member of the \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  family and we have a presence in all 50 states.\par \par \uc2 I am deeply sorry that we've failed to fulfill on our responsibility to our customers, to our team members and to the American public. I've been through many challenges at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  , but none of which pains me more than the one we will discuss this morning.\par \par \uc2 Wrongful sales practice behavior, in our retail banking business goes against everything regarding our core principles, our ethics and our culture. It runs counter to our vision of helping our customers succeed financially and it is not representative of Wells Fargo as an institution.\par \par \uc2 I'm here to discuss the situation today. Tell you about the actions we have taken, and our commitment on how to move forward. Our entire culture is centered on serving our customers, and in this case, we let our customers down.\par \par \uc2 Our retail banking practice issues -- its sale issues, are not a reflection of our hard working, intelligent team members, who deserve thanks for helping our customers with their financial needs. I want to make very clear, that we never directed nor wanted our team members to provide products and services to customers that they did not want.\par \par \uc2 That is not good for our customers and that is not good for our business. It is against everything we stand for as a company. That said, I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices in our retail banking business. And I am fully committed to fixing this issue, strengthening our culture and taking the necessary actions to restore our customer's trust. And Senators, let me tell you here today, the \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  board is actively engaged in this issue.\par \par \uc2 The board has the tools to hold senior management accountable, including me and \uc2 Carrie Tolstedt\uc2  , the former head of our retail banking business. Any board actions taken with our named executive officers, will be appropriately disclosed. And I want to be clear on this: I will respect and accept the decision of the board.\par \par \uc2 Under new leadership, we've already began taking steps to insure that the sales culture in our retail banking business, is wholly aligned with our customer's interests. On September 13th, 2016, we announced a major decision, that we will end product sales goals for everyone in our retail banking business. Because we want to make certain that nothing gets in the way of doing what is right by our customers. The new leadership team's primary mission, will be to provide the best possible service to our customers.\par \par \uc2 I'm also announcing, today, three new initiatives that will re- enforce our commitment to our customers.\par \par \uc2 First, we're expanding the scope over our account review and remediation, to include both 2009 and 2010.\par \par \uc2 Second, we will be contacting every single one of our deposit customers, across the country, using the same process that we agreed to with the city of Los Angeles, for our California customers.\par \par \uc2 And third, we have begun contacting hundreds of thousands of our customers with open credit cards, including those for whom we've already refunded fees to confirm whether they need or want their credit card.\par \par \uc2 In addition, we've recently started sending customers a confirmation e-mail with one hour -- within one hour of opening any new deposit account and an acknowledgement letter before submitting a credit card application. We recognize now, that we should have done more, sooner, to eliminate unethical conduct or incentives that may have unintentionally encouraged that conduct. We took many incremental steps, over the past five years in an attempt to address these situations. But we now know, those steps were not enough.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, a dedicated team began to engage in proactive monitoring of data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , specifically for the purpose of rooting out sales practice violations. In 2012, we began reducing sales goals that team members would need to qualify for incentive compensation. In 2013, we created a new corporate wide enterprise oversight for sales practices. In 2014, we further revised our incentives compensation plans, to align pay with ethical performance.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, we added more enhancements to our training materials, further lowered goals. And began a series of town hall meetings, to re-enforce the importance of ethical leadership and always putting our customers first.\par \par \uc2 Throughout this five-year period, we identified potential inappropriate sales practices. We investigated those and we took disciplinary actions that included terminations of managers and team members for sales policy violations, the 5,300 terminations over the five years that have been widely reported.\par \par \uc2 Despite all of these efforts, we did not get it right. We should have realized much sooner that the best way to solve the problems in the retail banking business was to completely eliminate retail bank product sales goals. And one of the areas that we missed was the possibility that a customer could be charged fees in connection with accounts opened without their authorization. Because deposit accounts that are not used are automatically closed, we assumed this could not happen.\par \par \uc2 We were wrong. And we took steps to refund fees that were charged and made changes to this could not happen again. In August 2015, we began working with a third-party consulting firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which conducted extensive large-scale data analysis of all 82 million accounts -- deposit accounts, and nearly 11 million credit card accounts that we had opened from 2011 through 2015.\par \par \uc2 Of the 93 million accounts reviewed, approximately two percent, 1.5 million deposit accounts and 565,000 consumer credit card accounts, were identified as accounts that may have been unauthorized. To be clear, PWC did not find these accounts had been unauthorized, but because it could not rule out the possibility, these accounts were further reviewed to determine if any fees had been charged.\par \par \uc2 PWC calculated that approximately 115,000 of these accounts had incurred $2.6 million of fees, which have been refunded to those customers. Even one unauthorized account is one too many. This type of activity has no place in our culture. We are committed to getting it right 100 percent of the time, and when we fall short we accept responsibility and we will do everything we can to make it right by our customers.\par \par \uc2 I will close by saying again, I am deeply sorry that we have not lived up to our values in this way. I also want to take this opportunity to thank our 268,000 team members who come to work every day to serve our customers. Today, I am making a personal commitment to rebuilding our customers' and investors' trust, the faith of our team members, and the confidence of the American people.\par \par \uc2 I'm happy now to address your questions.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Thank you, Mr. Stumpf.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf, according to your testimony, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  began making internal changes in 2011 to address the opening of unauthorized accounts. Did these problems start in 2011? Or could there have been unauthorized activity before then? Why 2011?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I think we all know that not every team member will do everything right every day of every minute. And we do a lot of training of our team members, coaching. They each sign an annual ethics statement. And I can't guarantee it did not happen before that time. We are trying to manage it within the business. And that's why I announced today that we're going back to 2010 and 2009. Because at that time, as you might recall, we were putting the \uc2 Wachovia\uc2  and \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  teams together, and we just thought we don't want to leave any stone unturned.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  fired approximately 5,300 employees in connection with these practices. What was -- what were the criteria for termination? And were any personnel actions taken short of termination? And if so, what were they? In other words, I'm sure you didn't fire everybody, but did you discipline some, and why, and so forth?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Correct. Yes, so Senator, thank you for that question, and it's a good one.\par \par \uc2 We have a number of triangulations around how to understand when there might be improper behavior. If some customer, for example, all of a sudden shows up with three savings accounts, they probably don't need that; or we have ethics lines, we have a culture in the company if you see something that you don't think is proper, raise your hand, talk to a manager.\par \par \uc2 So we looked at a number of situations, and some of them were perfectly legitimate. But for those who broke our trust, were dishonest, put customers at risk, we drew a very bright line. And after all, we are a regulated institution and we have a fidelity bond. And people who behave in this way simply can't work here.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Mr. Stumpf, your testimony also does not address when the violations were brought to the attention of senior management. Specifically, when did you find out that thousands of your employees were opening unauthorized accounts or fraudulent accounts? Did it take that long? When did you find out?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Thank you, again, Senator.\par \par \uc2 The business has their own audit and investigations and sales practices efficacy and so forth contained within the regional bank or the retail bank. After they had been working on this issue for a couple of years, and again this was way too many people, but it was one percent of our people. There's at any one time 100,000 team members in our banks.\par \par \uc2 And after notice -- after the business was dealing with this for a couple of years, it was then brought to the holding company and corporate assets, corporate audit, corporate compliance, the so-called second line of defense got very active. And that's when I became much more aware of the issue.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Does it bother you as the CEO of such a large bank that systemic fraud was not brought to your attention sooner by your employees?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: If I could turn the clock back, and I've thought about this a thousand times, of course I wish I would have done -- we all wish we would have done something more earlier. We didn't get on this fast enough. Again, recognizing that this was, you know, the vast majority of people were doing the right thing.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: When -- let's go back to the question of a minute ago. I don't believe you answered it specifically. When did the senior management, you and others you deemed senior management, learn about this fraud?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I can speak for myself, and I know that other corporate executives at the -- at the corporate area outside of the business, I can speak to myself, and I believe others, it was 2013. Before that, it was being dealt with with the audit and compliance within the business unit.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Mr. Stumpf, the board of directors of \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  has awarded the then-head of the community banking, \uc2 Carrie Tolstedt\uc2  , millions of dollars -- could be $100 million, as Senator Brown says, or more, in incentive compensation for, quote, "success in furthering the company's objective of cross-selling products," and quote, "reinforcing a strong risk culture," according to the 2015 proxy statement issued by your bank.\par \par \uc2 Explain to the American public today here what accountability at a large bank looks like when an executive departs with millions of dollars in compensation after thousands of employees defrauded customers? This question was raised by Senator Brown in his opening statement.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: OK. I'll try to get to all of those. And if I don't, please, but it's a good question. And Carrie Toldstedt as leader of the community banking business had a lot of requirements and things that -- that her performance was measured on -- putting the \uc2 Wachovia\uc2  and Wells business together; doing common branding; doing -- making sure customers were treated properly.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And throughout that entire period from 2011 until 2016, customer loyalty scores continued to improve. Today, they're top of class even by independent studies of large banks. Our team member engagement -- we do a study every year. And today, we have 15 people who are engaged in that business for every one that's disengaged. Balances and customers had grown.\par \par \uc2 Now, in this particular area, she did not do enough. We've been and -- and we decided that the chief operating officer that she was reporting to at the time, with my consultations, decided that we would go in a different direction.\par \par \uc2 But I also want to be clear, Carrie was eligible to retire when -- when she was told that we're going to go in a different direction. She chose to retire and she got no retirement severance benefits and -- and her compensation that she received in the past, some of it which is not -- which has been granted but not yet vested -- and other compensation will be considered by the board of directors in an independent process that they have. And I will respect and accept whatever decision they make.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Have they clawed back -- you have ability at the bank to claw back, do you not?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I'm -- I'm not an expert in compensation, but I will get you whatever...\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Are you the chairman? Are you the CEO of the company, right?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm the C...\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: And so you're -- are you the chairman of the board?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm the chairman of the board.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: OK. Then the...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: But I do not -- excuse me.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: And the buck stops here, so to speak?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It -- every -- it stops -- I'm the senior officer.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: So are you going to look into this seriously about what this person did, her responsibility, and the big reward that she's getting that happened under her watch?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, we will -- the board of directors, the compensation committee, and they'll refer to the board. I'm not part of that process. I want to make sure that beca -- that's a very independent process and nothing that I say would prejudice their deliberative process. But that is their decision, and they have all the tools available to them, whether she would have retired or she would have been fired.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Mr. Stumpf, is -- isn't a lot of banking based on integrity or trust by your customers in the bank itself?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I...\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: They do business with you, they put their money there, they -- they trust you. What's happened to the banking system? Not everywhere, but what has happened to the banking system?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, Senator, you think about it exactly the way I think about it. Trust is the core element of any relationship, and surely in the financial services business. And we know we have work to do in that area. And I intend to do all I can to help in that area.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Do you believe you violated that trust?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: There is no question with some of our customers we have violated trust, and we have to work hard to re-earn that.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Brown?\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf, I -- I'll make my questions short and ask you to be as concise as possible. Thank you. I -- to start with, your response to Senator Shelby, you made -- you became aware of the widespread fraud in 2013. Could you be more precise than that? When in 2013?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes. Well, I became aware that the problems the local business was working on in rooting out this behavior by one percent of our team members, give or take -- and I don't want to minimize that -- that we were not making enough progress.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: And when did you become aware more precisely?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, it was later in...\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Was it the L.A. Times article that you became -- that you...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes, later in 2013. Well, I had -- I had -- actually, I don't remember the exact timeframe. I can get back to you and staff. But it was sometime in 2013.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you for that. You suggest -- you mention that the \uc2 Wachovia\uc2  merger, that you're willing to go back before 2011, 2009, and \u8216\'20\'1810, in part because the Wacho -- \uc2 Wachovia\uc2  merger. The emphasis on cross-selling dates back at least to the \uc2 Norwest\uc2  merger, right? I mean this has been -- this has been a \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  business plan for a number of years. What year was the \uc2 Norwest\uc2  merger?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It was 2000 -- well it was announced -- you're talking about...\par \par \uc2 BROWN: The \uc2 Norwest\uc2  merger with Wells.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, that was 1998.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: OK. And so this, while \uc2 Wachovia\uc2  merger there clearly was some -- we are going back to 2009 and \u8216\'20\'1810, you're offering to do that. Why -- why -- why stop at 2009? We hear from people that it's gone on longer than that with the cross-selling, and the pressure, and the sales goals. Why are you only willing to go to 2009?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I -- Senator, I would tell you this. We want to make it right by any customer. And -- and -- we we're ready. We agreed with our regulators in our agreements to go back to 2011. We made a decision to go back to 2010 and \u8216\'20\'1809, and we want to make it right by any customer.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Does that mean you're willing to go back earlier than 2009?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I don't -- I can't tell you that today. I have to talk to our folks. I don't know about -- about records and so forth. But I want to make sure any customer who has had harm of any kind, that we will do right by them.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Well, you have records before 2009. Is that a pledge from you to go back earlier than that, if in fact there are customers that were harmed by unauthorized accounts.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, I will take that under advisement.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Yeah, well, I...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And I will get back to your (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 BROWN: If -- if you're -- if -- And I accept your good intentions that you're going back to 2009 to -- to give restitution to those, to provide restitution to those customers. But why stop there if you know that you say you have to go back and talk to staff? I mean if you're -- if you really do want to make sure these customers are made whole, you should go back as long as you possibly can.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And, Senator, I again -- I think that's a -- you know, we've considered that. I -- I will take that under advisement.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Well, I hope you more than consider it. Thank you. Talk about Senator Shelby's, Chairman Shelby's, discussion on the claw back. Understanding I think you minimize your influence. To us at least you minimize your influence over (ph) the board. You're the chairman of the board. Understand that the board goes through a process and I respect that. But you as the chairman, are you going to recommend to the board...\par \par \uc2 Oh, back up. You -- you -- you I would assume are more familiar with -- with both the pros and the cons of performance from -- from Miss Tolstedt. You were aware that -- that she is getting, she is slated to get some news reports say up to $120 million.\par \par \uc2 You're also aware that most of the 5,300 people, team members that were fired, were low-income workers, as well as eleven something an hour, maybe up to $16 or $17 an hour. But were generally low- income workers, low paid workers. So you're more familiar with that than probably any board member, at least as familiar.\par \par \uc2 So will you, with your knowledge, and your stature, and your position on the board make a recommendation to this board that they should clawback a significant amount of her compensation?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, I -- I'll answer that question. But I just want to put something in perspective.\par \par \uc2 The lowest paid worker we have, our entry level in our least cost area, is $12 an hour. Our lowest paid worker in our high cost area is $16.50 an hour. In addition to that, about $6 per hour is also -- that doesn't include the benefits around health care, which we pay virtually all of it for low paid people.\par \par \uc2 But most of the people who lost their jobs because they violated our code of ethics, they were dishonest, were not -- those were good paying jobs. We -- we -- people lost their jobs who were bankers, bank managers, managers or managers, and even an area president. These were good paying jobs, jobs that were -- the average is I think were in the, you know, $35,000 to $60,000 area, if you just want to take an average.\par \par \uc2 But with respect to your question specifically, I'm not on the human resources and compensation committee. That's an independent committee. And -- and they will take that under their deliberation. I don't want in any way to prejudice their activity, and I'm going to accept and -- and respect any decision that they make on -- on anything (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you for saying that. Are you -- so you are -- you are not willing to make a recommendation, based on the how this looks to the public, that -- call them good paying jobs at $16 or $17 an hour or not, compared to what, but put that aside. But whatever these workers were making, they were in the bottom some percentage of the work force.\par \par \uc2 Whatever, they -- they made mistakes, they were dishonest, they apparently deserved to be fired. I won't -- I won't dispute that. But I mean just -- you're not willing as a CEO of this bank to make a public recommendation that you think -- to make a public statement -- that you think Miss -- that -- I'm sorry, Miss Telfold (ph), Miss -- I'm sorry...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Tolstedt. BROWN: Tolstedt, \uc2 Carrie Tolstedt\uc2  . That sounds (ph) -- you're not willing to say publicly that to this committee or to anyone that -- that some of her compensation, over $100 million when she announced her retirement in the last several weeks, that any of it should be clawed back.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm going to let the process proceed, and the board's already met, and I made a -- affirmative (ph) comment in my -- in my testimony.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: OK. That's unfortunate. You said in your testimony in August, if August 2015, your words, we began working with PWC, unquote, to locate and reimburse customers who incurred fees. Was that your decision or were you directed to do so by the regulators?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That was in consultation with -- with regulators and with the city attorney's office.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: So, you did not on your own, after finding out in late 2013 of these problems -- you -- through the rest of 2013, month to three months of 2013, through all of 2014 and then into the first seven months of 2015, it never occurred to you that you should bring in somebody without the regulators suggesting it or pushing or in consultation. It never occurred to you to bring in somebody to really find out who was hurt, what kinds of issues were going on, how do we find these customers to reimburse them?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, that's a good question. I thought about that -- a lot about why. And it was -- it was early in 2015, about the time that we were considering or talking about who we would bring in that we finally connected a dot, and there's no excuse why we didn't connect it before.\par \par \uc2 What happens when an account is opened that is not funded, the system eliminates it within a couple of months. If it doesn't get funded, it's not used, it's not started, it's truncated (ph) or closed. It never dawned on us -- and again, no excuses and we were wrong. It never dawned that there could be a cycle, where a -- a cycle -- a 30-day cycle would have -- would have been (ph) completed and there could have been a fee associated with that. It was the first time that light bulb went on...\par \par \uc2 BROWN: I appreciate your candor about this, but I -- in 2011, 1,000 employees were fired; 2012, a similar number; 2013 was the peak number. 2014 -- 2013 was the L.A. Times article, 2015 throughout the year nothing happened. It seemed to never occur to management to any of this when I -- it's just -- and then today -- I don't question your integrity. But then today, you come in and make all of these announcements. It's been five years since -- at least five years since all of this has been happening.\par \par \uc2 Today, you make announcements that you're doing -- you apologize, we appreciate that. You make announcements you're doing the right things, we appreciate that. But it just -- it just sort of begs the issue of -- of where was management when these so many thousands of people were fired. Stories were written. Regulators were starting to come in.\par \par \uc2 I understand this a huge profit center for Wells, the retail banking writ large in terms of the unauthorized accounts and everything else. But it just doesn't seem quite right that -- that, it didn't occur to anyone on the board apparently or at least that had your ear (ph). Didn't occur to the CEO. Didn't occur to top management that they should do something more affirmatively until that August 2015 date when the regulators sort of helped you suggest and come to that conclusion.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Corker.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: Thank you Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf, thank you for being here. Just as an observation, I know that you have a whole host of people here with you and I'm sure one of those people is a communications person. I would just make the observation, look, I know you talk daily with board members, and you know, been on boards before myself.\par \par \uc2 I would suggest, just again as an observation, that to not invoke some degree of claw back for yourself and others involved would be committing malpractice from the standpoint of just public relations. So at a minimum, I'm sure that is going to take place. I would be surprised if it doesn't.\par \par \uc2 Let me just -- you found out about this through reading the L.A. Times is that correct?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: No, I don't recall back in \u8216\'20\'1813 exactly the time frame, but I learned about it later in 2013. Remember, the...\par \par \uc2 CORKER: But...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm sorry.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: So -- but it's sounds like it really was brought to your attention after a story in a newspaper. Well, that's when the focus really began. I'm not criticizing that, I'm just asking.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: No. And I -- only thing I want to make, Senator Corker, is that we had dismissed a number people, and that's what caused the L.A. Times...\par \par \uc2 CORKER: The story. So you all had taken some actions. They wrote a story and...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Exactly, yes.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: Your board -- you know, I know public boards today, you know, intense scrutiny, this all kind of committees that are set up. When did the board realize that you had a unit that was committing fraud? It seems to me that that's one of those things you flag pretty quickly or at least a committee of the board.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes. And -- and -- I just want to say, these team members, you're absolutely right. They did not do us right. It was...\par \par \uc2 CORKER: I -- I didn't ask that.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: OK...\par \par \uc2 CORKER: I'm asking you when the board became aware that you had a unit that was involved in committing fraud?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, it would have been later 2013 and then 2014 and on.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: So, they -- they weren't even aware of the L.A. Times story?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I -- I -- I think that was later in 2013. I'd have to go back and check my records. And it's to best of what I remember, but it was sometime later \u8216\'20\'1813, surely in \u8216\'20\'1814.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: I read a story about Ms. Tolstedt today. I don't know her. Actually sounds like she was an incredibly hard worker. Got to work early, rode a bus, you know, micromanaged, signed leases herself. I don't know if any of this was true.\par \par \uc2 But how do you -- when you have somebody that's that involved in sort of micro details, is this a case of not raising their head up to 5,000 or 10,000 feet and understanding the kind of culture that was being created by slogans like eight is great and those kinds of things?\par \par \uc2 I mean, it's just hard -- you know, it seems to me that within a bank with all the data you use to contact customers and -- I mean, you can, with algorithms, I mean you guys can pick this stuff up so quickly. It's hard to believe that there isn't some report within the bank that would cause -- cause this to jump out at people and say something really bad is happening here.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator Corker, I think that is -- that's a good question. And in a retail business, where you have 100,000 people in seats at any one time in our 6,200 branches, there is a lot of turnover. And I'm not justifying...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CORKER: But there's an officer, there's a compliance officer.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Absolutely.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: And -- and all banks have these. I mean, you all are regulated to death, and that's their job. And this kind of -- this is something that I -- you would think would be flagged and jump out at someone who was in that job.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I was -- and -- thank you, and that's what I was trying to explain. That, in her business, surely she was, I believe, reporting situations where there was ethical breakdowns and...\par \par \uc2 CORKER: But not to the board? STUMPF: And it -- it got to the board level -- it got to the corporate level in 2013 because progress was not being made. And the board level in \u8216\'20\'1814, as the corporate resources started to, and we've been actually seeing improvements since that time.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: It does seem like, just in fairness -- again, there does seem like a big disconnect there. So, she left after 27 years. And I think it would be good for the audience at some point, not during my time, to explain the entire compensation. I think it's a little different than most people think based on some of the comments that have been made.\par \par \uc2 But I assume her departure after 27 years was based on this issue. Is that correct?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It was based on a number of issues. This was one of them. We want to take the business in a different direction and we...\par \par \uc2 CORKER: So she, in essence, was terminated over this issue?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: No, Carrie chose to retire. Tim Sloane, our chief operating officer, with my consultation had discussion with her, and it was sometime in June or July, and said we want to go in a different direction. We want to put an end -- we want to put more focus on this issue. But it was a variety of things and she was eligible for retirement and she decided to retire.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: Well, my time is up, and out of respect for other members, I will stop. I have numbers of other questions. We thank you for being here.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Reed.\par \par \uc2 REED: Well, thank you very much Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 And thank you, Mr. Stumpf, for being here. Let me try to clarify a bit more your position going forward with respect to the issues of compensation. Not just Ms. Tolstedt, but even your own conversation. Will you formally recuse yourself from board deliberations?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I'm not even -- I'm not even involved in board discussions around what the HRC does with anything respect with me and/or as they recommend to the board. So there's no recusal required. But if -- but I'm happy to do that, but I'm not even involved with that.\par \par \uc2 REED: It will ultimately come up, though, to the board for a vote of affirmation of the compensation committee, correct?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It would and I'm not part of that. That's done in an executive session without me. It's always been done that way.\par \par \uc2 REED: All right. In 2013 when you learned of this, what did you do? This has been asked several different ways. Did you inform the regulators or instruct someone to inform the regulators of a growing problem?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Thank you, Mr. Reed. Yes. And I should have mentioned that earlier, but yes. The -- our primary and prudential regulator was informed at that time.\par \par \uc2 REED: Did you inform the board at that time?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes. I can't recall the exact meeting. And -- and -- but I can -- I can -- but it was sometime in \u8216\'20\'1813. And I know in 2014, various committees of the board were made aware of this. The risk committee, the audit and examination, the Corporate Responsibility.\par \par \uc2 REED: Did you take any steps to internally notify your employees of this type of behavior which going back was, you know 11,000 people are gone (ph), 12, 13, including an area manager. Did you communicate that or did you simply keep these discussions internal to the board?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I do a team member town hall every quarter, where I go to one of our various cities and there will be a couple thousand people in the audience and then we webcast that broadly across our company. And I you know typically talk about ethics and doing what's right for customers.\par \par \uc2 And in the case, the vast majority do it. But I was trying to really bring home this fact.\par \par \uc2 REED: But there -- there was given specific evidence of techniques used to essentially, the words of some of my colleagues and to defraud customers. Those specific practices were not focused upon and made very clear that they were not tolerated? Or it would seem to be a generic discussion of follow the rules.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Again, Senator Reed, at the time that the escalation happened in 2013, there were many different meetings and things happening. As I mentioned in my oral testimony, about reducing goals, talking about sales efficacy, having manager meetings, talking with leaders, putting more controls in place. And again, not fast enough, not far enough, and I apologize for that.\par \par \uc2 REED: Well, it seems that you know and I would suspect looking back, that the emphasis on meeting sales objectives, cross-selling was unremitting. And yet, you had examples here, specific examples of things that you knew were happening and should not be happening.\par \par \uc2 And yet, what I've -- what I'm hearing is more or less a generic make those sales oh, and by the way, you know, we have these ethical rules in place, too. Again, you know, I think you've said it and it's obvious that the tone, emphasis, what the leader does, what the leader says, is sometimes more important than anything else.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah. REED: For a period there, this was recognized but there was no specific stop, you know, stop this stuff.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I can tell you, we said stop this stuff. And -- and the thing about cross-sell is, I'd rather have a customer with two products that they use and they need and they want and they value than four products that are not used and valued. In the first case, customer wins, we win, we all do well.\par \par \uc2 In the second case, everybody loses. We lose money. It does not help us. So we've been -- we tried very hard. And again, we were not as effective as we could have been in talking about -- you know, the goal here is not, you know, products. The goal here is deep relationships. We had the wrong tool for too long to make that happen.\par \par \uc2 REED: A simply conclusion (ph) that it seems that it took too many -- too many months, years, literally, for some simple steps which should have been taken to be taken to be taken and it was only, I think, as a result of what ultimately Los Angeles County and the regulators and others did that forced the issue. Thank you, Mr. Stumpf.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Toomey?\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for calling this hearing.\par \par \uc2 I have to say, what we've been learning is so deeply disturbing at so many levels. First, we discover that \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  had a sales culture that was blatantly antithetical to what's best for customers. We discover that management had far too few common-sense controls in place to prevent the kind of abuse that customers were subject to.\par \par \uc2 We discover \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  executives completely out of touch. In a 2011 Forbes article, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  was rated the best at cross-selling its products. Only problem is, we discovered \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  wasn't always cross-selling, signing up customers for products when you know the customer doesn't want the product, failing to notify customers about these sham accounts -- and this isn't cross-selling, this is fraud.\par \par \uc2 That's what this is. And then we discover, way too little done to prevent it from continuing, even after it was discovered. So \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  employees continued for years, to literally forge customers' signatures, including my constituents, on documents to open up accounts.\par \par \uc2 And then the case of \uc2 Carrie Tolstedt\uc2  , my understanding is that something on the order of over $20 million in bonuses for her between 2010 and 2015, were awarded because of strong cross-sell ratios. Yet, we know in some cases, she was hitting numbers by these fraudulent accounts. So this is unbelievable. But let me -- let me begin, Mr. Stumpf, do you acknowledge that the employees who engaged in this activity were committing fraud?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I'm not a criminal, you know, officer and I don't know the -- the -- I'm not a lawyer, I don't know the legal term. I know this, they broke our code of ethics, they were dishonest and we did everything we can to support law enforcement, police...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: So I'm not a lawyer either, neither are most adults in America. But I think most people understand the meaning of the word fraud. Black's Laws Dictionary does provide a useful definition. It says fraud is, "A knowing misrepresentation or knowing concealment of a material fact made to induce another to act to his or her detriment."\par \par \uc2 How -- how does falsely signing a customer up for an account they don't want, how does it not meet that definition?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, and again, if that's the definition that -- you know, I can tell you this, it is absolutely wrong. We found this out. We got rid of those people and they have no place. That behavior has no place in our culture, if that means fraud that means fraud.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: At what point did you alert your regulators and law enforcement that you had probably criminal activity happening on a large scale?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, well, again, it was one percent of our people, senator. And I know that...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: But 5,000's a big number.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It's bigger than my hometown, I do know that. And it was -- but we also had the vast majority who did the right thing. But let's talk about those, every time --and we made a very bright line. If it happened one time it was one time, it was one time...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: I have only five minutes, here.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And to answer your question. I'm sorry, we sent it. We did everything we needed to do...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: Did you refer it to law enforcement?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: When it was -- when it was required, we did. We did everything according to the rules.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: When did you begin to disclose in SEC filings that you had this potentially material adverse set of circumstances that could certainly have huge damage to your reputational value?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I don't -- the -- I can't answer that; I'd have to get to our legal team. I don't have that in front of me. But this was not a -- I'd just have to get back to you on that. I don't know.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: Well, we haven't been able to discover such a disclosure and the SEC very clearly requires disclosure of material adverse circumstances. And I don't know how this could not be deemed material. I think the market cap lost nine percent over the last couple of weeks, that's pretty material.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, well, from a financial perspective, you know $2.6 million. And it's $2.6 million too much. And $185 million was not deemed...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: I get that those dollar amounts may not qualify as material to a bank the size of \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  but the reputational damage done to the bank clearly is material. And that has been manifested by this huge, adverse movement in stock prices.\par \par \uc2 Let me -- let me raise one other issue. You mentioned in your testimony and you state unequivocally that there are no orchestrated effort or scheme, as some have called it, by the company. But when thousands of people conduct the same kind of fraudulent activity, it's a stretch to believe that every one of them independently conjured up this idea of how they would commit this fraud.\par \par \uc2 Isn't it very probable that there was some orchestration that happened at some level, if not -- I'm not suggesting it was you personally, by any means. But doesn't it defy common sense to think that there wasn't some orchestration of this?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, I don't know how -- what motivated or why people did this, but we did fire managers and managers of managers and in the case, area president. So again, you know -- you know, this one percent is way too many. I don't want to minimize it, but I also want to make sure that we recognize that the vast majority of the people did exactly the things that we wanted them to do; to help customer relationships, help them succeed financially. And also, we have put a number of other controls in place besides taking sales goals off the table.\par \par \uc2 We now have, we don't open any deposit account today, or any credit card without a signature. And, well there's a couple cases were ADA, where they can't, we'll have a dual notice. We're also doing mystery shopping and we're also giving customer's a one hour notice by e-mail or then by an e-mail, by letter, to make sure exactly and they know exactly what they've opened.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: It -- it seems like it took an awfully long time, to impose those sort of basic controls. I see I'm out of time. Thank you Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Menendez.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Thank you Mr. Chairman. First of all, thanks for and in response, I know you said you were already on the way. But through a letter that we sent asking you for this hearing, so I appreciate you for holding it. Mr. Stumpf, let me just say, I'm personally appalled by the size, the scope, the duration, and the impact of the scandal. And I must say that I'm shocked and incredibly disappointed by the response of \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's corporate executives.\par \par \uc2 In the last week, you and your chief financial officer have taken to the press and laid the blame squarely on low paid, retail bank employees. And while I don't excuse what they did by any stretch of the imagination, I find that despicable. \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  touts to its investors and its customers that we will never put the stagecoach before the horses.\par \par \uc2 Well I'll tell you what, the bank recklessly rolled over 2 million of your customers, in what is, no way can be viewed as a -- other than a large scale scheme to boost, you know your growth, and whatever that meant for your shares, and whatever that meant to your shareholders. So, you didn't fire 10 employees right? You didn't fire 500 employees, you fired 5,300 employees is that right?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes, 5,300 that did not honor our culture. MENENDEZ: And they were not located in one branch of one district, is that right?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That is correct.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: They were located across the country. Is that fair to say?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That is fair to say.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Now, shouldn't the workplace actions of employees, reflect the values of the institution, no matter what part of the country that they're in?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I absolutely agree with that.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: So do you believe that senior executives, like yourself, are responsible for nurturing and honing a company wide culture for your employees and your employee's actions?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Absolutely.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: So this isn't the work of 5,300 bad apples. This is the work and the result of sowing seeds that rotted the entire orchard. And whether tacitly to sales guides and employee training manuals, some of which I've reviewed, or more explicitly through demands from hard driving managers. You and your senior executives created an environment in which this culture of deception and deceit thrive. And yet, you know, I see this as a toxic combination of low wages.\par \par \uc2 Now I know that in response to Senator Brown's question as what is an average banker at Wells Fargo made, you said between $30,000 and $60,000, you said that's good money. How much money did you make last year?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: $19.3 million.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Now that's good money. Now that's good money. Is it a combination of low wages, punishing sales quotas and a grossly misaligned compensation incentive throughout the bank's organizational structure. As is evidence that you've removed it. Now, when you were holding these ethics sessions, did you ever specifically, seeing this information, begin to blip up on your radar screen and then more insignificantly, did you ever specifically say, in those sessions, we do not want to open accounts for our customers that they don't ask for? Did you specifically say that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, I will get to that question. But I just want to go back for a second. When a team member that opens an account that's not used, that does not help customer and does not help us. And the vast majority did the absolute right thing.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Did you specifically say...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And I specifically said, yes, we do not push products. We sit down with a customer. We have a needs base analysis. And based on what we hear, where the customer is on their actual journey.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Did you specifically say, that in fact, I don't want to see accounts opened for customers that they did not ask for?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Absolutely.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: When did you say that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I've said that many times, in many town halls.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Let me ask you. Ms. Tolstedt made about $9 million in salary, did she not last year?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes. It's in the, it's in our public...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: You made about $1.1 million in salary, bonus and stock awards. The average -- according to Glass Door -- the average Wells Fargo banker teller salary is $24,545 and the average salary for a Wells Fargo personal banker is $37,560. So imagine, do you know what the, what the poverty wage is for a family of three?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I do not have that with me.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Well, let me just share that with you. I didn't think you would. It's $24,300. For a family of three, it's $20,160. So imagine for a moment. You're a single parent working with two young children as a personal banker in \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's branch. Let's say your base salary is somewhere in the $30,000 range. You have a hard driving boss, breathing down your neck, to meet rigorous sales quotas.\par \par \uc2 You've got to call in to a call center when you don't meet those quotas and if you don't meet the quota one day, it gets carried over to the next day. So you've got even a higher quota. And you're being told, forget about the incentive of making more money, in essence this is about losing your job.\par \par \uc2 And you think that that environment was the appropriate environment to protect your customers? And to have the culture that you portray here that \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  had?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator Menendez, I get your question. We have been reducing sales goals and bringing other goals into place. Even before we decided to get rid of the sales product goals. And the vast majority -- the vast majority loved, you know, loved \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  . In fact, when we go to our regional banking, our retail banking people, 15 of our people in survey, it's actually a census done by Gallop, every year, loved the environment in \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  . And they put customers first. I can't excuse the behavior of the 1,000, I know it's too many. But the culture is a very caring and collaborative culture.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Well, let me just, I know that my time is up. But let me just ask you a final question before, hopefully the chairman will have a second round. Did you or any senior executive at Wells Fargo suffer any financial consequence as a result of what's transpired over the years? STUMPF: The board will take. Well, first of all...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: To date. Have you suffered any financial consequences?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: The board has gone through and yes people have been held accountable.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Senior executive financially?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senior executive...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: I'd like you to classify for me what that is?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: OK. People that are in charge of risk, in the retail bank. People who are in charge of sales efficacy. Regional presidents who don't meet their goals around -- proper sales. Yes. People are held accountable and they will be held accountable.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Heller.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing and for our witness for being here today. I appreciate it. For years, the people of Nevada have struggled to regain what they lost in the aftermath of the housing crisis. And we all know that this housing crisis was caused by greed and excess.\par \par \uc2 And for too long, Nevada often has had the unfortunate distinction of having one of the highest rates of unemployment, foreclosures, underwater homes, homes sold in short sales, and personal bankruptcies. So trust, to me is the center point of any relationship with a business. And I assume it's the same that \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  has broken that trust.\par \par \uc2 I consistently fight to insure Nevadans retain the protections of their personal privacy. So I was shocked to hear the reports. Mr. Chairman, the employees of \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  opened millions of bank accounts and credit cards without customer's consent. The actions of some \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  employees directly took money from American's pockets, in order to artificially inflate company quotas.\par \par \uc2 I had a constituent and I've had number of constituents call my office. This one happened to be from Henderson, Nevada. E-mailed me and says, she was affected by \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's tactics. She said she was insulted, that leadership at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  was unaware of these policies.\par \par \uc2 And given the culture of wrongdoing that some of your employees exhibited, taking responsibilities, refunding customers and conducting internal investigations should only be the first step. As we plan to fix this mess. Accountability to perform and putting your customer's interests first should be \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's top priority. And so with that, Mr. Stumpf, just a couple of questions.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Do my constituents have a right to be insulted? I've heard a number of comments. Probably more directed at you, that you take the Sergeant Shultz position. That you knew nothing as this was moving ahead. But perhaps you even took -- and I heard this from one of my constituents -- the Hillary Clinton approach, what difference does it make attitude. And let me tell you why they're talking this.\par \par \uc2 About your -- your letter to your valued customers since you tried to explain to them some of the problems that, you may have seen news recently that some \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  customers received products and services that they did not need. You didn't tell them you were sorry, in your customer service letter. You came to this committee and told us you were sorry, but you didn't tell your customers you were sorry.\par \par \uc2 Do they have a right to be insulted?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, first of all, let me tell you, every -- I had a number of media contacts last week, one broadcast, and four in -- in print. And I am sorry, I am accountable when we don't it right 100 percent of the time. And I was even -- I was I think misquoted or misunderstood in one where I -- I blamed team members. I don't like -- we don't accept behavior that's not consistent with our culture, but I do accept responsibility and I am sorry.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: This letter appears that you're downplaying some of the concerns and you said that some \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  customers, well, you know, we're talking almost two million accounts that were opened up. Let me ask you this question. Were -- was anybody on your board or yourself, did -- did any of you have any opened unauthorized accounts in your names?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I don't know that. I've not seen a letter, you know, on mine. And I was not -- and I was not refunded any of the dollars.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: What would you have done if you had an unauthorized account where somebody forged your own name? What would you have done about that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I've had that before where people have...\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Your bank, in your bank.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: ... forged or stolen my identity.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Yes. STUMPF: But of course I would be -- I would be very disappointed, and I can surely understand your constituents' disappointment, and we have a lot of work. Nevada is a wonderful, important state to us. We've been there a long time. And -- and I apologize to all of the American people and our customers, and we'll make it right.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Can I go back to Carrier Tolstedt for a moment? You said you're not on the compensation board. But if the compensation board were to send you a recommendation to approve $100 million as a compensation package for her, would you support that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I -- I'm not on that board. And I think it's probably maybe -- if I could just take a second. As I understand, and -- and I'll get you the information about her $100 million. It's -- part of it is stock she has either purchased in the open market or exercised and owns for her 27-year career. There're -- there are some dollars that are in the money options that she's not yet exercised, and then finally there is a part of -- of a future grants that will be vesting over the number -- a few number of years. And the board will consider all of those things. They'll consider her entire situation in their deliberations.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Would you app -- would you approve that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I -- again, Senator, I'd want to be respectful of the committee and respectful of their process, and not any way bias their decision.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Mr. Chairman, my time's run out. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Tester.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Brown, for having this hearing. I've been on this committee for nearly 10 years now. You have done something that has never happened in the last 10 years, and united this committee on a major topic, and not in a good way.\par \par \uc2 Credit card accounts were opened. Folks didn't know about them. There were fees charged, potentially fines charged. And if customers were aware that -- unaware that there accounts were opened up, there must have been many instances -- there were two million accounts opened up -- that negative information was sent to credit bureaus.\par \par \uc2 Is that accurate?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: The part that's accurate is there's 565,000 credit cards that were opened up that were never activated. About 400,000 of those have customers' signatures on them, and 5.7 percent or -- less than six percent of those accounts that we opened at that time were not activated, which is a pretty standard industry -- because people might have them -- we're going to go back to each one of those customers now and find out if that was a legitimate signature and opened. And, if it's not, we'll make it right. TESTER: OK, but that's not what I asked. I asked was negative information turned into the credit -- bureaus because of these actions.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I -- I don't know the algorithms of how credit bureaus...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: But this...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: But -- but I want to answer your question. I -- I -- I know that when a credit bureau is requested, it has a impact on your credit score.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Well, this is a big deal.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes, it is.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: And I'm telling you it is a big deal. I could ask you for the -- age breakdown on this, these two million accounts that were opened up. But I am telling you that, if information was sent into the credit bureaus because of these falsely opened accounts, the impacts on this are far,, far more than the -- than the fees or fines that could be associated with that.\par \par \uc2 What is \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  doing about that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, Senator...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Or did that information not get reported to the credit bureaus?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, when we pull a credit...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Just -- just ask me. Just tell me. Did the information, if there was fees and fines involved, and the credit bureaus requested, or even if they didn't, did that information get forwarded to the credit bureaus?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I -- I'm trying -- sir, I'm trying to work with you. I -- I'm...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: But a yes or no works.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes, we -- we pulled a credit bureau for each one of these cards.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: OK. So what's Wells doing about fixing that problem, and be concise.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We are calling each credit card customer to find out if this truly was a card that they wanted.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: OK.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: If they want it, we don't want to take away their credit. If they did not want it, we're going to go back and make sure that it's made right by the credit bureau, and made right by the customer.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: And what's the timeframe for that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We already started that process.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: OK. So now this took five years. It's been documented, 2011, maybe even started before that. But 2011 till fairly recently. Now, if I had had a credit card issued in the first volley, and in the meantime, between 2011 and now, I decided to buy a house and that information was reported to the credit bureau, it could make -- you probably could know the figure -- but maybe half a percent, maybe more than that. And on a $500,000 mortgage, the difference between three and a half and four percent if 50 grand over 30 years.\par \par \uc2 What's being done about that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We will look at each one of those and determine what...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: So you're going to go back in and find out, even if they didn't do business through Wells, if they bought a house and what Wells did impacted their credit rating, you're going to go back and find those folks?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm going to go back. We -- we've committed to go back to all of our credit card customers and find out...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: What about the ones that got -- you've refund all their fines, you've refund all their fees, you went back to credit bureau and reestablished their credit rating as of today, what about the folks that may have bought a house through Chase and got a higher interest rate because of it?\par \par \uc2 How are you going to find those folks?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, we're -- we're working on that. I told our people go back and make it right. And I can -- I can, as we start going through that, I'm happy to have our team come back and report to you how we're working on it.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Well, I think it's really important that you understand that it's -- it's -- this is a big deal. I mean it's a big deal. And I know you feel bad about it. We feel bad about it. But the truth is there's real world implications here on young families on old families that are going to be put into a poverty situation because of this, even though we think it's just a few hundred bucks in fees. It's more than that, much more than that.\par \par \uc2 So you found out in 2013, and I don't want to beat this horse any more, but did you find out that they were actually setting up accounts with fraudulent signatures in 2013?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I learned that some of our team members were not doing the right thing and they were opening accounts on customers, and then we truncated them.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Because it would seem to me that, if you guys knew about that, a simple edict would have been pretty helpful. Don't do this, if you do this, you're gone.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And that's -- we had even more than that. And -- and what we should have done is get rid of our incentive program.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: But the last thing, and this is a statement, it's not. But I can tell you that you've said multiple times here that 5,300 people went, and that's basically one percent of your workforce. Every time you say that, you give ammunition to the folks who want to break up the big banks.\par \par \uc2 5,300 people are more people are more people than live in most towns in Montana. 2 million people is twice the population of the entire states. This is a major screw up that went on for far, far, far, far too long. And I think you know that. But, man, there's going to be a lot of work that has to be done to rectify this situation, if it ever can be rectified.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Crapo.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 And, Mr. Stumpf, I want to follow up on the line of questioning that Senator Tester was just discussing with you. But first I want to ask a couple of questions about just data basically. Consumers expect that their private information is going to be protected at their bank and not used to open an unauthorized account. You've gone through that extensively today.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: Did the third-party analysis that you engaged in determine if these unauthorized accounts were created uniformly across the United States? Or were there areas in the United States where they were more heavily created?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes there was a more heavily bias towards the Southwestern part of the country.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: The information I have indicates that that, even more specifically includes California and Arizona. Would that be correct?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That would be correct.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: I also have New Jersey here on my list. Was New Jersey more heavily impacted?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well I have numbers by state and it typically related to, there were some, over indexed, over, people did more wrong things. But it more associated with the size of the business we're a much larger bank in Southern California and Arizona, New Jersey. There are places where we're larger and it fit more the pattern of the size of our organization in those communities.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: So because of that, it wasn't necessarily that the management in those communities were potentially the ones who were driving this more aggressively, but simply the size of your business in those communities?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator it was a bit of both.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: All right thank you. Obviously one of the questions that my constituents and constituents across the country have is am I one of those who has had an unauthorized account created in my name? And you've indicated that right now \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  is calling every customer, is that correct?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We are contacting all of our deposit customers. And the credit, and incidentally virtually all of these accounts came on the books and were closed within a 60-day period. And so there's of the potential again, the 2 million accounts we, that could not be eliminated, I think I said that in oral testimony, so I don't know you know, we just couldn't eliminate them, or PWC could not.\par \par \uc2 But we're calling all of our credit card customers and contacting all of our deposit customers and we have a special call a number. We're asking people to come into our banks and talk to our people... CRAPO: That was my next question. If there's somebody who doesn't want to wait for the call, what can they do?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I mean they're going to get a notice and say you know, if you have an interest you can e-mail us, we'll call you, we'll do whatever it takes to make sure that, and I know our study was quite, PWC was very comprehensive. We tried to err on the side of the customer.\par \par \uc2 In fact we're getting people come into our bank today saying, I got a $25 check but I wanted this service. And I'm not saying that, I'm just saying that we want to make sure that we don't hurt any customer and that if they wanted credit they have it. If they didn't want it, we'll try to make it right by them.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: All right now getting back to Senator Tester's question about the credit impact. The simple opening of an account causes an impact to a credit rating doesn't it?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It does on, and again I'm not an expert in this field, but I know on the credit card side we pull a bureau. And depending on how many bureau, well I know that, that is a strike against, it lowers your credit score depending on how many requests are in that time. There's also a positive impact and I'm not here to justify or under, we will do what's right to make that right.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: Well and that's what I wanted to get at, finally in the last minute I have in my questioning. You said to Senator Tester and you just said again to me, that you're going to make it right. How do you do that?\par \par \uc2 For example, you said the calls have been being made. I assume that in the calls that the bank is making that they are finding customers, some, who have unauthorized and unwanted credit card accounts. How do you make it right with regard to the impact that that and potentially charges on that account have caused to the credit rating of that cardholder?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And Senator that is a very good question. We're just starting that process. I don't have enough to give you right now. But we'd be happy to come back to the committee and tell you more about what we learn as we do that.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: All right thank you. In the little bit of time I have left I want to shift topics. My understanding is that the primary regulators that you have been dealing with are the City of Los Angeles and the OCC and the CFPB. Is that correct?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That is correct.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: Could you just give me a timeline? When did each of those notify you? Or did you notify them at some point? In what order did they get involved and when?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I don't know that I have precise dates. But I'll give you a general timeline. The City of LA lawsuit was sometime in the May timeframe of 2015, well I, \u8216\'20\'1813 maybe it was.\par \par \uc2 I'm sorry I'm missing on dates here. And then the OCC was involved, we shared with them and when we learned of their lawsuit, we, well it was actually in \u8216\'20\'1815 I'm sorry, 2015, May of \u8216\'20\'1815. And then we shared that information with the CFPB. But the OCC was involved with us prior to probably the 2013 timeframe.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: So the OCC probably would have been involved first even before the City of Los Angeles?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: They are our principle regulator and yes.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: All right and then the CFPB would have been the final entity that was the last entity?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We noticed we called them -- someone from our legal department called them I believe in the May timeframe of 2015.\par \par \uc2 CRAPO: All right I'm sorry I see my time is well over now. Thank you Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Warren?\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Thanks Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf the Wells Fargo Vision and Values Statement which you frequently cite says "We believe in values lived not phrases memorized. If you want to find out how strong a company's ethics are, don't listen to what its people say watch what they do." So let's do that.\par \par \uc2 Since this massive year's long scam came to light, you have said repeatedly, "I am accountable." But what have you actually done to hold yourself accountable? Have you resigned as CEO or Chairman of Wells Fargo?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: The board, I serve at the...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Have you resigned?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: No I've not.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: All right. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well first of all this was by 1 percent of our people...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: That's not my question...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And, and...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: My question, it's about responsibility. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: The board will take care of that.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Have you returned one nickel of the money you earned while this scam was going on?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And the board will do...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: I will take that as a no then. Have you fired a single senior executive? And by that I don't mean a regional manager or branch manager. I'm asking about the people who actually led your community banking division or your compliance division?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We've made a change in our regional, to lead our regional bank.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: I just said, I'm not asking about regional managers, I'm not asking about branch managers, I'm asking if you have fired senior management. The people you actually led community banking division, who oversaw this fraud, or the compliance division that was in charge of making sure that the bank complied with the law?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: \uc2 Carrie Tolstedt\uc2  ...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Did you fire any of those people?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: No.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: No. OK. So you haven't resigned. You haven't returned a single nickel of your personal earnings. You haven't fired a single senior executive. Instead evidently your definition of accountable is to push the blame to your low level employees who don't have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves.\par \par \uc2 It's gutless leadership. In your time as Chairman and CEO Wells has been famous for cross-selling which is pushing existing customers to open more accounts. Cross-selling is one of the main reasons that Wells has become the most valuable bank in the world. Wells measures cross-selling by the number of different accounts a customer has with Wells.\par \par \uc2 Other big banks average fewer than three accounts per customer. But you set the target at eight accounts. Every customer of Wells should have eight accounts with the bank. And that's not because you ran the numbers and found that the average customer needed eight banking accounts. It is because "8 rhymes with great." This was your rationale right there in your 2010 Annual Report.\par \par \uc2 Cross-selling isn't about helping customers get what they need. If it was, you wouldn't have to squeeze your employees so hard to make it happen. No, cross-selling is all about pumping up Wells' stock price isn't it?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: No. Cross-selling is shorthand for deepening relationships. We -- what we do well...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Whoa, let me stop you right there. You say no? No?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I -- I...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Here are the transcripts of 12 quarterly earnings calls that you participated in from 2012 to 2014, the 3 full years in which we know this scam was going on. I'd like to submit them for the record, if I may, Mr. Chair. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 These are calls where you personally, made your pitch to investors and analysts about why \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  is a great investment. And in all 12 of these calls, you personally cited \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  's success at cross-selling retail accounts as one of the main reasons to buy more stock in the company.\par \par \uc2 Let me read you a few quotes that you had. April 2012, quote, "We grew our retail banking cross-sell ratio to a record, 5.98 products per household." A year later, April 2013, quote, "We achieved record retail banking cross-sell of 6.1 products per household." April 2014, quote, "We achieved record retail banking cross-sell of 6.17 products per household."\par \par \uc2 The ratio kept going up and up. And it didn't matter whether customers used those accounts or not. And guess what? Wall Street loved it. Here, is just a sample of the reports from top analysts in those years, all recommending that people buy \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  stock in part because of the strong cross-sell numbers.\par \par \uc2 And I'd like to submit them for the record.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Without objections.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Thank you, Mr. Chair.\par \par \uc2 So when investors saw good cross-sell numbers -- they did, while this scam was going on -- that was very good for you personally, wasn't it, Mr. Stumpf? Do you know how much money, how much value your stock holdings in \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  gained while they scam was under way?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, first of all, it was not a scam. And cross-sell is a way of deepening relationships. When customers...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: We've been through this, Mr. Stumpf. I asked you a very simple question. Do you know how much the value of your stock went up while this scam was going on? STUMPF: It's all of my compensation is in our public stock...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Do you know how much it was?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It's all in the public filing.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: You're right, it is all in the public records because I looked it up. While this scam was going on, you personally held an average of 6.75 million shares of Wells Stock. The share price during this time period went up by about $30 which comes out to more than $200 million in gains all for you personally.\par \par \uc2 And thanks, in part, to those cross-sell numbers that you talked about on every one of those calls. You know, here's what really gets me about this, Mr. Stumpf. If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the crash drawer, they'd probably be looking at criminal charges for theft.\par \par \uc2 They could end up in prison. But you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket. And when it all blew up, you kept your job, you kept your multimillion dollar bonuses and you went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross- sell quotas that made you rich.\par \par \uc2 This is about accountability. You should resign. You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 This just isn't right. A cashier who steals a handful of $20s is held accountable, but Wall Street executives who almost never hold themselves accountable, not now and not in 2008 when they crushed the worldwide economy. The only way that Wall Street will change, is if executives face jail time when they preside over massive frauds.\par \par \uc2 We need tough, new laws to hold corporate executives personally accountable and we need tough prosecutors who have the courage to go after people at the top. Until then, it will be business as usual. And at giant banks like \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  , that seems to be cheating as many customers, investors and employees as they possibly can. \u8216\'20\'18 Thank You, Mr. Chair.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Vitter?\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Mr. Stumpf, what astounds so many Americans and virtually all of us is how significant this fraud was, how widespread it was, for how long a period of time. And related to that, I'm very concerned about this timeline of when top corporate leadership like yourself knew about it.\par \par \uc2 You have been talking, in general, about 2013. Is that when the issue was a focus of board discussions, or was that the first time you knew of fraudulent activity and these unwanted accounts being opened against customers' wills?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: As I -- thank you, Senator Vitter -- as I testified before, this -- people in our regional bank, knew that not every team member would do everything right every day and they tried to root it out at the business level with their compliance and so forth. And once...\par \par \uc2 VITTER: When did you and folks at your level, like board members, know of this activity on any significant scale? Was it 2013, which you have suggested, or was it earlier?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: 2013.\par \par \uc2 VITTER: OK so in 2011, about 1,000 employees were fired over this. That's about one percent of the whole retail business. So one percent of a whole, big part of your business was fired over fraud and you were never told about that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That was -- that was dealt with in the business unit at that time.\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Is it normal for one percent of a business unit to be fired over fraud, not high turnover, not incompetence, fraud and this never is mentioned to you?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, in a -- in a large retail business that has other turnovers and so forth, if I could go back, I would have, you know, spent more time on this.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Why isn't this crystal-clear proof that an entity as big as Wells is not only too big to fail but it's too big to manage and it's too big to regulate? One percent of a big part of your business is fired over fraud but that doesn't rise to your level?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah and senator, that's a good question and I've thought about that. This was a problem of focus and not of size. Today...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Let's talk about corporate culture. You've often referred to people not living up to the Wells culture. Culture is not something written in a handbook. Culture, as has been suggested, is an atmosphere and what is lived.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I agree.\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Wasn't this practice, in fact, by the numbers part of the Wells culture by definition because it was so widespread for so long a period of time?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I think this is not part of our culture. This was the -- and again, it's a large number, but I -- the vast majority of our people do it right every day and they provide great value and they live according to our culture and vision of values.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 VITTER: And it's been a widespread practice for many years. I'll just make a statement, that makes it part of the culture, in my opinion. So it seems to me your challenge is to change the culture, not to enforce the culture.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well...\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Finally, what level of confidence, from zero percent to 100 percent, do you have that this type of fraudulent activity does not exist in other wells business lines?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, I -- we've looked at other things, other businesses. They're -- they're different and I --- we believe that this is situate in our regional bank. Other areas have different levels of compliance and different volumes and different requirements.\par \par \uc2 But we've looked across a number of things and I have confidence that we have this one now solved and we've made a lot of changes.\par \par \uc2 VITTER: So just as an example, Wells is the biggest participant in the SBA's 7(a) Loan Program. I happen to chair the Small Business Committee, so I'm focused on a lot of small business issues. Are you 100 percent confident that no fraudulent activity like this or no extreme quotas and goals exist in that 7(a) program?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah we don't have product goals to my knowledge in any -- any -- on one of our other businesses and we have, of course because of this situation, we've doubled down on compliance and review in a lot of our businesses across the board.\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Well, I'm -- I'm writing several of those compliance folks to urge a look at anything small business related, including the 7(a) program since Wells is the leader in that activity.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Sure.\par \par \uc2 Senator Donnelly?\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf, you had previously talked to me about \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  values. Look at the mess we are in.\par \par \uc2 A community banker from my state called the office unsolicited, and just sick. And he said, here we go again, where my bank is -- and a local community bank -- my bank is going to be slandered because of what these guys are doing.\par \par \uc2 And he said, if my bank had a widespread practice of opening unauthorized accounts and moving customer money without permission, I would be in jail, my bank would be sold, and my entire management team and board would be sued by the regulators for a lack of oversight.\par \par \uc2 And he is sick to his stomach about what has happened here. And so am I. Over 5,000 people from Indiana, 5,000 Hoosiers who, every day, as everybody has talked about from their own states, every day these people work nonstop to try to pay the bills, take care of their family, make sure that they can make ends meet, and they hope that they can.\par \par \uc2 Over 2 million-plus across the country. But over 5,000 Hoosiers who had unauthorized accounts opened. Now, the second many of these credit cards are opened, these folks' credit was immediately dinged. And this is something Senator Tester was talking about.\par \par \uc2 Then you go to take out a mortgage and you've got a 30-year mortgage that's at half a point or a point higher because your credit rating has gone down. So, what I want to know is, one of these things, is will you pay back every single extra dime that these people are going to incur over the 30 years because of the fraudulent action of the people at Wells?\par \par \uc2 It wasn't Sam or Judy who works at the mill, who was hoping to get a payment that they could afford. It was that their account had fraud committed to it, and now they have to pay more every single month for the next 30 years. How do you pay that back?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah. Thank you, Senator. We've been thinking about that. We're starting to call, make those calls to our constituents and find out, our customers. And I don't have a final answer for you, but we will -- our intention is to make it right by every customer.\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: So, do you promise to pay back every single extra dollar these people are going to incur over the next 30 years?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, Senator, I want to work with you and I'm trying to be cooperative. I just don't have all those answers for you today. But I surely get the issue. And my instructions have been to make it right by every customer.\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: One of the things that rubs everybody wrong around here, but not just here, around the country -- Americans are fair people. And everybody in this country tries to make sure that there's a square deal done. It's not a square deal when the people that are fired are the tellers who make 15 bucks, and the senior execs walk off with $100 million.\par \par \uc2 Americans can smell an unfair deal a mile away. And when this teller -- these 5,300 tellers, they didn't come up with this scheme on their own. This is the only way they could keep their jobs because of what was going on. And you called them dishonest.\par \par \uc2 And my question is, was \uc2 Carrie Tolstedt\uc2  , the head of all this, is she dishonest? And how do you fire someone making 15 bucks and not the person -- that's like firing the guy throwing coal in the engine and letting the captain go strolling off to $100 million new ship. How do you do that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I think that's an important question. First of all, most of the people were bankers who were not making $15 an hour, managers of those and managers of those. And there is something very different about violating our code of ethics and putting customers at risk and being dishonest versus someone who did not spend enough time making sure that this issue had been closed. I see a very big difference there.\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: Well, I think one of the things that the American people are just disgusted about is it seems like it all flows downhill. And the people down the hill get fired, don't even know if they can then pay their mortgage because of the job they had, they're gone, and that the people up on the top of the hill make $20 million, $10 million.\par \par \uc2 You know, the fellas who started the \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  , stagecoach, this was not their plan. This is not what we do. And the only last question I have, and I apologize, Mr. Chairman, but it's this -- for five years! Five years! And so, when folks say this too big to fail, for five years you were not able to end this.\par \par \uc2 And you look and you go, for five years, Americans were taken advantage of and were cheated, had their credit ratings ruined, had accounts opened that they never even knew about, and this bank -- either you didn't know or you knew and it was great for the story. You know, under any circumstance, none of the conclusions is good.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I couldn't agree with you more. We did not move fast enough. We should have done better. But I also may remind you that the vast majority of people also had families to feed and they did exactly the right thing. But we are sorry and we needed to do better. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 Good morning, Mr. Stumpf.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Good morning, Mr. Scott -- Senator Scott.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: I'll tell you, as a senator, I am frustrated, angry, and really unhappy with what appears to be a toxic culture in parts of your sales organization. As your customer, with two or three mortgages, a couple of accounts, I'm disappointed.\par \par \uc2 I'm disappointed in my financial institution that I've put so much confidence and trust in. I am, however, thankful for the real heroes that we've heard so little about this morning, the heroes, the employees who went to the press, the customers who went to the OCC, bringing oxygen to a very important conversation, and hopefully, resolution.\par \par \uc2 I ask myself, and perhaps Rita Morillo (ph) gives me the answer, why did not these employees find a safe haven up the chain? If you'll remember, I owned a couple of \uc2 Allstate Insurance\uc2  agencies, and so, the sales culture that was so toxic is also incredibly important for folks looking to support their families, who are working paycheck to paycheck.\par \par \uc2 And anyone who suggests that folks who make just a little money must cheat the system is an inconsistent suggestion. I know a lot of folks who are poor who would find that comment quite disrespectful. Lots and lots, most poor folks have strong integrity and would never put themselves in this situation.\par \par \uc2 I would suggest that perhaps the higher you go in that chain, in the sales organization, the more you find the problem, not the person making the 15 bucks an hour, to be honest with you. My question, though, is why was there not a safe haven? And have you created safe havens for employees who see things that are just running amuck?\par \par \uc2 Do they have a safe place to go? And not to "The L.A. Times," not to the OCC, but is there a culture that is being established -- I know you're limiting some of your sales goals, which have unintended consequences as well -- but is there a culture being established where the average employee feels empowered, encouraged to come forward and speak and be heard in \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  ?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator Scott, I really appreciate that line of questioning because it's absolutely -- and I should have mentioned it. Each team member, no matter where you are in the organization, is encouraged to raise their hand. If something is being asked of them that they think is not right, not consistent with our values and our culture, they're asked to raise their hand, they're asked to go to a manager's manager in HR.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We also have an anonymous ethics line. They can speak up and show us and talk to us about anything going on. We want to hear from them, because we don't want this behavior. And I wish, you know, we would not have this behavior, but we've also instituted some things today, you know -- and you mentioned getting rid of the sales goals -- but we also today have a -- have an e-mail we send within an hour of opening an account. No account gets -- can get opened today on a deposit side or a credit card without a signature.\par \par \uc2 And we're also doing a big mystery shopping program, by an independent third party to help tie it together.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: (inaudible) this is important for me to finish my line. Of course I'm glad to hear that you're making progress.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chairman, I would love for the record to have a better understanding of the culture of checks and balances that were not there that are now there that will help customers -- thousands of customers throughout South Carolina, have more confidence in all financial institutions. And perhaps having done it wrong you become a model for being -- doing it right.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: The second question I have, it goes back to the question we heard from Crapo, from Tester and so many others that -- and Donnelly, as well. That when you look at the impact on the consumer, the customer, you open an account -- I apologize now for going over my time for a minute or so. You have an account, I have a couple with the bank.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: I hope to keep them there.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Thank you, I -- we agree.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: I hope to keep them there.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: Someone opens an account, a fraudulent account. The definition of fraudulent -- God bless Black's dictionary -- if I didn't sign for it, it's fraudulent. I like to have simple definitions. So I open an account in my name. I don't know the account's open so there are fees attached to some of the accounts. The fees that are attached aren't paid because I'm ignorant of those accounts. Those fees that are not paid because I don't know about them, at some point is reported to a credit agency because I didn't pay the fees because, I didn't know about it because, I didn't open the account.\par \par \uc2 So when these fees that create a negative impact on my credit statement, it translates to higher interest rates or, said differently, a different way of exacting resources out of my very limited pocket. Especially for folks working paycheck to paycheck throughout South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Correct.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: So when that happens, it is nearly impossible for us to figure out the actual dollar amount -- as Senator Donnelly was looking for -- of impact on all the customers it goes through. And I would like for it also to be included in the questions for the record, some way of helping me and others understand how we create a solution for those customers who will obviously be identified by you or by a group of attorneys looking to sue.\par \par \uc2 So I would love to understand and appreciate that process so that I can go back to my constituents who I work for and give them a plausible path forward for actual resolution for those who are injured and a clear path forward for restoring confidence in financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 Because my fear, is that this is not going to simply be a Wells Fargo question, it will be a question for the entire financial footprint in our nation.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: And I -- I think it's a good point and I think -- and, again, I only did a check with our team but I think we've already gone back on the deposit side and made those fixes with the -- with the credit bureau and are working to rectify that. But I'll make sure we get back to you on -- on -- work with you on that issue.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: Thank you, sir.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Heitkamp?\par \par \uc2 HEITKAMP: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you for calling this meeting.\par \par \uc2 I know Mr. Stumpf there's probably many other places you'd rather be right now. But I think this is a critical time, as we look at the push that we've seen for financial institutions for lower regulatory burdens and trust us. What we've now lost has been trust, between not only you and your customers but between in a very bipartisan way -- between this committee and large financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 You have said repeatedly that one of your failures was that you did not act fast enough. Today, you're sitting in front of this committee and I'm telling you, you are still not acting fast enough. You still do not have the answers that we need to say that we're moving forward. And so let's start with remediation and by that, I mean repairing credit ratings, taking a look at refunds, taking a look at restoring the customer -- to the customer, what the customer lost.\par \par \uc2 You have said repeatedly to the folks here, you know, we're working on it, we're working on it. You know, we -- we start this story as far back as we don't know, but let's start at 11.\par \par \uc2 At 11, there's something going on and Wells Fargo is addressing it. At 13, there's something going on and Wells Fargo is addressing it. At 15, there's something going on and Wells Fargo is addressing it.\par \par \uc2 But yet, it didn't get done and now, you're coming to us and saying, trust us, we now get it. Now, we know. Now, we figured it out. And so we need a clear dialogue. But I think -- I think that one of the failures today is you haven't come with a whole lot of remediation, you haven't come with a whole lot of dialogue to us on, this is what we're doing to restore customer confidence.\par \par \uc2 And, like Senator Scott, I'm one of your customers. My whole family is. You aren't doing what you need to do to restore customer confidence but you're also not doing what you need do to restore confidence with this committee and with the American public.\par \par \uc2 I wanna talk about changing culture. There is no one on this committee who believes that 5,000 people independently act with impunity and with dishonesty. No one here believes that. And if they do, I've done law enforcement. This is -- this is -- this is a behavior that was created by the culture that was allowed.\par \par \uc2 Created by a whole lot of folks saying, you know, let's do it this way. This is not -- and I get what you're saying, that it wasn't just the tellers, its wasn't just the lower level. But yet the one person, the one person who was responsible directly, other than yourself, for making sure this doesn't happen isn't in front of this committee today.\par \par \uc2 In fact, she's walked off with a pretty good deal and hoping that all of this blows over. And the other thing, when you say you didn't act quickly enough, the board should have already acted to claw back those salaries. If you had come here and said, the board now is clawing back, these the things that we're doing and -- and -- you would be in a lot better position sitting in that chair right now.\par \par \uc2 And so I will tell you, you have not done enough to restore confidence today and this dialogue will continue with this committee and with the American public. Now, with that said, I wanna -- I wanna turn to the 5,000 people and I wanna -- wanna say maybe they deserve to have their reputation restored.\par \par \uc2 Maybe, they deserve to not be that person whose now resume says "fired" on a resume. Maybe, instead of just focusing on your customers, you ought to focus on the 5,000 people who I'm pretty sure did not unilaterally decide to be dishonest. And so it's an issue that hasn't been raised here.\par \par \uc2 But I think it's a critical issue because when you punish the guy at the end of the line and you don't punish in any way someone at the top, we end up with a -- we end up with a -- an attitude that, quite frankly, this is a corporate culture that doesn't care.\par \par \uc2 They're just trying to get through the day and I don't think that your day yet has ended and so I wanna thank you for appearing but it's not enough and it's not nearly what I had hoped you would come with today.\par \par \uc2 Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Moran?\par \par \uc2 MORAN: Mr. Chairman, thank you.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf, good morning.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Good morning.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: The -- as I understand the circumstances, the factual circumstances, many of the problems, while they were system-wide, many of the problems were focused in the Los Angeles area within your banking system, is that true?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It's true that that's the largest part of our business but they were also focused there, yes.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: And is -- have you analyzed sufficiently to determine what was different about Los Angeles than places elsewhere in your banking system that would suggest that the number of times, the volume of fraudulent acts that occurred there, how do you explain that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, as Senator Heitkamp said and if I did not share this, I wanna make sure -- I also agree 5,000 people don't just do 5,000 random things on their own. I'm sure there were people talking to one another within a branch and so forth but that analytical work is being done and has been done.\par \par \uc2 I don't happen to have it here, I'll have our team work with your staff to make sure that you have whatever you need on that.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: I would welcome that. I'm interested in knowing if you see this as a customer issue, a more vulnerable population of banking customers.\par \par \uc2 Or, as the word culture has been used here a number of times, was there something different about Los Angeles, which I assume -- again, I think illegal behavior, immoral behavior, breaking the rules is wrong wherever it happens, but our goal in management, your management of a financial institution, is to diminish the chances of that happening.\par \par \uc2 So you never condone bad behavior, but we want to make certain that the circumstances in which it is discouraged and never encouraged, and I don't have a feel for that circumstance. I don't know what really is the facts within the banking leadership that may have encouraged this behavior. We've seen this before.\par \par \uc2 I serve and a number of my colleagues, including Senator Brown, on the Veteran's Committee, where we saw the consequences of a system that rewarded appointments for veterans who needed medical care. We saw a scandal across the country in which veterans were put on a list suggesting they had an appointment; they didn't.\par \par \uc2 And the circumstances in which those individuals -- those individuals were listed as having an appointment, the allegation certainly exists that there was death as a result of the failure of the V.A. system to provide necessary health care.\par \par \uc2 (UNKNOWN): Correct.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: I think the point that Senator Heitkamp made I would make to you again.\par \par \uc2 There's a number of us on this committee and in Congress who work to try to find the right regulatory balance for financial institutions, and just to stress with you the importance of then having our financial institutions behave, their behavior, conduct be a certain level; otherwise, it undermines the efforts for that attempt to change the regulatory environment for financial success and we particularly focus that on community banks, but we care about those financial institutions that have a relationship with their customers.\par \par \uc2 And one of the arguments that has been made is those relationship bankers can rely upon the relationship. And what we're hearing from the circumstance that we find at Wells Fargo is that relationship was taken advantage of. It didn't accrue to the benefit of the customer. STUMPF: And, Senator, you are right for that portion. And what hurts so much is that we spend so much time trying to do the right thing and when a customer gets a product that's not used or not benefiting them, that hurts them and it hurts us. We have no interest -- and if I could just take one second.\par \par \uc2 I want to correct, Mr. Chairman, or share something that I wasn't as clear on.\par \par \uc2 On deposit account fees, none of those were reported to credit bureaus. So the credit bureau impact relates exclusively to credit cards and we're going to run each one of those down.\par \par \uc2 (UNKNOWN): Thank you.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: Mr. Stumpf, let me ask a final question. So I don't think you provided us with a precise timeframe in which regulators were notified, but I'd be interested in knowing what regulators were notified, when, who, and what steps they then took as regulators in response to the information they had.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: OK. And again, my recollection is that our prudential regulator, the OCC, was involved and notified and active in the 2013 timeframe. At about the time of the lawsuit from the City of Los Angeles, we informed the CFPB. And so I can tell you what we did. And I know you have a panel later with them, but that's what my recollection is.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: None of these actions at Wells Fargo came to light as a result of the regulators finding that behavior. It was reported to them subsequent. Is that true?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Again, I want to be -- I don't want to speak for them and I don't know what part of this is confidential supervisory information, but my recollection of what we did was deal with this issue, terminate people, inform our prudential regulator, and after the City of L.A. inform the CFPB.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: Finally, I would say in my experience in dealing with the Department of Veteran's Affairs and their circumstance, in way too many instances in my view the employees became the scapegoat for what I saw as actions or encouragement behavior by their supervisors. And I would encourage your circumstance -- in your circumstance to make certain that the employees are not the scapegoat for behavior at higher levels.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I think that's a great point, Senator. And I am, you know -- the 268,000 that come to work every day of our team members, they're the most fabulous people, you know. And I just love them and what they do, but I -- the 5,300 for whatever reason, they were dishonest, and I'm not scapegoating, but that is not part of our culture. And some of those jobs, many of those jobs, most of them, were very good American jobs.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: Thank you. Chairman. Senator Merkley. MERKLEY: Thank you. Mr. Stumpf, did Wells Fargo create a pressure cooker sales culture that put personal bankers and tellers in a possible situation between a rock and a hard place?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I do not believe that. Because 90 -- you know, the vast majority...\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Let me continue. You got your answer, thank you. So Rita Murillo, a branch manager, says, "Regional bosses required hourly conferences on her Florida branch's progress toward daily quotas for opening accounts and selling customers extras, such as overdraft protection," an issue that hasn't been addressed yet.\par \par \uc2 "Employees who lagged behind had to stay late and work weekends. Then came the threats: Anyone falling short after two months would be fired. We were constantly told we'd be working for McDonald's. If we did not make the sales quotas, we had to stay for after school detention, it felt like, or report to a call session on Saturdays."\par \par \uc2 Is that a pressure culture situation, putting tellers and personal bankers in an impossible situation?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, that has no place in our culture. I've actually read that, and it hurt to hear those words. And people like that do not belong there.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Eric Estrada, former Wells personal banker and business specialist, said managers coached workers on how to inflate sales number. Employees opened duplicate accounts, sometimes without customers' knowledge. They used a database of customers who had been pre-approved for credit cards and ordered them. They were coached on it.\par \par \uc2 Is that a setting in which a pressure culture -- pressure cooker culture really puts the personal bankers in an impossible situation?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That has no place in Wells Fargo. There's nothing that we did to encourage that.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Nothing you did, but bank managers were being coached on how to coach their employees on how to do this? How about a branch in the Pacific Northwest where I come from? She was very upset when employees had talked a homeless woman into opening six checking accounts. She said, "It's all manipulation. We are taught exactly how to sell multiple accounts. It sounds good, but in reality it doesn't benefit most customers."\par \par \uc2 Or let's talk about Yesenia Guitron who in 2008, after being hired for two months, found that this was happening -- these false accounts were happening. She went to her trainer, then she went to her manager, and she was basically found -- she was pushed very hard to shut up in all kinds of different ways.\par \par \uc2 So you say, "Well, the employee could have gone to somebody." She did, and eventually she filed a whistleblower suit. And why did Wells Fargo say that that was not legitimate? I'll just save you the time, the answer is because Wells Fargo said, "We fired her because we didn't meet her quotas."\par \par \uc2 So here we have a situation where employees are written up, they have to stay late, they have to come in on weekends to be coached, they're at risk of being fired. That sounds like a systemic management strategy for cross-selling. But your refuse to take any responsibility, blaming on the personal ethics of individual employees, who were at risk of losing their job if they didn't meet their "daily solutions" target.\par \par \uc2 Can you even conceivably place yourself in the position of an ordinary working person, has a child in daycare, they're told they're going to be fired if they don't meet these solutions, they're being coached on how to do it by their manager, and say that there was no culture established that caused these problems?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, I am very sorry that that happened. That was not what we wanted to have happen. When those things happened, I wish we would have rooted all of it out. And the vast majority of our people did it the right way...\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Sheriff Kellogg (ph) said, the "branch managers were always asking, \u8216\'20\'18How many solutions,' that's the signing of new accounts, \u8216\'20\'18did you sell today?' They wanted three to four a day."\par \par \uc2 "In my mind, that was crazy. That's not how people's financial lives work. I was always getting written up for failing to bump up my solutions numbers. Some employees would ask local business owners who they knew well to open additional accounts as favors to them.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: "It seems as though you'd have to be willing fully ignorant to believe that these goals are achievable through any other means."\par \par \uc2 Cross-selling is a major pride point for the management of Wells Fargo, including your reports to annual -- annual reports to customers. It was so high because you created a culture of cross- selling that pushed everyone to the maximum. And the casualties of these folks who are going to be fired because they'd lose their jobs if they didn't meet it. And yet you can only sit here and say, it was -- there was no coaching, there was no management strategy. Cross- selling was at the heart of Wells Fargo's program and you were at the top of this for a very long time.\par \par \uc2 Let's go back to 2005, 2007, 2010. You had one major position and promotion after another. Cross-selling was at the heart of it and you just sit here and blame the little person who was pressured into an impossible situation. Isn't that -- really kind of -- for want of another word, a failure to accept responsibility?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, I started out today by accepting full responsibility. We like the idea of having...\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Full responsibility for establishing a culture that put people in impossible situation would be to resign, as my colleagues suggested. It would be to return your funds and help fund assistance for all these people who were fired because of the culture you established. And that you personally benefit an enormous amount from.\par \par \uc2 But all you say, you say, I accept responsibility and by the way, it's the fault of those 5,000 people who just weren't ethical enough and opened an account that they shouldn't have opened. That's not accepting responsibility. This was a systemic problem, that you benefited from enormously. The bank benefited enormously and you are scapegoating the people at the very bottom.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Senator, I just need -- I don't want to be confrontational but I want to just tell you. That the vast majority did the right thing. We loved the idea of having deep mutually beneficial relations with our customers. Having a product, that a customer does not use, does not need or does not want, does not help the customer, it does not help me and it does not help the shareholder.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: You signed, Oxbanes -- Sarbanes-Oxley reports. Did you ever reveal the problems with this high pressure sales strategy, in terms of fraudulent credit accounts? Any time in that course towards two million -- two million fraudulent accounts. Did you ever disclose that to your investors?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, let me just say...\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Well yes or no.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, Senator...\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: It's a simple question.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It -- it Senator, the question is two million fraudulent. There was two millions accounts that we could not rule out, as a possibility that they weren't authorized.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: I'm so glad you crossed that t and dotted that i. Did you ever disclose the systemic problem of fraudulent accounts to your investors?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: It was not a material event.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: So you bragged on the one end, about the intensive ability to get cross-selling and how that would be beneficial. But the problems that came from that strategy. The very problems that dozens and dozens of people have shared their stories about how it was on the ground. And you can only blame them for ethical lapses. You never disclosed you had a systemic problem.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Again...\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: You sign those reports personally, that's what Sarbanes-Oxley was, didn't think that that was material? When you're saying, this is our big -- this is our big win is our cross-selling strategy, not to disclose it, also had a dark side?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: There was a lot of things that our customers do and a lot of businesses that we have. This is one ratio, and most of this business -- first of all -- all of deposit accounts are off the books. Most of them went on and off within the same quarter in which they happened. Having a customer have a product that they do not need is not helpful. It's not what we want.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: I'm going to close just by saying, I would like to hear about the -- the amount of slamming that went on -- on overdraft protection. Since that's come up and a number of employees talked about they were pressured into adding that.\par \par \uc2 Do you have details on that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I do not.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Can you get us extensive details on that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I don't know of that issue, off the top of my head. But I'll have my staff -- I'll instruct them to work with your team as quickly as they can. MERKLEY: Can you get the information for the full committee?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'll have my team work with your team. I don't even know exactly what we're talking about.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: You don't know what overdraft protection is?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I know what overdraft protection is. I know that we had a credit card product for overdraft protection. But I'll have my team work with your team.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: And please get the information to the full committee. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Brown, you have another question?\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you Mr. Chairman. And thank you for starting a second round, I appreciate that. There's so much more to discuss. First, I ask the man of consent, to enter to the record the testimony within the House, by colleague Taha (ph), and Julie Miller (ph), two people who worked at Wells Fargo.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Without objection.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 A couple of clarification of points and then two or three more questions Mr. Stumpf. I've -- we've discussed who was fired, where the employees were fired, understand it, for just those watching and listening for the record especially, 90 percent of the people fired were not managers on that. It means they were tellers, $12 to $15 personal bankers, $16 to maybe $18, $19 or $20 an hour, but most of the people fired were not branch mangers and were not regional mangers.\par \par \uc2 On second, there's a mention that only credit cards would affect credit scores in the answer to one of these questions. But if funds were removed out of a checking account and someone bounced a check for a car payment. That could end up effecting credit scores. So, while it may narrowly be only credit cards, it really isn't in that definition.\par \par \uc2 A couple of questions, Senator Scott asked about where employees can go with ethics concerns, Mr. Stumpf. It sounded, from whistleblower lawsuits, that an ethics -- that ethics complaint often resulted in confronting the very managers condoning this behavior, is that true?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I don't believe that is true. I don't know. I can get back to you on that.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: How do they, how do they register an ethics complaint, other than calling CFPB or the L.A. prose county attorney or the L.A. Times?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: As I understand, how are ethics line works, you call. It's an anonymous call. It's handled by a third party outside the company, who does work on that and then reports it to the company.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: OK. I would like more on that. Because my understanding is, at least initially, you have to confront your supervisor who has much to say about it. Now that we know what we do, will Wells Fargo continue to take the position in court, to contractual agreements on mandatory arbitrations. Question about mandatory arbitration, the fine print of so many of these contracts if you will.\par \par \uc2 Will Wells Fargo continue to take the position in court, the contractual agreements on mandatory arbitration, covering real accounts will apply to fraudulent ones well? And that customers will be forced into arbitration rather than having access to the courts?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I've instructed our team to do whatever it takes, within reason to take care of these customers. I'd have to talk to my legal team and we can get back to you on that.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: All right. Understanding, they, what has happened in the past. These mandatory arbitration clauses, which many of us I know on this committee don't think fair generally. And most consumers don't understand that they are part of a mandatory -- even know what it is -- and part of a mandatory arbitration arrangement. That that's been applied to these fraudulent -- fraudulent accounts in addition to the ones that were not fraudulent. Understand that's what's happened so I hope your answer is specifically in response to that.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Again, I'll talk to our team and we'll get back to you. I just -- again I'm not an expert in that.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Mr. -- Ms. Tolstedt reported directly to you. How frequently did you talk to one another?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We had at least, weekly meetings.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: OK. And from 2007, when you both took your perspective roles, until the end of 2013, did none of this firing and for fraudulent accounts and all, did none of this ever come up in your weekly or more than weekly meetings?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I remember being, at least, making an impression upon me in 2013.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: But from 2007, when you had your perspective roles. So for six years, regular meetings with one of your most important -- one of your most important managers, this discussion of 1,000 people a year beginning in \u8216\'20\'1811. But we may go beyond, earlier than that we think.\par \par \uc2 Those discussions, you have no recall that that ever came up?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I -- I -- not in the way that I had in 2013.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: OK. Over the past 10 years, your bank just had approximately 39 enforcement actions. Just a few of which have come up today. Many were related to failure to serve or abusive conduct towards customer and investors. You talk much about Wells culture, how proud you are of it and it's ethics. What does this say? If you had 39 enforcement actions, what does this say about Wells culture and compliance programs?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We have more work to do. And we're trying very, very hard to build out all of the compliance that we need to be, you know, to treat customers fairly. And to make sure that we do things right everyday.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Last question Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your indulgence.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Menendez.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: No, can I just, this is the last question. I'm sorry Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 People -- we know about the 5,300 employees who you say committed some -- many people up here have said that the pressure was on them, was so great that they did things that they shouldn't have or maybe apparently, you said they all -- I think you said they deserve to be fired.\par \par \uc2 What about the people who got -- I mean, understanding, too, that's 5,300, then there were at least hundreds more who refused to cheat or quit just because they didn't want to be part of this and they saw what happened to others -- but what about the people who got fired for not meeting goals that you now are saying were ill-advised?\par \par \uc2 So there was a large -- if I think -- a large -- certainly a significant number of people who were fired for not meeting their goals. No you say those goals were ill advised. What do you do to make those employees -- how do you identify them, how many are there, and what do you do to make those employees whole?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah. I -- I have to talk with that team. I don't know about those numbers. I don't know how -- how significant or -- or widespread that is and I can get back to you on that.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Well, will you -- well then more precisely, I understand I expected you not to know that number, but if there is one, that's one. If there are a hundred or a thousand. For those that were fired for not meeting those goals that you say are now ill-advised, do you have plans to make them -- to make them whole?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah, I have to talk to our team. Again, I don't know the numbers and I just -- I -- frankly haven't worked closely...\par \par \uc2 BROWN: I didn't expect you to know the numbers, but doesn't it -- does it -- in your mind and -- does it -- in your conscience does it say those people were fired because they didn't meet -- reach goals, the goals were ill-advised, shouldn't you make it up to them?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, again, I don't even -- you know -- I know where you're going with your line of questioning. I'm trying to be cooperative. I just haven't -- I haven't talked to our HR team. I don't know the numbers, I don't know the situations, I don't know if there are other things involved. So I -- I... BROWN: Again, I'm not -- I'm less concerned about the numbers than the morality of it. I would like to at least ask you to do this, then. Once you've made that determination of how many there are, I would like you to make them whole and if you're not willing to make them whole, I'd like a written response about why you have made the decision not to make them whole.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: OK. I'll talk to our team and we'll get back to you.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Menendez.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf, let me give you a real life example, we're (ph) talking about people whose credit scores were hurt. Linda Edwards and her daughter are Wells Fargo customers from New Jersey.\par \par \uc2 Accounts were opened in their name without their acquiescence, knowledge, including credit cards, of her daughter who is just starting college. She has a negative consequence on her credit score, which has not been resolved by Wells Fargo.\par \par \uc2 She happened -- you got the wrong person when you did it to this lady because she happened to be a former staffer at the New Jersey Division of Banking and Insurance. And when she called your company and asked for the fraud division, she was said (ph) no, don't just, said call customer service.\par \par \uc2 So to this date, that question of her daughter's credit score, who's starting college and obviously wants a good credit score, is affected. So there's real life people here who Wells Fargo has not responded to.\par \par \uc2 Let me ask you this, is cross-selling an industry-wide reality, as is evidenced by Wells Fargo, or is it unique to Wells Fargo?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I don't know what other companies do. I know we view it as an important metric as it relates to depth of relationship. And relationship...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: You don't know if other banks do this?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I wouldn't -- I do not know.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: You don't review what your competition is doing to figure out whether there's something you should be doing? So you don't have any idea if they do cross-selling?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I do not know that...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: OK, we'll have to ask the regulators. Let me ask you this. Material -- he said it was not a material event to Senator Merkley. Not a material event?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Material financial event. This is a... MENENDEZ: How about a material for the SEC disclosure which you said you never made?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You don't -- I'm not a lawyer and I -- I rely on my legal team...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Based upon what's happened to the stock for your shareholders, it definitely was a material event that should have come forward. Let me ask you this.\par \par \uc2 Miss Tolstedt, I -- in response to one of the questions you said that you, and I think the COO met with her and said you wanted to move in a different direction...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Correct.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: ... and she decided to leave. That sounds to me a lot like you can either leave or you're not going to -- you're going to be fired, maybe, but is it that you created a situation to give her the option to leave because you were concerned about what she might say about practices of the bank and higher ups?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: In fact, when Tim talked -- Tim Sloan, our chief operating officer and president -- talked with her, we said we want to go in a different direction, there were a number of things he was thinking about doing different in the business and we had not made enough, along with my consultation, (inaudible) enough progress here and she was retirement eligible, she decided to retire. It never went beyond that.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: You had no concerns of what she might say if brought before the Senate or any other entity and put under oath about what she might say about what was known or not known?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That didn't even come into the...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Let me ask you this. How -- what were the repercussions of not meeting sales quotas besides not getting the bonus. Can you tell me how many workers faced discipline over the same five-year period for failing to meet sales goals? How many workers that failed to meet those sales goals were terminated?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I do not have those numbers, but I will tell you this, Senator...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: I think it's important to know those numbers. You don't know how many people you terminated? You know how many people you terminated who you said did the wrong thing, but you don't know how many people you terminated because they didn't meet the overwhelming cooker boiler that you put them under.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I don't have those -- I don't have those numbers.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Well I'd like you to get those numbers to the committee. STUMPF: I'll talk with our team and -- and I'll...\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Let me -- let me...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: ... as far as I can.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: You said to Senator Scott that of course there were opportunities when he asked about Safe Harbors. You could raise your hand, there was an anonymous ethics line, there was no pressure cooker. Now, do you read your e-mail, Mr. Stumpf?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I read my e-mails.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: OK. So I'd like to read to you an excerpt from an e- mail one of my constituents sent to you in 2011. She was a branch manager at Wells Fargo and I spoke to her yesterday about her experiences at Wells Fargo.\par \par \uc2 In 2011 she wrote to you, "I'm currently," and I'm quoting now, "I am currently an assistant vice president manager at a" -- and I'll leave the location out -- "in northern New Jersey. I have been an employee of Wachovia for over 22 years, of which Wells Fargo acquired. I'm writing to you because as a team member I feel hurt and disappointed with this company.\par \par \uc2 "There are challenges that team members are faced, with but those should not be the reason to move money from one account to another and to fool the motivator" -- the person who you had to go to -- who constantly was badgering you about whether or not you had opened enough accounts -- "that we have new accounts.\par \par \uc2 "These funds that are moved to new accounts to show growth, when in actuality there is no net gain to the company's deposit base, is wrong. In the past months I was placed on warning for not meeting these goals and the reason that the bankers underneath me do not is because I will not tolerate the movement of existing money just because we need checking account solutions and profit proxy to move to the motivator. These accounts make no sense for the customer."\par \par \uc2 Did you read that e-mail?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yeah -- I don't remember that one.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: OK, well she was fired. So, so much for the safe haven. So much for coming forth. She went to the president and CEO of the company, that's about as good as it gets, and she found no safe haven there.\par \par \uc2 Finally let me ask you this. In 2012, Wells Fargo, then and now the largest mortgage lender in the country, agreed to pay $175 million to settle accusations that the bank discriminated against African- Americans and Hispanic borrowers in their mortgage lending from 2004 to 2009.\par \par \uc2 An investigation by the Department of Justice's civil rights division found that Wells Fargo discriminated by steering approximately 4,000 African-American and Hispanic borrowers into subprime mortgages when non-Hispanic white borrowers with similar credit profiles received prime loans.\par \par \uc2 When I look at this history, I get concerned with what's going on here. Do you have demographics of those customers who were hurt in this process and can you share it with the committee?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes -- let me just go back to that particular case. I regret that that was done through a wholesale business. We were -- other people outside of our company originated those mortgages and we were closing them and we shut down that division.\par \par \uc2 In this case we don't -- when we take applications or when we do business for deposits and credit card, we capture age and there was no -- in fact, it skewed towards younger to middle age Americans.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Well, I'd suggest you read page 36-D, item 36-D on page nine of the Los Angeles City Attorney's 2015 complaint filed against Wells Fargo describing a Wells Fargo gaming practice of targeting individuals holding Mexican consulate cards.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I don't -- I'll look at that, yes.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Schumer.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: Well, thank you.\par \par \uc2 And I apologize to the witness. It's been a busy morning.\par \par \uc2 First, I want to just say -- and I know other people have spoken about this -- in terms of rescinding the bonuses, to the average American it just seems appalling that somebody who could make such large mistakes should be rewarded to almost an obscene amount of money, $120 million.\par \par \uc2 And so I would simply -- I'm not gonna -- I know this has been discussed, I would say your bank has overall a good reputation. For the reputation of your bank, for the value of your shares, as well as relationships with customers, I would urgently urge you to not allow those bonuses to occur and urge the compensation committee -- I know which you sit on -- to do that.\par \par \uc2 That's just a statement for the record. Now, I'd like to talk about the CFPB because they have done incredible work over the past five years. But this case exemplifies why the CFPB was created. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was formed to ensure that financial institutions that harm consumers through unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, are held accountable and that the consumers are made whole again.\par \par \uc2 In fact, over the course of it's short history, it's gotten $12 billion in relief and restitution. Today's hearing reminds us, why the CFPB was formed. We need a cop out on the beat. The incentives and practices that cross-selling goals promoted at Wells Fargo were very, very wrong and bad, as I'm sure you've said.\par \par \uc2 They infected the work environment at branches in the country and including in New York. Beyond the financial damage, Wells Fargo's actions violated consumer trust. Wells will have to work long and hard to regain the trust of millions of Americans but those Americans can rest assured, now more than ever, knowing that there's a CFPB out there.\par \par \uc2 So I would just ask you, Mr. Stumpf, given what you've been through and I know it's not been a pleasant experience, do you agree federal regulators like CFPB and OCC serve a valuable role in promoting safety and stability, as well as necessary consumer protections?\par \par \uc2 I'm saying this because a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle want to either get rid of or greatly reduce the power of the CFPB.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We share the mission of all of our regulators created by Congress, including the CFPB and we're working with all of them.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: So you think the CFPB is a necessary thing?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, I -- again, it's created by Congress and we agree to work with all of them and we've worked closely in this matter with them.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: OK and do you believe that the reforms -- I'll let the answer speak for itself. I would -- we think the CFPB has done an outstanding job and what's happened at the bank whether you know, however it happened shows the need for it.\par \par \uc2 OK do you believe the reforms that Wells committed to and goals required under the consent agreement you signed with the CFPB will allow Wells to go back on a path of protecting customer's interests and putting consumers first?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes, we believe that we have a lot of work to do.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: OK as per the terms of the consent agreement, will you work with the CFPB to ensure that Wells' customers that were negatively impacted are made whole?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Yes.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: Good. OK were you aware that the CFPB was aware of the cross-selling and looking into concerns about cross-selling as early as 2013.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: You know, I only know what we did. I don't know what the CFPB did.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: OK they were. So they were on this case I think before at least your top management discovered this which is to their credit.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I don't know that.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: OK, OK well, Director Cordray will be here in a little bit so we'll ask him and see if that was the case, I believe it to be the case. And finally, do you believe that the actions taken by the CFPB here will lead to other financial institutions to re-evaluate and reconsider their own cross-selling practices?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I have no idea on that.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: Yeah I think they will. I think they will and I think the CFPB has had a very salutary influence and I hope you'd come around to the view that it's a necessary part of our system of banking and governing. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Thank you -- Mr. Chairman, if I might make one comment.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Senator Schumer, for your questions. You made a comment that I'm on the Human Resources and Compensation Committee, I am not. I just wanna make sure that's part of the record.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: Oh OK well, I would still urge you to -- is that the committee, though that's in charge of the bonuses?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: That's the one that makes the recommendation to the full board and of course, I'm not part of the full board and those decisions.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: OK I would urge you to urge everybody who is on these committees to do just what we had asked.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: OK thank you.\par \par \uc2 SCHUMER: OK thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Warren?\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I wanna say again, thank you very much for being so responsive to us, for holding this hearing when we sent you a letter to ask you to do it and thank you for being so generous about time.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: I hope (ph) responsive to the American people, not just to you.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Thank you very much. I really appreciate your holding this hearing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf, as you know, some of my colleagues and I sent you a letter last week about the board's plans to claw back compensation from senior executives who are responsible for overseeing this scam.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo provided us with a response yesterday, I noticed that although we sent the letter to you, that the response actually came from somebody else in the company, which I guess is another example of holding yourself accountable. I wanna focus now, on the mysterious circumstances surrounding Carrie Tolstedt's retirement in July.\par \par \uc2 As you know, Ms. Tolstedt ran the community banking division, the division where this scam occurred for the entire time that this scam took place. She was in charge of all the 5,300 employees who were fired and she oversaw the creation of 2 million fake accounts. Now, in July of this year just two months before the settlement was announced and before those facts became public, Ms. Tolstedt retired at age 56.\par \par \uc2 You indicated in the letter, responding to our letter, that she walks away with over $90 million in stocks stock options and awards. Fortune Magazine says it's actually about $125 million. But -- and here's the key part -- according to Fortune, if Ms. Tolstedt has been fired instead of returning, she would've had to forfeit as much as $45 million of that award.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf, the response to our letter confirms that knew of this scandal. Before Ms. Tolstedt retired, it said -- and this is from your letter, quote, "Senior management and the board were aware of the pending litigation, investigation and discussions with our regulators, relating to sales practices when Ms. Tolstedt indicated her decision to retire."\par \par \uc2 Is that accurate, Mr. Stumpf, what this letter says? Were you personally aware of the massive problem that occurred under Ms. Tolstedt's watch in July when she announced her retirement?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I was aware that we were involved in discussions with the city attorney, the OCC and the CFPB, yes.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: So you had some indication there was a massive problem?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: We had some indication that we had one percent of our people who were doing the wrong thing.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Also known as a massive problem.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: If you knew this, did you consider firing Ms. Tolstedt before she retired?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well, at the time she was reporting to our president and chief operating officer and...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: It's a simple question, you knew there was a problem, did you consider firing her?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: No because of her full...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Seriously? You found out that one of your divisions had created 2 million fake accounts, had fired thousands of employees for improper behavior and had cheated thousands of your own customers and you didn't even once consider firing her ahead of her retirement?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: In fact, when I look at her full body of work and I look at the -- at the customer loyalty improvement and the customer service improvement...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Are you sure that those were not fake?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: All the work that was done, she chose to retire and I'd also like to make one other comment because you made... (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: So -- so you -- no just on this, you never considered firing her. So now Ms. Tolstedt has apparently retired but is also staying with the firm through the end of the year. And in the response to our letter, you state -- or the person writing it -- states, quote, "Ms. Tolstedt is eligible to be considered for a 2016 annual incentive award."\par \par \uc2 An incentive award for doing a great job in 2016? Mr. Stumpf, that is unbelievable. You are the chairman of the board and the CEO. In those roles, do you think it would be appropriate for Ms. Tolstedt to get another bonus on top of the millions that she has already gotten as a reward for her role in this massive scam?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: The board will consider that and I don't wanna prejudice the board but I also want to make one comment...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: I don't understand that answer.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: You know, you and your board have already made changes. You've made changes to the compensation scheme for thousands of employees. You've sat here today and talked about that. You've removed sales quotas, I think you've told us. You've reformed incentives.\par \par \uc2 Why can't that be done quick as a wink across the entire bank but a question about cutting compensation for a highly placed executive who oversaw a massive fraud takes long deliberation? Why is that?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Because there's a board governance process and we want that to work properly. And whether Carrie was retired or she was fired there'd be no difference with respect to how the board can deal with that.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: I'm sorry if she was fired, it is my understanding she would not be entitled to large parts of her compensation. This is not just a claw back issue we're talking about she doesn't get them to begin with if she gets fired. But you let her walk out of the door with a retirement. I don't quite understand. How do you explain this to your own shareholders?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: There is a process that the board goes through and they will do that. They've already met (ph)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Mr. Stumpf...\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: ... and everyone give that their...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: I don't understand. You keep saying there's, you know, the board, the board, as if these are strangers that you met in a dark alley. Under the bylaws of Wells Fargo and I'm quoting here "The Chairman shall preside at all meetings of the board."\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 WARREN: You were able to make changes. Why can you not make a change here?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm not on the Human Resources Committee of the board. They have their own governance and structure. We want that to proceed in the process in which we have.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: All right so we'll do this your way. Our letter asked a number of questions about claw backs of Ms. Tolstedt's and other executive's pay, including yours. Wells Fargo answer to our letter was just basically, you punted, that the decision would be up to the board. The same punt you've given here.\par \par \uc2 So you're the Chairman of the Board, let me ask it this way: will you personally support clawing back all or part of Ms. Tolstedt's pay?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm not going to in any way try to influence or prejudice the board as they do their deliberation.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: So you have absolutely no opinion on this?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm not going to opine on that--\par \par \uc2 WARREN: You're not going to opine. You're going to say get out there, defraud, cheat, lie, steal, and I have nothing to say about whether or not you ought to still be getting your bonus?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I never said, and I would, we'd never say as our company, go out there and do any of those things. We try to do the right thing every day.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: But you say if you do them, you can count on Chairman Stumpf not to stand up and say you shouldn't get your incentive bonus.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: The board has a process...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: I think you started this whole thing by saying, don't tell me what you say, tell me what your actions are. And your actions are, people do this and you're not going to take a single step to shut it down.\par \par \uc2 So I guess I can ask this question again, will you personally support clawing back any or all of the pay for the person in charge of compliance, someone we haven't talked about much today. The person who is supposed to be responsible to make sure that the bank is following the law.\par \par \uc2 Will you have any recommendation about that person?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I'm going to have the board do their process.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: You are going to have no recommendation at all?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: I...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Ever? At any point in this process?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Whatever the board accepts, whatever they do I will accept and I will support.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: You are not passive here. If you have nothing to do then what are you doing serving as Chairman of the Board? If you have no opinions on the most massive fraud that has hit this bank since the beginning of time how can it be that you actually get to continue to collect a paycheck for being Chairman of the Board?\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: Well first of all, I disagree with the fact this is a massive fraud. But secondly the board will do their work and I'm not going to prejudice their work. And I will accept whatever they come up with and I will be supportive.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Now, I, you accepted all along as this fraud built up, this massive fraud, you accepted all of the performance bonuses based on the cross selling that is at the heart of this. You watched your own stock go up by more than $200 million based in part on exactly this massive fraud.\par \par \uc2 You got out and you pumped it to Wall Street and you said to Wall Street, hey we are doing such a great job cross selling here at Wells Fargo, you should tell everybody to buy our stock.\par \par \uc2 And now you turn around and say I shall remain passive and simply accept what Wells Fargo wants to do. You know in 2008 Wall Street promised change. But it looks like it is business as usual. A giant bank cheats the little guys and the executives line their own pockets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stumpf you make it clear that Wall Street won't change until we make it change. Thank you Mr. Chair.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Mr. Stumpf thank you for appearing today. We have some questions for the record. We have another panel.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: OK.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: I hope you will answer these questions for the record; we have a number of them.\par \par \uc2 STUMPF: OK, thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 END\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160920ec9k009hp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Data provider App Annie's estimate of "Pokemon Go" revenue was made before subtracting the 30% commission that Apple and Google collect at their app stores. A Heard on the Street article Tuesday about revenue assumptions for smartphone games said App Annie's estimate of more than $500 million excluded the commissions, incorrectly implying the gross revenue was more than $700 million.\par \par \uc2 (WSJE Sept. 22, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 Europe Banks Show Risk\par \par \uc2 Global rule makers think some banks are too clever by half. They want to limit the capital benefits those banks get from sophisticated risk models because they worry that these create a level of accuracy and detail as seductive as it is fallible.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Basel Committee\uc2 , which sets global banking rules, wants to rein in the outliers: Those banks whose models produce the lowest-risk weightings and create most benefits in reducing their capital requirements.\par \par \uc2 This will disproportionately affect European banks versus U.S. peers because Europeans have long designed their businesses around a risk-based approach to capital, while U.S. banks historically were governed by simpler leverage ratios that use plain asset measures.\par \par \uc2 It is quite easy to see which banks in Europe face the biggest potential impact from the changes currently being designed and debated by the rule makers who should complete them by year-end.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 , \uc2 Societe Generale\uc2 , \uc2 Barclays\uc2  and \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  all have a relatively low risk density, which is a measure of how little risk a bank assigns to the assets on its books. Each has a risk density of less than 30%, which means that every euro of loans or securities they own is worth less than 30 euro cents in risk-weighted assets. And it is risk-weighted assets that determine a bank's capital requirement. For comparison, \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  has a risk density of 61%.\par \par \uc2 Partly, this is because European banks tend to own less-risky assets. But crucially, these four European lenders have low risk density compared with some other European peers and they also have relatively low capital ratios, which means they have less equity to cover any demands to increase capital.\par \par \uc2 Rule makers want in effect to limit how low this density can get -- to close the gap between the lowest and highest.\par \par \uc2 Other banks have low densities, for example in the Nordic region, but more defenses against the potential changes. Swedbank of Sweden has one of the lowest densities anywhere because like local peers it measures mortgages as super safe. However, local regulators have neutralized this by directly increasing capital requirements without touching risk measures, though they did that to cool their housing markets more than because they worried risk models were fantasy.\par \par \uc2 In the U.K., a bank such as \uc2 Lloyds Banking Group\uc2  also measures mortgages as very low risk. However, its very healthy capital buffer means it can cope with being forced to assign a higher risk weighting, though its potential for dividends and special payouts could suffer.\par \par \uc2 Other banks like \uc2 UniCredit\uc2  of Italy or Santander of Spain, which are relative weaklings in terms of capital ratios, are actually insulated against the rule changes because their assets are measured at almost twice the risk of a \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  or \uc2 Societe Generale\uc2  and so require twice the capital.\par \par \uc2 The final impact will be unclear until the rules are completed, but industry groups have forecast a 10% increase in capital requirements on average. That hides the fact that some banks will face stiffer changes than others: \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 , which also faces costly legal settlements, reckons its risk-weighted assets could rise by 100 billion euros ($112 billion), or about 25%.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to capital demands, European banks still aren't out of the woods.\par \par \uc2 -- Paul J. Davies\par \par \uc2 A Mystery Behind\par \par \uc2 Mobile-Game Hits\par \par \uc2 Mobile-game megahits may bring in more revenue than blockbuster movies, but measuring their "box office" is a tougher task. That leaves investors playing in the dark.\par \par \uc2 Take "Pokemon Go" as an example: Its off-the-charts performance has sent \uc2 Nintendo\uc2  shares skyrocketing this year. Yet nailing down actual revenue numbers is a tricky game.\par \par \uc2 Data provider Sensor Tower said earlier this month that the augmented-reality game brought in more revenue over the summer than some Hollywood movies such as "Warcraft" or "Independence Day: Resurgence." It said the game has brought in $529 million of gross revenue as of Sept. 10.\par \par \uc2 Some think the game has done even better. \uc2 App Annie\uc2  said on Sept. 8 that revenue for "Pokemon Go" already has surpassed $500 million, on track to become a $1 billion game by the end of this year. Since \uc2 App Annie\uc2  takes out the 30% commission Apple and \uc2 Google\uc2  collect at their app stores from the revenue numbers, it means the gross revenue for "Pokemon Go" is more than $700 million by its estimate.\par \par \uc2 Some estimates are far less sanguine. Priori Data said the game has brought in only slightly more than $100 million. SuperData thinks it is closer to $359 million.\par \par \uc2 The problem lies in the fact that Apple and \uc2 Google\uc2  don't disclose revenue data for individual apps. They also don't rank their apps purely by revenue, but by secret algorithms. Many publishers, especially the big ones, don't disclose their revenue data, either. The fact that a game's success relies on only a small number of big-spending players making in-app purchases, nicknamed whales, further complicates the calculus.\par \par \uc2 So data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  companies have to rely on intellectual guesswork. They gather data from some publishers that do provide revenue numbers and try to correlate them with other metrics such as overall market size, rankings on the app stores and number of reviews. Some, like Sensor Tower, also may survey a panel of users. Others, like SuperData, collect data from payment-service providers that handle transactions for publishers.\par \par \uc2 The approach works well for games that perform similarly to past titles. But for breakout hits like "Pokemon Go," it could be less reliable. The "\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 " analysis relies on inference from past correlations, which could break down if the game is a true outlier.\par \par \uc2 As mobile takes the center stage of the gaming world, investors are bound to see more off-the-charts games. "Super Mario Run," the character's first appearance on smartphones, could be the next one when it launches in December. \uc2 Nintendo\uc2 's volatile two months has showed that investors may need better data to inform their decisions.\par \par \uc2 -- Jacky Wong\par \par \uc2 Overheard\par \par \uc2 For George Soros it was severe backache that always drove him to overhaul his investments. For many other traders, it is an ill-defined gut instinct.\par \par \uc2 Now, an academic study claims to have shown that financial traders with a strong sense of their bodies' rhythms and reactions, conscious or not, make better profits and survive in markets for longer.\par \par \uc2 The small study is a long way from proving anything, but has gained attention partly because of the involvement of John Coates, a former trader and the author of "The Hour Between Dog and Wolf," who has become a leading proponent of the influence of biology in risk taking.\par \par \uc2 To test the power of gut instinct on investing, the study assessed 18 male high-frequency futures traders on their ability to detect their own heart rate and then looked back at their trading history.\par \par \uc2 Heart-rate perception is a good indicator of strong "interoceptive" capabilities, having a good sense of your internal state. Pain, hunger or breathlessness can all be signs of physical memories from previous experiences that can help decision making.\par \par \uc2 Other studies have found that people with this sense make better decisions in gambling tests.\par \par \uc2 This study, which involved the Universities of Cambridge and Sussex in the U.K., made two further findings: First that traders have better interoceptive ability than wider populations and second that the traders with the best sense of themselves made better profits and had enjoyed longer careers.\par \par \uc2 So, if you find financial decisions a real pain in the neck, that may be a good sign.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20160920000031"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020160920ec9k00015\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

However, 4C is not an ad network, as it does not purchase and resell ad inventory.\par \par \uc2 Last year 4C acquired Teletrax, a TV monitoring network for real-time TV \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and cross-screen synchronized marketing campaigns. These can target a TV viewer through mobile channels while the viewer is watching a particular program. Teletrax's data gives 4C insight into how consumers engage with social media while watching TV, said {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.4cinsights.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 4C}}}\uc2  Chief Executive Lance Neuhauser.\par \par \uc2 The startup has partnerships with social networks including \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Pinterest\uc2 . Earlier this year Snapchat selected 4C as one of its eight initial advertising partners.\par \par \uc2 Being selected as a Snapchat partner "certainly raised [4C's] profile in the industry," said Kayne Partners Vice President \uc2 Leon Chen\uc2 , though he said his firm's investment was independent of that announcement. Mr. Chen has joined the board of 4C.\par \par \uc2 The company will use the new funding to grow its product team and further its geographic reach.\par \par \uc2 Write to Patience Haggin at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:patience.haggin@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 patience.haggin@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160920ec9k004my\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

"Of course you should invest in [your own] fund," he said.\par \par \uc2 Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the asset management consultancy, said he expected manager investment levels to be higher. "Since the 2008 crisis, more asset managers have been revamping their incentive systems to encourage co-investing," he said. "The rhetoric of the reported changes has been running ahead of the reality."\par \par \uc2 A number of smaller investment companies demonstrated much higher levels of skin in the game, including \uc2 Dodge & Cox\uc2  , Oakmark and Primecap Odyssey. One hundred per cent of these companies' funds had portfolio managers invested in them.\par \par \uc2 The data also showed that asset managers running funds with lower fees were more likely to invest in their own products, suggesting manager investment could lead to lower costs and better performance, according to \uc2 Russel Kinnel\uc2 , head of research at \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said: "Fund managers are savvy investors, so they are less likely to invest in gimmicky, high-cost funds. I remember one firm telling us that they didn't invest much [in their own funds] because they would rather invest in something cheaper."\par \par \uc2 He added that it was surprising how many funds had zero levels of investment from their portfolio managers.\par \par \uc2 In Europe, rules that came into effect earlier this year require mutual fund managers to receive part of their bonuses as units of the funds they run. Mr Kinnel believes this change will have a spillover effect and pressure US fund managers to increase investments in their funds.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160919ec9j00006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The nation even has the unique distinction of losing a tenure, albeit a brief one, in the early part of the 20th century as one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s 10 richest nations to become just another developing country.\par \par \uc2 But Lino Bara\u241\'00\'F1ao, Argentina\u8217\'20\'19s minister for science, technology and innovation, says a chronically dysfunctional economy has \u8212\'20\'14 perversely \u8212\'20\'14 almost been beneficial for start-ups. Often having to struggle with double-, sometimes triple-digit inflation as well as all manner of economic controls, necessarily financially savvy Argentines have been forced \u8220\'20\'1Cto find ways to dodge the rules\u8221\'20\'1D, says Bara\u241\'00\'F1ao. \u8220\'20\'1CIn many ways that is negative, but it can be good for innovation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a rebel spirit in Argentina,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, arguing that this has been instilled by waves of ambitious immigrants from Europe and beyond. This has given rise to a diverse and creative population that has benefited from an excellent public education system, as well as some 40 universities and more than 30 research centres.\par \par \uc2 Bara\u241\'00\'F1ao was the only minister asked to stay on from the previous administration. In the past decade he has overseen a cultural change in which Argentina\u8217\'20\'19s universities have been shedding a solely academic focus on producing research papers. Students are increasingly encouraged to make prototypes and investigate the feasibility of setting up technology companies. State funding is available for the best proposals.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, a lack of financing opportunities from the private sector has so far presented one of the biggest challenges. But that may be changing as interest from US venture capital companies grows, thanks to a regulatory system that is more agile than that of the US.\par \par \uc2 And, after years of a complicated climate for businesses in Argentina, the new government has made important moves in its drive to \u8220\'20\'1Cnormalise\u8221\'20\'1D the country. Moreover, says Bara\u241\'00\'F1ao, \u8220\'20\'1Cfor the first time there is strong co-ordination between the national and city governments\u8221\'20\'1D, both of which are focused on promoting Buenos Aires as a technology hub.\par \par \uc2 The market in Argentina itself is relatively small, but that has bred a more global mindset among its entrepreneurs than in countries such as Brazil or Mexico, where they concentrate on servicing their own huge markets. Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that four of Latin America\u8217\'20\'19s six \u8220\'20\'1Cunicorns\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 tech start-ups now valued at more than $1bn \u8212\'20\'14 emerged in Argentina.\par \par \uc2 Globant\par \par \uc2 Founded 2003\par \par \uc2 Genesis Four friends came up with an idea in an Irish pub in central Buenos Aires after they lost their jobs in the 2001 crash\par \par \uc2 Value $1.7bn\par \par \uc2 Globant develops software for big companies mainly in the US and the UK. Its exclusive focus on emerging technologies, as opposed to traditional IT companies, has driven rapid growth and earned the company a reputation as one of Latin America\u8217\'20\'19s most innovative businesses.\par \par \uc2 The company aims to build and improve what it calls \u8220\'20\'1Cdigital journeys\u8221\'20\'1D for consumers, enabling its clients to engage better with their users through highly targeted and fast-evolving technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Globant\u8217\'20\'19s first client was UK travel website \uc2 lastminute.com\uc2  and in 2006 it became the first tech company to secure a contract with \uc2 Google\uc2 , helping it to build an impressive client portfolio that includes \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2 , \uc2 Disney\uc2 , \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 , Fifa and NatGeo.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, Globant became the region\u8217\'20\'19s first software company to float on the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2 . Since then its share price has quadrupled. Based in Buenos Aires, it has offices across Argentina and in 12 countries.\par \par \uc2 Chief executive and co-founder Mart\u237\'00\'EDn Migoya, who likes to call his 5,200 employees \u8220\'20\'1Cglobers\u8221\'20\'1D, says he is following in the tradition of Silicon Valley\u8217\'20\'19s most successful companies to combine engineering, innovation and world-class design with scale.\par \par \uc2 MercadoLibre\par \par \uc2 Founded 1999\par \par \uc2 Genesis Co-founder \uc2 Marcos Galper\u237\'00\'EDn\uc2  delivered his pitch to John Muse, a private equity fund founder he was driving to the airport.

A household name across Latin America, it is the region\u8217\'20\'19s only internet company listed on Nasdaq.\par \par \uc2 After surviving the 2000 dotcom crash thanks to co-founder \uc2 Marcos Galper\u237\'00\'EDn\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s ability to raise financial support, the company swiftly caught the attention of \uc2 eBay\uc2 . The US giant acquired a 19.5 per cent stake in exchange for its Brazilian subsidiary pledging not to return to Latin America for at least five years.\par \par \uc2 That cleared the way for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.mercadolibre.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 MercadoLibre\u8217\'20\'19s  }}}\uc2  rapid expansion, executing a timely initial public offering in August 2007, helping it to weather the global financial crisis that was setting in at exactly the same time.\par \par \uc2 Now one of Argentina\u8217\'20\'19s biggest companies and with a market capitalisation of more than $6.5bn, each year \uc2 MercadoLibre\uc2  matches 30m buyers and sellers (about 5 per cent of the region\u8217\'20\'19s population) of anything from computers to cars. The site boasts a gross annual merchandise volume of some $8bn.\par \par \uc2 But Galper\u237\'00\'EDn, who is MercadoLibre\u8217\'20\'19s chief executive and its biggest shareholder, reckons this is \u8220\'20\'1Cminuscule\u8221\'20\'1D compared with the growth he expects in the next 20 years, as more and more Latin Americans gain access to the internet and broadband penetration deepens.\par \par \uc2 Despegar.com\par \par \uc2 Founded 1999\par \par \uc2 Genesis After meeting at Fuqua business school in the US, the founders put together the Despegar idea via email\par \par \uc2 Annual revenues $4bn\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.despegar.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Despegar.com  }}}\uc2 , from the verb \u8220\'20\'1Cto take off\u8221\'20\'1D, is Latin America\u8217\'20\'19s largest online travel agent and the fifth-largest in the world, operating throughout the region, as well as the US and Spain. Its biggest market is Brazil, where it has an important subsidiary, Decolar.com.\par \par \uc2 The site allows leisure and business travellers to research and book airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, holiday packages, cruises and tourist attractions. Expedia.com, the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest online travel agent, paid $270m last year for a 16 per cent stake, deepening a commercial relationship in which the two companies already shared customers.\par \par \uc2 Co-founder and chief executive Roberto Souviron recently announced plans to launch an IPO on Nasdaq by 2017, selling about 10 per cent of the company\u8217\'20\'19s shares.\par \par \uc2 Sales of $4bn are expected this year, but Souviron believes they could double over the next five years and triple over the next 10. Only a fifth of airline tickets are currently sold online in Latin America, compared with about half in the US. Like \uc2 MercadoLibre\uc2 , the company stands to benefit from increased and faster broadband access in the region.\par \par \uc2 OLX\par \par \uc2 Founded 2006\par \par \uc2 Genesis The co-founders first talked about the business while hiking Argentina\u8217\'20\'19s Perito Moreno glacier\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.olx.ph/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 OLX  }}}\uc2  is one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s leading online classifieds companies.

When \uc2 Naspers\uc2  consolidated its online classified services in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania under the OLX brand, OLX became one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest \uc2 internet brands\uc2  developed outside Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 The online platform for consumer-to-consumer trade is now used in more than 45 countries \u8212\'20\'14 mostly emerging rather than developed markets \u8212\'20\'14 and boasts more than 300m users every month.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160919ec9j001h0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Half of the 15,000 mutual funds in the US are run by portfolio managers who do not invest a single dollar of their own money in their products, raising concerns about whether fund managers\u8217\'20\'19 interests are properly aligned with those of their investors.\par \par \uc2 Many of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest asset managers, including \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 , \uc2 State Street\uc2 , \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  and Aberdeen, are among the companies with the lowest levels of portfolio manager investment in their funds.\par \par \uc2 Three out of four funds at \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 , the world\u8217\'20\'19s second-largest asset manager, and at \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , Europe\u8217\'20\'19s second-largest listed fund house, are run by managers who do not invest anything in their funds.\par \par \uc2 Portfolio managers are not invested in two out of three funds at \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest investment company, and at Aberdeen, the FTSE 250 fund company, according to figures compiled exclusively for FTfm by \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 , the data provider.\par \par \uc2 Only one of \uc2 State Street\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s 33 US-domiciled funds has a portfolio manager who is invested in their own product.\par \par \uc2 This raises concerns as large investors such as pension funds and institutional asset managers like to see fund managers invested in their own funds as it demonstrates they have skin in the game and will be personally affected by any downturn in a fund\u8217\'20\'19s performance.\par \par \uc2 Steve Deschenes, head of client \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at Capital Group, the Los Angeles-based investment company, said the findings are a worry. \u8220\'20\'1COf course you should invest in [your own] fund,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. Nearly 90 per cent of Capital Group\u8217\'20\'19s mutual funds are run by managers that invest at least $1m in their own products.\par \par \uc2 Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the asset management consultancy, said he expected manager investment levels to be higher. \u8220\'20\'1CSince the 2008 crisis, more asset managers have been revamping their incentive systems to encourage co-investing,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe rhetoric of the reported changes has been running ahead of the reality.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A number of smaller investment companies demonstrated much higher levels of skin in the game, including \uc2 Dodge & Cox\uc2 , Oakmark and Primecap Odyssey. One hundred per cent of these companies\u8217\'20\'19 funds had portfolio managers invested in them.\par \par \uc2 The data also showed that asset managers running funds with lower fees were more likely to invest in their own products, suggesting manager investment could lead to lower costs and better performance, according to Russel Kinnel, head of research at \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CFund managers are savvy investors, so they are less likely to invest in gimmicky, high-cost funds. I remember one firm telling us that they didn\u8217\'20\'19t invest much [in their own funds] because they would rather invest in something cheaper.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 According to Capital Group research published in 2014 looking at the performance of US mutual funds over 20 years, manager ownership and cost are the two characteristics most strongly correlated with improved returns.\par \par \uc2 Fewer than one in seven funds have managers with more than $1m invested, the \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  figures showed, despite the fact that annual salaries for fund managers are frequently in the millions of dollars, according to Mr Kinnel.\par \par \uc2 He added that it was surprising how many funds had zero levels of investment from their portfolio managers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe would have guessed that at least more [fund managers would invest] in those middle ranges of $50,000.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In Europe, rules that came into effect earlier this year require mutual fund managers to receive part of their bonuses as units of the funds they run. Mr Kinnel believes this change will have a spillover effect and pressure US fund managers to increase investments in their funds.\par \par \uc2 However, he said that similar rules were unlikely to be imposed in the US.\par \par \uc2 Fund companies argue that there are some situations where managers cannot invest in their own funds. UK-based \uc2 Schroders\uc2  said only a third of its 16 US-based mutual funds are managed by US-based portfolio managers who can invest directly in the products.\par \par \uc2 A spokesperson for BlackRock said: \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 Morningstar\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s most recent stewardship report on \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  makes clear that approximately 67 per cent of our US mutual fund assets are in vehicles in which at least one of the managers has invested $1m or more, including unvested fund shares. \uc2 Morningstar\uc2  has stated that it does not expect portfolio managers to invest in every target date fund or every municipal bond fund that they manage.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 T Rowe Price, which has no manager investment in 45 per cent of its funds, said personal investments \u8220\'20\'1Cmight not be practical\u8221\'20\'1D if a manager is not a US citizen or manages retirement-related funds of funds.\par \par \uc2 A spokesperson for Vanguard, which has no managers invested in 77 per cent of its funds, added that cost was a more important metric for investors than skin in the game.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020160918ec9i000gq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Investors have been targeting "male, stale and frail" boards, worrying that entrenched directors are failing to hold management teams accountable.\par \par \uc2 Shareholder concerns about Wells' culture and governance have risen after regulators said last week that employees trying to meet sales targets may have signed up more than 2m customers for accounts and credit cards without their knowledge. The bank said it had fired about 5,300 employees in response.\par \par \uc2 Mr Armstrong said: "How can they argue against my proposal now? Where is the board? Where is the audit committee of the board? It appears they go to the meetings, they pick up their cheques and they go home."\par \par \uc2 An FT analysis of data from the shareholder adviser ISS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  found that Wells has some of the oldest and longest-serving directors among the 17 US banks with more than $100bn in assets.\par \par \uc2 Only two banks - \uc2 Capital One\uc2  and M & T - have board members whose average tenure is longer than the 9.7 years average at Wells. The average age of a Wells director is 64.5; at only four other banks is it higher. Wells does have a more gender-diverse board than all the other banks, however: six of its 15 directors are women.\par \par \uc2 The bank declined to comment on the findings. In response to Mr Armstrong's motion to separate the chairman and chief executive roles this year, the bank said its governance structure already provided effective independent oversight of management. "If adopted, the proposal would unnecessarily restrict the board's ability to select the director best suited to serve as chairman," it said.\par \par \uc2 John Stumpf\uc2  , who became chief executive in 2007 and added the chairmanship in 2010, has put himself forward as the public face of the bank as it tries to regain trust .\par \par \uc2 In a note to customers this week, he wrote: "Every day we strive to get things right. In this instance we did not - and that is simply not acceptable."\par \par \uc2 CtW Investments, which represents union-backed pension funds in the US, said it would support splitting the two top roles. Dieter Waizenegger, its executive director, said: "The wheels have fallen off the wagon at \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , and the oversight of an independent board chair could help repair the bank's broken compliance systems. Shareholders should re-evaluate the effectiveness of the audit, risk, and corporate responsibility committees, in particular."\par \par \uc2 The board's lead director, the former \uc2 General Mills\uc2  chairman \uc2 Stephen Sanger\uc2 , has sat on the Wells board for 13 years. He chairs the bank's governance and nominating committee.\par \par \uc2 Susan Swenson\uc2 , the Novatel Wireless chief, and \uc2 Susan Engel\uc2 , former head of the second hand luxury retailer Portero, have been directors since 1998.\par \par \uc2 More recent appointees include \uc2 Federico Pe\u241\'00\'F1a\uc2 , a former energy and transport secretary under Bill Clinton, who became a Wells director in 2011. The Texan chairs the corporate responsibility committee, which has a remit to "monitor the Company's reputation generally, including with customers".\par \par \uc2 James Quigley\uc2 , a retired Deloitte partner who leads the audit and examination committee, joined the board in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Banking industry scandals and problems have put a focus on the combined chairman and chief executive role in the past. In 2009, when \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 's Ken Lewis was under fire for his handling of the acquisition of \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2 , investors voted to separate the roles, in effect stripping him of the chairmanship.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160915ec9f0001v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But it warned that 6-12 per cent of revenues were at risk of digital disruption.\par \par \uc2 The report cited the example of an investment bank that used the increased computing capacity of a cloud service to cut the time needed for working out a derivatives pricing grid from eight hours to only 15 minutes and slashed the cost to under $10.\par \par \uc2 Matthieu Lemerle, head of McKinsey's corporate and investment banking practice, said: "The toolkit is getting richer and the willingness of banks to embrace things they never would have done in the past is really happening."\par \par \uc2 The report, based on data from 175 banks and interviews with 200 executives, predicted that digitisation could cut a quarter of the sector's cost base.\par \par \uc2 It concluded that the new "fintech" start-ups were mostly potential partners rather than threats for investment banks and a third of the sector has taken a minority stake in at least one fintech.\par \par \uc2 The potential upside of technology was a rare bright spot in an otherwise bleak report for the sector. Return on equity in the sector averaged 10 per cent, unchanged from the previous year.\par \par \uc2 But the 10 biggest banks underperformed, achieving an average of only 7 per cent return on equity - below their cost of capital. This was mostly because of their much higher ratio of costs to income, which was 76 per cent, against 64 per cent for the overall sector. Revenues fell for the third straight year at the top 10 groups.\par \par \uc2 The five big European investment banks had average return on equity of 5 per cent - half that of their five biggest US rivals - mainly because of the drag from the non-core units that most of them are looking to offload or close.\par \par \uc2 McKinsey identified the fixed income, currency and commodities sector as the main drag on performance. FICC trading slumped from producing 61 per cent of overall revenues for the top 10 groups in 2010 to only 46 per cent last year.\par \par \uc2 Totting up the likely impact of all upcoming regulation for the sector, McKinsey estimated it would cut the overall return on equity of the sector in half, if no mitigating action was taken. It said market risk-weighted assets would rise from $650bn last year to more than $1tn by 2020, under the incoming rules.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160915ec9f00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 It looks like 2017 will be ObamaCare's worst year yet. America's three major insurers, along with many smaller plans, are largely exiting the health-insurance exchanges, leaving more than half of U.S. counties with only one or two health-plan choices, according to the \uc2 Kaiser Family Foundation\uc2 . Nearly 36% of ObamaCare regions may have only one participating insurance carrier offering plans for 2017, according to health-care \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 Avalere Health\uc2 . Data from analysts at \uc2 Barclays\uc2  and \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  project that health-insurance premiums are expected to rise at least 24% in 2017.\par \par \uc2 To rescue President Obama's health-care law, \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  has proposed resurrecting the "public option." This failed idea -- a government-run health-care plan to compete with private insurers -- can't save ObamaCare. But introducing it across the country would move the U.S. much closer to the single-payer system progressives have always longed for.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Clinton positions the states as vehicles for the public option, and this isn't because she discovered a late-in-life appreciation for federalism. Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act, a little-known provision, allows states to renounce almost all of ObamaCare's dictates. That includes the law's politically sacred rules governing the medical benefits consumers are promised and the subsidy structure that helps pay for them. States only need to develop alternative schemes that can achieve the same level of similarly priced coverage that they would attain under ordinary ObamaCare.\par \par \uc2 In 2011 Vermont tried to use this waiver process to introduce a public option, only to abandon it three years later when it became clear that the scheme would yield skyrocketing taxes on small businesses. Maine, Minnesota and Rhode Island are proposing variations of this scheme for implementation after 2017. Maine's proposed law boasts of its intent to use "federal funds to the maximum extent allowable under federal law." Colorado is using the 1332 waiver to pursue its own single payer through an initiative on the ballot this November.\par \par \uc2 The real juice is the funding. To pay for these schemes, the 1332 waivers let states pocket the aggregate subsidies -- including premium tax credits, cost-sharing subsidies, and small-business tax credits -- that they would otherwise receive under ObamaCare. This federal slush fund could give states billions of dollars annually to subsidize their own publicly run health plan.\par \par \uc2 The process gives the executive branch broad authority to coax or even coerce states to pursue the creation of these public options -- without congressional consent. ObamaCare requires that any new scheme be "deficit neutral" relative to the cost of the law. So long as the new public option won't add to ObamaCare's costs, the state can use the law's subsidies to pay for government-run plans. The waivers give states ample ability to use savings claimed by setting price controls on medical care as a way to meet the budget goals.\par \par \uc2 Federal regulators would approve new public options based on White House budget-office estimates of the program's cost and impact on a state's existing insurance market. The Obama administration has abused this broad discretion before: Officials manipulated "budget neutrality" by allowing states like Arkansas to expand their Medicaid programs under ObamaCare.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Government Accountability Office\uc2  in 2014 criticized the Obama administration over its "lack of transparency in the basis for approved spending limits" and "assurances that demonstrations would be budget-neutral to the federal government." It is hard to imagine that a Clinton White House would be any more responsible.\par \par \uc2 Minnesota provides an example for how this might work. The state already pushes Medicaid enrollees into one of the state-directed Medicaid HMOs. Under one of the state's new proposals, it could use the 1332 waiver to market similar low-cost plans on the ObamaCare exchange. The Minnesota scheme could use the state's existing Medicaid price schedule to set provider rates under this public option.\par \par \uc2 Forcing providers to accept Medicaid-like rates could make these state-run public options an ostensibly cheaper alternative to the current ObamaCare plans. The end result? A federally subsidized, single-payer health-care system run by the states -- complete with government authority to set prices. These government plans would have so many competitive advantages through federal subsidies and price setting that they would force the private plans out of the exchange market.\par \par \uc2 ObamaCare used the law's vast authority to get control over the design and composition of health benefits. ClintonCare will try to use these same administrative riggings to get power over the pricing of these products and services. After moderate Democrats came out against the public option, it seemed like it would never be ushered into law. Yet the policy doesn't need congressional approval. Mrs. Clinton apparently understands the law's vices better than those who voted for it.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Dr. Gottlieb is a physician and resident fellow at the \uc2 American Enterprise Institute\uc2 .

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 A new species is prowling America's most obscure industry conferences: the data hunter.\par \par \uc2 Erik Haines, head of data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at New York-based \uc2 Guidepoint Global LLC\uc2 , trawls the globe for meaningful data to sell to hedge-fund clients. One of his best strategies is to attend the most seemingly mundane gatherings, such as the Association for Healthcare Resource & Materials Management conference in San Diego last year, and the National Industrial Transportation League event in New Orleans.\par \par \uc2 "I walk the floor, try to talk to companies and get a sense within an industry of who collects data that could provide a unique insight into that industry," he said.\par \par \uc2 Hedge funds and other sophisticated investors are increasingly relying on intermediaries like Mr. Haines, 35 years old, as they seek insights into a company's sales and health that aren't readily available from conventional sources.\par \par \uc2 The information ranges from crop yields calculated by satellite images and linguistic analyses of speeches by CEOs to credit-card transactions and monitoring of sentiment about companies on social media.\par \par \uc2 The accuracy of this data is a subject of debate within the investment world, with some arguing the information is based around samples riddled with biases and errors.\par \par \uc2 Data hunters scour the business world for companies that have data useful for predicting the stock prices of other companies.\par \par \uc2 For instance, a company that processes transactions at stores could have market-moving information on how certain products or brands are selling or a company that provides software to hospitals could give insights into how specific medical devices are being used.\par \par \uc2 Gone are the days when a hedge fund would call up a random sampling of \uc2 Aeropostale\uc2  stores to ask managers about sales or simply visit big-box retailers to get a feel for the traffic.\par \par \uc2 In one recent example, Mr. Haines discovered a mobile advertising company that also collected data on the type of device someone was using when displaying an ad to them. The data helped estimate iPhone sales ahead of \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 .'s announcements in 2011 and 2012, and it was lucrative for Mr. Haines's old company, Quanton Data.\par \par \uc2 He and the team from Quanton joined Guidepoint, a company that has traditionally provided experts and survey data to customers, earlier this summer.\par \par \uc2 Some hedge funds have built data-hunting teams internally, especially so-called quants whose strategies rely entirely on finding patterns in large sets of data. Quants typically analyze market data -- prices and volume over time -- but increasingly are taking those skills to this type of data, which is called "exhaust," because it is a secondary result of a company's main business.\par \par \uc2 WorldQuant LLC, a quantitative hedge fund based in Connecticut, has a team that reviews hundreds of data sets a year and works to bring online as many as possible that provide some value, according to a person familiar with its strategy. Its staff of scientists and mathematicians then go to work on the data to see if it helps predict revenues at companies or other market phenomena.\par \par \uc2 A host of startups also are trying to make it easier for funds without high-powered data-science staffers to get the same insights. One, called Quandl Inc., based in Toronto, offers a platform that includes traditional market data alongside several "alternative" data.\par \par \uc2 "The opportunity we are chasing is that in all this huge data there are little nuggets of alpha gold," said Tammer Kamel, its founder and CEO.\par \par \uc2 The firm struck a deal with a large insurance company to find out every day what kinds of cars received insurance policies, a possible indicator of how sales are going for automobile manufacturers.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20160914000047"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020160914ec9e00019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The group, led by 14-year industry veteran Margaret Dechant, is reaching out to their \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  clients to transfer most of the more than $2.2 billion in assets that they managed there.\par \par \uc2 Most of 6 Meridian's clients are business owners, corporate executives and medical professionals, and the firm has focused on building in-house portfolios for those investors. As a stand-alone firm, 6 Meridian will be able to expand its investment offerings and conduct due diligence on products and offerings that may not have been possible under a big brokerage like \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , executives of the new venture say.\par \par \uc2 A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman confirmed the departures but declined to comment further.\par \par \uc2 -- Michael Wursthorn\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 E*TRADE\par \par \uc2 CEO Is Replaced\par \par \uc2 E*Trade Financial Corp\uc2 . shook up its executive ranks in an effort to make its brokerage business more competitive, a move that comes as the online financial-services firm looks to move beyond several years of postcrisis retrenching.\par \par \uc2 E*Trade\uc2  unveiled several top-level executive changes Monday, including the departure of Chief Executive Paul Idzik, who had been in the post since January 2013.\par \par \uc2 Karl Roessner\uc2 , previously the firm's general counsel, will succeed Mr. Idzik as CEO, the firm said. Mr. Roessner has been with \uc2 E*Trade\uc2  since 2007, before mortgage exposure upended the firm during the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Idzik couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 The firm also said it has brought back Michael Curcio, who had served as E*Trade's president before he left the company in 2013, as chief brokerage officer.\par \par \uc2 -- Daisy Maxey\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 VENTURE CAPITAL\par \par \uc2 China's Sinovation\par \par \uc2 Raises $674 Million\par \par \uc2 A Chinese venture-capital fund raised about 4.5 billion yuan, or about $674 million, in capital as the country's top venture firms build up their cash piles amid a cooling environment for funding.\par \par \uc2 Sinovation Ventures, co-founded by former \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . executive Kai-Fu Lee, said it closed two venture-capital funds: a dollar-denominated fund of $300 million -- in which \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . supplier \uc2 Foxconn Technology Group\uc2  was the anchor investor -- and a yuan-denominated fund totaling the equivalent of $374 million.\par \par \uc2 It plans to invest the funds raised in startup companies involved in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , building enterprise software and creating entertainment content.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, Chinese venture-capital firms have reined in investing after a frantic 2015. Valuations are falling, and some startups are struggling to find investment. But top venture firms still are able to raise money because returns from other assets have been disappointing.\par \par \uc2 "We still see many good ideas and trends to invest in," Mr. Lee said.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MORGAN STANLEY\par \par \uc2 Wealth-Management Staff Form Own Firm\par \par \uc2 More than a dozen \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  employees have left the bank's wealth-management unit to launch their own practice, the latest group of financial veterans to bolt from big, traditional brokerages in favor of independent investment-advisory firms.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's Kirk Bahm Group, in Wichita, Kan., said it resigned this month to form investment-advisory firm 6 Meridian LLC. The group, led by 14-year industry veteran Margaret Dechant, is reaching out to their \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  clients to transfer most of the more than $2.2 billion in assets that they managed there.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Dechant said the "complexity and needs" of their clients and the "distractions of a larger firm" drove them to launch 6 Meridian.\par \par \uc2 Most of 6 Meridian's clients are business owners, corporate executives and medical professionals, and the firm has focused on building in-house portfolios for those investors. As a stand-alone firm, 6 Meridian will be able to expand its investment offerings and conduct due diligence on products and offerings that may not have been possible under a big brokerage like \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , executives of the new venture say.\par \par \uc2 "Every investment option, investment manager and investment style has to be vetted by a big committee" at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , said Thomas Kirk III, a 35-year broker who is now a senior managing director at 6 Meridian. "We're much more nimble."\par \par \uc2 A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman confirmed the departures but declined to comment further.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Michael Wursthorn\par \par \uc2 CARLYLE GROUP\par \par \uc2 New Hire to Oversee Investing in Debt\par \par \uc2 Carlyle Group LP\uc2  hired a senior executive from Canada's biggest pension fund to oversee debt investing, part of the asset manager's effort to regroup from setbacks in its credit and hedge-fund business.\par \par \uc2 Washington-based Carlyle tapped \uc2 Mark Jenkins\uc2 , most recently head of global private investments at the \uc2 Canada Pension Plan Investment Board\uc2 , for the newly created position.\par \par \uc2 The hire follows a series of setbacks in Carlyle's global-market-strategies arm, which encompasses much of the firm's investing outside of private equity and real estate. The unit has been a sore spot for Carlyle largely because of struggles at its hedge funds \uc2 Claren Road Asset Management\uc2 , Vermillion Asset Management LLC and Emerging Sovereign Group LLC. Like its peers, the firm has expanded beyond its roots in corporate buyouts over the years, seeking to diversify, boost assets and appeal to shareholders following its 2012 initial public offering.\par \par \uc2 Overall, global market strategies' funds have fallen in four quarters in a row, including a 12% decline in the first three months of the year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jenkins is focusing on the unit's credit investing, which includes energy lending, providing capital to midsize companies and bets on distressed debt.\par \par \uc2 Matt Jarzemsky\par \par \uc2 REGULATION\par \par \uc2 Aberdeen Is Told To Boost Its Capital\par \par \uc2 The U.K.'s financial watchdog has told \uc2 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC\uc2  to increase the capital buffer it holds by \u163\'00\'A3140 million ($186 million), signaling greater scrutiny of the fund-management sector.\par \par \uc2 Aberdeen, which manages a little more than \u163\'00\'A3300 billion in assets, said its total regulatory capital requirement now will be around \u163\'00\'A3475 million. Its shares, which are down 37% since April 2015, fell 1.7% to 320.10 pence.\par \par \uc2 The fund-management sector has been under scrutiny since the U.K.'s vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  in June, and the action by the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  has raised concerns that other fund-management firms will have to follow suit.\par \par \uc2 Aberdeen said it had volunteered to set aside \u163\'00\'A3100 million before the \uc2 FCA\uc2 's request, taking its previous reserved position to \u163\'00\'A3435 million. Analysts don't believe the higher requirement will impair prospects for dividends paid by the asset-management firm.\par \par \uc2 Mike Foster\uc2 , Laurence Fletcher\par \par \uc2 VENTURE CAPITAL\par \par \uc2 China's Sinovation Raises $674 Million\par \par \uc2 A Chinese venture-capital fund raised about 4.5 billion yuan, or about $674 million, in capital as the country's top venture firms build up their cash piles amid a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startups-face-dwindling-funding-1473263749"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cooling environment for funding}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sinovation Ventures, co-founded by former \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . executive Kai-Fu Lee, said it closed two venture-capital funds: a dollar-denominated fund of $300 million\u8212\'20\'14in which \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . supplier \uc2 Foxconn Technology Group\uc2  was the anchor investor\u8212\'20\'14and a yuan-denominated fund totaling the equivalent of $374 million.\par \par \uc2 It plans to invest the funds raised in startup companies involved in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , building enterprise software and creating entertainment content.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, Chinese venture-capital firms have reined in investing after a frantic 2015. Valuations are falling, and some startups are struggling to find investment. But top venture firms still are able to raise money because returns from other assets have been disappointing. "We still see many good ideas and trends to invest in," Mr. Lee said. "High-quality startups won't be cheap and will require a lot of investment as they grow."\par \par \uc2 Sinovation Ventures, formerly known as China's Innovation Works, is among the most aggressive Chinese {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-gears-up-in-artificial-intelligence-race-1472054254"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 venture funds betting on startups that use \\b artificial-intelligence\\b0  technology}}}\uc2  to develop products from driverless cars to enterprise software.\par \par \uc2 It has invested $100 million in 25 such companies in the U.S. and China in the past three years.\par \par \uc2 Li Yuan\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160913ec9c002jp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Global Logistic Properties Ltd\uc2 . said it has agreed to buy distribution centers from \uc2 Hillwood Development Co\uc2 . for $1.1 billion.\par \par \uc2 GLP, a large industrial property company part-owned by Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, has been aggressively expanding in the U.S. over the last two years, as the rise of online shopping drives up the values of distribution centers.\par \par \uc2 The Hillwood portfolio, with 15 million square feet, solidifies GLP's position as the second-largest owner of warehouses in the U.S., after San Francisco-based real-estate investment trust \uc2 Prologis Inc\uc2 . Upon completion of the deal, GLP will own nearly 200 million square feet of warehouse property in the U.S., compared with about 325 million for Prologis.\par \par \uc2 Hillwood, which is controlled by \uc2 Ross Perot Jr\uc2 ., a Dallas-based property investor and son of the former U.S. presidential candidate, is selling properties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Chicago.\par \par \uc2 The largest tenants in the portfolio are \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Starbucks Corp\uc2 ., NFI, \uc2 Williams-Sonoma Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Wayfair Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Charles Sullivan, GLP's chief operating officer, said the purchase reflects the rising importance of online shopping, which has shortened delivery times for consumer products and forced retailers to offer more shipping options to customers.\par \par \uc2 "There was a time when warehousing and distribution was just another part of the supply chain," Mr. Sullivan said. "Logistics\u8230\'20\'26has moved up in its importance in corporate strategy. The customer is more a part of the distribution than they were 10 or 15 years ago."\par \par \uc2 Deal-making in the real-estate sector has slowed from its record pace last year. Investors bought nearly $78 billion worth of warehouses and distribution centers in 2015, according to data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Through July of this year, however, only $29.2 billion worth of industrial property had changed hands, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 GLP has been one of the market's biggest buyers in recent years, including its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/global-logistic-properties-to-buy-200-u-s-warehouses-for-4-6-billion-1438128162"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $4.6 billion purchase of 200 U.S. warehouses}}}\uc2  from Industrial Income Trust in 2015 and its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-reaches-agreement-to-sell-indcorp-to-asian-venture-for-8-1-billion-1417473843"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $8.1 billion purchase}}}\uc2  of \uc2 IndCor Properties\uc2 , a large portfolio owned by \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2  in late 2014. Most of the company's properties are in Asia.\par \par \uc2 In April of last year, Prologis announced its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/prologis-to-buy-ktr-capital-for-5-9-billion-1429464155"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $5.9 billion purchase}}}\uc2  of \uc2 KTR Capital Partners\uc2 , another large warehouse owner.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say the rush for property in 2015 was the result of investors looking for alternatives to low bond-market yields amid a surfeit of large industrial property portfolios arranged during the real-estate downturn that followed the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. After a spate of blockbuster deals, there are fewer large portfolios for sale.\par \par \uc2 Last year was "the busiest year in history in terms of pure acquisitions," said Eric Frankel, an analyst with \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 . "The challenge to industrial real estate is that it's a low cost-per-square-foot business, and it takes a lot of time to assemble a big enough portfolio to interest large institutional investors. You are seeing a lot of smaller portfolios out there."\par \par \uc2 Like many real-estate firms, GLP raises funds from large institutional investors, then uses a mix of those funds and debt to buy and manage properties, while keeping a small equity stake for themselves. For most of its U.S. deals, GLP retains around a 10% stake in the properties after it buys them.\par \par \uc2 The latest GLP deal is expected to close in two rounds: acquisition of about two-thirds of the property will be completed in December, while the remainder will close in the next 18 to 24 months. The warehouses in the first round of closings are 100% leased, while the second round of closings is contingent on a full lease-up the properties.\par \par \uc2 Write to Robbie Whelan at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:robbie.whelan@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 robbie.whelan@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160912ec9c00bq9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Marketers have so many software programs at their fingertips that they need a software program to keep them all straight, according to Datorama Chief Executive and co-founder Ran Sarig.\par \par \uc2 New York-based Datorama, maker of an integration engine for marketing \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  from multiple sources, has raised a $32 million Series C round led by \uc2 Lightspeed Venture Partners\uc2 . Marker LLC and Innovation Endeavors, the investment vehicle of Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, also participated as returning investors.\par \par \uc2 "We're thinking there's much more to be done with all the data that's mashed together for every single marketer," said Mr. Sarig. He said the company is working to expand the product's \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  capabilities.\par \par \uc2 Datorama will use the new funding to hire people in research and development, customer success, accounts management and marketing, Mr. Sarig said. The company has about 160 employees. By the end of next year, Mr. Sarig said he plans to have about 270.\par \par \uc2 Datorama's customers include \uc2 Foursquare\uc2 , \uc2 L'Or\u233\'00\'E9al\uc2 , GoDaddy and \uc2 Yahoo Japan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The round gives Datorama a total of $50 million raised.

Earlier that month, Thoma Bravo said it was acquiring supply-chain operating network company \uc2 Elemica Inc\uc2 . as well as Canada's auto marketplace and software provider \uc2 Trader Corp\uc2 . for $1.58 billion Canadian dollars from \uc2 Apax Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bravo said roughly 30% of its new fund has been invested\u8212\'20\'14including the deals for Qlik, Trader and \uc2 Imprivata\uc2 . He said the firm's previous flagship fund is substantially invested at this time.\par \par \uc2 A number of pensions have committed to Thoma Bravo's new flagship fund. The \uc2 New York State Common Retirement Fund\uc2  noted that it had committed $400 million to the vehicle, according to a monthly transaction report from the pension. \uc2 New York State Teachers' Retirement System\uc2  committed up to $200 million to the fund and Los Angeles City Employees' Retirement System committed up to $25 million, according to memos by the pensions\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, the firm said it raised $1.07 billion for its stand-alone, lower midmarket, software-focused vehicle, Thoma Bravo Discover Fund LP. The fund makes equity investments of up to $150 million and targets companies with annual revenue of $30 million to $150 million.

MOSKOW\uc2 : All right. We're all set. Lael, thank you so much for those comments. Very thoughtful speech. Gives us all a great deal to think about.\par \par \uc2 So let me\u8212\'20\'14as you know, we'll have a little discussion here and then we'll open up for questions from the audience. Let me start with the forecast, because people may not realize it but the ability of the Fed to forecast the economy is extremely important, because when you formulate monetary policy you're looking ahead, not in the past. And you got to decide whether to influence monetary policy in the future. Well, the Fed forecast, as well as a lot of private sector forecasters, have been consistently off in\u8212\'20\'14for the last five, six years. They've over-forecasted output. They've under-forecasted the rate at which the unemployment rate would come down. And they've over-forecasted inflation as well. And as I said, it's not just the Fed, but private sector forecasters too. Why do you think this is?\par \par \uc2 LAEL BRAINARD\uc2 : Well, so I think over the course of the recovery there are a variety of reasons that the actual economy has underperformed the forecast on aggregate growth. The first is, of course, that the financial crisis was extraordinarily deep, and that it was a period when households experienced very severe losses in their balance sheets. And it has taken a long time for households to rebuild some economic security, for credit conditions to turn to more normal. So that is one of the reasons, is that the return from very deep financial crises often gets slower relative to other kinds of cyclical recoveries.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Slower than forecasted?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Slower than forecasted, relative to previous recoveries.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, there have been a series of very significant foreign shocks that had not been anticipated in some of those earlier forecasts and, indeed, have not been anticipated in subsequent forecasts as well. Japan, as I stated earlier, is extremely weakened, has been dealing with some of its own challenges. The euro area has experienced a number of periods of extreme financial volatility and has undergone a financial crisis that has taken a different path than in the United States. And of course, the source of strength that was previously emerging market growth has also most recently been a source of volatility and downward drag on the U.S. And I described that in some detail, but of course China has been a big factor most recently. So those are the first two things.\par \par \uc2 But third, potential growth has also come in consistently below what was anticipated. So if you look at (\uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2 ) numbers on potential growth, it has declined from about 2.6% (annually), according to CBO estimates prior to the crisis, to about 1.4% subsequent to the crisis. And that in turn reflects a few things\u8212\'20\'14first of all, labor market slowing that was greater than anticipated. Now, obviously, some of the retirement of the baby boom generation was well-anticipated, but in fact participation rates dropped more, particularly among prime-age workers, than had been anticipated. And again, this is the reason that there may be more slack there than we had anticipated. And secondly, productivity growth has been much lower than was anticipated. And there, there are a variety of explanations that have been given, but I don't think anybody fully understands that phenomenon yet.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: OK, so this potential growth was a very key concept because, as you said, it reflects the growth of the labor force and the growth of productivity at the same time. So just on the labor force side, you mentioned in your comments that you think there's room for further\u8212\'20\'14there's further slack here. But actually, there are a couple of indicators that show that the labor market's really quite tight now. The unemployment rate's 4.9%. But job openings are extremely high now. The number of unemployed people per job opening is very low now. And as you said, the participation rate for prime-age males is low. Why is that? What's happening here? Do you have a\u8212\'20\'14can you help us understand these apparent contradictions here?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I think, you know, if we\u8212\'20\'14if we perfectly understood the reasons for the lower prime-age labor participation rate I think that would help us a great deal in being much more precise about what the estimate of natural\u8212\'20\'14the natural rate of unemployment is. But of course, we don't\u8212\'20\'14we don't know that with certainty. What we do know is that the rate of labor-force participation has been quite elevated\u8212\'20\'14and for the prime-age workers\u8212\'20\'14quite elevated throughout the recovery. And it's really only very recently that we've seen a half-percentage-point increase in that prime-age labor-force participation rate, which I think is a positive development.\par \par \uc2 And yet, even with that, we're 1 \u189\'00\'BD percentage points below where we were pre-crisis. Now, it may be that it takes a while after a very scarring downturn for people to be brought back into the labor force. And in fact, that's part of the reason that we've seen the unemployment rate moving sideways, as the jobs numbers have been quite robust in the recent months, is because people are coming in who had left the labor force and are coming back in. And it may simply be that it took a while for the labor market to be sufficiently promising for some of those former workers to be brought back in.\par \par \uc2 As we were noting earlier, wage inflation is really very subdued. It's really only picked up to the 2 \u189\'00\'BD% level, which is well-below what one would have expected pre-crisis. Job openings, as you say, have been elevated. But there are different kinds of ways that people post job openings. And so there are a lot of speculation around whether that number is the same number as we may have been looking at pre-crisis. And how do we compare those? So it's a kind of rich data picture which, at least in my case, leads me to conclude that there may well be additional slack, and that given the variety of reasons that we will expect inflation pressures to be quite moderate and slow, that that gives us some space to continue reducing the slack in the labor market.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: And on the participation rate side, of course, we had a real ramp up in female participation, which is very positive, and then leveled off. But male participation has had a long-term steady decline. Have you any thoughts as to why that's occurring?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I\u8212\'20\'14you know, I talk to a lot of labor market economists about that question. And I\u8212\'20\'14you know, I can't offer any particular pieces of research that you're not well-familiar with. But again, my sense is that there may well be a part of that that is a response to a deeply scarring financial crisis, and that we still have some room to go in drawing some of the prime-age labor force male and female back into work. And of course, that matters, not just for growth, but that matters for the long-term productive potential of the economy, as well as for the well-being of those individuals and their families.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Right. Now, it's very important\u8212\'20\'14and of course, the decline in male participation goes back way before the financial crisis. It's a long-term trend that no one can seem to explain. The other part of potential growth that you referred to, of course, is productivity growth, which is so important to raising our standard of living\u8212\'20\'14the amount of output per unit of input or per worker. And you mentioned you didn't have any good\u8212\'20\'14you hadn't been satisfied with the types of explanations you've heard as to why productivity growth has slowed. But have you any thoughts as to what could be done at this point to increase productivity growth?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Well, so the numbers there are really very stark\u8212\'20\'14you know, upwards of 2% productivity growth in the 50 years right up to 2000, and now since the crisis, we have\u8212\'20\'14in the last five years we have only half a percentage point per year, one percentage point if you look over 10 years. There are a variety of hypotheses out there and a lot of interesting research.\par \par \uc2 You know, there is a hypothesis that we had very elevated productivity growth for a very short period of time, and that that innovation has now been fully absorbed, and therefore this is a return to sort of pre-'90s normal. That's one hypothesis.\par \par \uc2 Another hypothesis is that, for a variety of reasons, in part because of the\u8212\'20\'14or primarily because of the financial crisis, that credit conditions were particularly daunting. For a period of time the rate of business startups fell considerably, and the adoption of some of the very promising technologies has been very slow. So there are good technologies out there, according to that story, but that the adoption of them, you know, has been slowed by these factors. You know, people point to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , for instance, or robotics. In that latter set of explanations, you would actually expect to see productivity starting to rise again as business dynamism increases because credit conditions are better and adoption is more widespread.\par \par \uc2 I will say the only other piece of information that seems important, as well, is that this phenomena is not confined to the United States; that productivity growth has slowed globally, and in fact more so in other parts of the world.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the kinds of things that policy makers can do, there are probably very important things that sit with Congress and the executive branch having to do with a whole host of policies\u8212\'20\'14infrastructure investment, R&D, education, worker training. But again, those are policies that really sit with the executive branch and Congress, state and local governments in some cases.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Would you add government regulation to that list, too?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Absolutely. More efficient and effective regulation is also part of that list.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: What about business investment? That's a key ingredient here, too, in increasing productivity, and business investment has been incredibly slow, even negative, in some quarters for about a year now. Any thoughts as to why this is occurring?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So one of the factors that clearly has been weighing on business investment\u8212\'20\'14at least for the past three quarters when, as you've said, we've seen negative business investment\u8212\'20\'14has been the run-up in the exchange rate. Another factor that was important early on in that period was the sharp decrease in the price of oil. We saw very sharp drops in drilling and investment in mining. And we have subsequently seen business investment more broadly being impacted. You see it on corporate profitability, particularly of businesses that are internationally oriented. And you see it particularly in the manufacturing sector. So clearly some of the forces that have been weighing on business investment have been global in nature, but there's still a question about having a more supportive environment for business investment domestically. And again, I'm hoping to see some of those numbers looking better in the third quarter.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: We all hope they look better. (Chuckles.)\par \par \uc2 Let me shift a bit to financial stability, which is an important concern of the-- of the Fed, along with its other objectives of maximum growth and price stability. But (Fed Chairwoman) \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  said recently that keeping interest rates at zero for an extended period of time might encourage excessive risk-taking and undermine financial stability. So doesn't this risk increase every year that interest rates are so low? And how do you balance this risk against the objectives which you've talked about, about growth and price stability?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Yeah. So I think in a low neutral rate environment, one of the issues that will be with us for some time is this question of reach-for-yield behavior and whether we will see some development of financial imbalances with potential stability risks.\par \par \uc2 Now, we at the Board\u8212\'20\'14at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Board\uc2  have, in the wake of the crisis, put in place a much more systematic set of mechanisms, both to monitor some of these kinds of financial stability risks with a new division that is devoted to that, with a quarterly assessment which systematically looks at places where asset valuations might be out of line with historical norms, where leverage might be building, the kinds of that we saw going into the crisis that should have been flashing yellow. And in addition, we have a whole set of strengthened authorities to deal with the potential for asset valuations to get out of whack, and for leverage and maturity transformation to start to build. Obviously, in our supervisory tool kit, apart from the leverage ratio and massively enhanced capital requirements, liquidity requirements, we also have what I think of as extraordinarily useful stress tests that in particular focus on the largest institutions that might pose systemic risks, that are core to the system, and really runs them through very vigorous forward-looking scenarios, which\u8212\'20\'14and asks them to hold capital and liquidity against those scenarios. But we also have now a countercyclical buffer, and the guidance on that went out last week\u8212\'20\'14or we have the framework to put in place, if needed, a countercyclical capital buffer. So we've got a whole host of augmented authorities.\par \par \uc2 And you know, we have, in fact, when we've seen some excesses building, we've issued guidance and we've seen some impact there. So if you look at the leveraged lending guidance that we put out in 2013, subsequent to that we actually did see underwriting standards tighten in the supervised banking system. And more recently, at the end of last year, we put out guidance because we were concerned about some signs of building excesses in the commercial real-estate sector. And there, too, we've already seen in some of our lending surveys that underwriting standards have tightened.\par \par \uc2 But to come back to your earlier question, absolutely, in a low neutral rate environment we have to be attentive to the potential for these risks. On the other hand, the kind of low-inflation, low-growth, low-expectations environment that I was describing that some other countries have been grappling with is also an environment that is perilous for financial stability. So it's very important for us to avoid that as well.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: But the longer you keep\u8212\'20\'14I don't want to put words in your mouth, but the longer you keep interest rates so low, isn't the risk greater?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: I think the real question here is, if you're in an environment where the neutral rate is likely to remain low, and persistently so, that those kinds of reach-for-yield behaviors are ones that you need to be extra-attentive to.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Mmm hmm. One area is commercial real estate. A number of people have expressed concern about excesses in commercial real estate. Do you have any thoughts on that?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So we have\u8212\'20\'14in our surveillance exercises, that was a risk that we were picking up. We were seeing a lot of activity in that. Not as leveraged as you would have seen going into the crisis, but certainly the capitalization ratios there were of some concern. And so we did issue some guidance at the end of last year, obviously, to the institutions that we supervise in collaboration with the other bank regulators, and we've begun to see already that underwriting standards have tightened in response to that guidance. Again, it's within the supervised banking sector, but we have started to see some response already to that guidance. And we are going to keep a very close eye on those developments.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: So you're monitoring it carefully.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Very carefully.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: OK. Just thinking of the tools that central bankers are using these days, they're really extraordinarily different than 10 years ago. You have the (\uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 ) is buying corporate bonds now. You've got the \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2  is buying equities. The Fed now has a $4 trillion balance sheet, probably four times higher than it would have been under normal circumstances.\par \par \uc2 You're turning over to the Treasury about a hundred billion dollars a year, that's real money, a hundred billion (dollars) compared to maybe 20 or 25 (billion dollars) in earlier years.\par \par \uc2 Are you concerned about the unintended consequences of these extraordinary actions by these central banks?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So certainly the unconventional policies, asset purchases and forward guidance, that were used by the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , you know, we have closely studied them. There's been a lot of research. And the research, I think, concludes that they work through much the same channels as conventional monetary policy in terms of reducing interest rates and helping to support credit and aggregate demand generally.\par \par \uc2 But it is, of course, true that unconventional policies as well as some of the policies that have been undertaken by foreign central banks, that the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  has not engaged in, you know, they're less well-tested, they're, therefore, less well-understood.\par \par \uc2 And so I think in the U.S. context there was a careful consideration of both the benefits and the potential risks. And I'm sure that is also true in other countries, as against, of course, the benefits and costs of not taking all the actions necessary to provide a robust response to the recovery, which also would, I think, have created some very considerable costs and risks.\par \par \uc2 So I think, you know, the research will continue. And, you know, as I stated earlier, it is precisely because we better understand our conventional tool kit, we have a lot more experience with it, we have much more precision around the impacts.\par \par \uc2 That leads me to be somewhat asymmetric when it comes to risk management in recognizing that we have more space using conventional monetary policy to respond to surprises associated with stronger-than-expected demand than we do with weaker-than-expected demand. And so that leads me to want to be very prudent.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Let me ask you one last question and then we'll open it up to questions from the audience.\par \par \uc2 You talked in your speech, you mentioned the importance of growth in foreign countries, or lack thereof, in terms of its impact on the U.S. economy, and you pointed to Europe and Japan, the slowdown in China and so on.\par \par \uc2 What about looking at it the other way? Do you think that the Fed should consider the impact of its decisions on other countries?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So we operate under very clear statutory guidelines given to us by Congress. Our dual mandate is to focus on U.S. maximum employment and U.S. price stability, which has been defined by the committee as 2% inflation.\par \par \uc2 So our focus has to be here on employment and inflation in the United States, but it is true that the United States operates in a global environment with currency that is, you know, valued as a safe haven, kind of an assets. We're in highly globalized financial markets.\par \par \uc2 And we have seen over the last few years that weakness abroad, adverse developments abroad really matter to the outlook here in the United States. The responsiveness of our exchange rate seems to be several times greater than it has been previously, and the impact on the U.S. flows through financial conditions, flows through on economic activity, not just net exports, although net exports have been hurt by the stronger dollar and we're starting to see that turn around a bit, but also on business investment and, of course, also on core inflation.\par \par \uc2 So when we are formulating policy to achieve the congressionally mandated goals of U.S. maximum employment, U.S. 2% inflation, we have to take into account weakness and risks from abroad.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: OK. So we'll now open it up to questions from the floor. We have some people with microphones. And I would just ask you, please stand up and ask your question and identify yourself.\par \par \uc2 So we have a question right here.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you. Lyric Hughes Hale with EconVue.\par \par \uc2 My question, first of all, on the persistence of prime-age labor, the weakness there, there's a new report out by \uc2 Chicago Booth\uc2  that explains that it seems to be more sociological, that prime-age men are staying at home, and there's no amount of economic incentives that will make them change. So it's just a very interesting background.\par \par \uc2 Also, I read yesterday a report by the \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  on price inflation in the United States. And it said that really the United States is bifurcated in inflation. The things that we absolutely need to have, like health care and education, that those prices have been steadily going up since 1996, but we're insulated from the effect of those price rises because of student loans, because of public and private insurance for health care, and that the things we don't really need, like electronics, because of the strong dollar and because of China, are very cheap and that that's skewing the picture.\par \par \uc2 And it was something that I thought was intriguing. And I wonder if you've seen it and what you thought. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: No, both reports sound very interesting. I have not seen either, but they both sound interesting, and I will make sure to take a look. Yeah, thank you.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: OK. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Yes, right in the middle there's a\u8212\'20\'14we're getting you a microphone.\par \par \uc2 Q: Hi. I'm Rob Laragh from JHL Capital Group.\par \par \uc2 You mentioned in your speech a kind of correspondence between an approximate move in the dollar and an approximate amount of rate hikes. And I wonder if you could talk about how Fed policy has evolved to manage to kind of general financial conditions instead of just the funds rate.\par \par \uc2 And then also, what you think of, effectively, if you do that, we're much easier now than we were in December, you know, credit spreads are narrower, the dollar is weaker, equity prices are a little higher. What are your thoughts on that?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So certainly, the forecasting models that the \uc2 Federal Reserve Board\uc2  uses, both the international model and the U.S. model, do take into account financial conditions and how they impact activity as well as directly the effect of the exchange rate on the core imports part of inflation.\par \par \uc2 So it's possible to simulate an equivalence between how much exchange rate movement would be equivalent to the same amount in the models tightening in the federal funds rate in terms of their impact on activity and in terms of their impact on inflation. And that's where you get the 200 basis point estimate from.\par \par \uc2 But of course, we also, members of the (Federal Open Market Committee) make also judgmental kinds of sort of connections between what we see as the international environment and its impact on underlying growth momentum here as well as inflation as we try to think about how the broader global environment is going to impact the path of monetary policy and how that, in turn, will help with the attainment of our full employment and inflation goals.\par \par \uc2 So it's both kind of a forecasting set of tools that we have that can directly incorporate those, but it also affects different members differentially.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Yes, right there.\par \par \uc2 Q: Jordan Rosenfeld, Gelber Group.\par \par \uc2 If it looks like a majority of other FOMC members are open to a rate hike in coming months, would you dissent? (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: (Laughs.) So the best I can do is to tell you a little bit about, you know, sort of my broader outlook. And I tried to go through that in some detail\u8212\'20\'14you know, how I'm thinking about the current underlying features of the U.S. economy and why they may be different than they were pre-crisis, and very specifically what are the sources of those differences, and then how would that condition my policy views. And you know, again, because the\u8212\'20\'14we've seen this persistent undershooting on inflation; the Phillips curve seems to be flatter inflation expectations seem to be well anchored on the upside but a little soft on the downside; because the labor market does potentially have still-untapped slack; because of the international environment that does have some risks and clearly disinflationary pressures, weak demand; and because of the low neutral rate, all of those things lead me to be somewhat asymmetric in my policy approach.\par \par \uc2 That said, policy, you know, is data-dependent. And my assessment, as well as those of other members, will continue to be based on the evolution of the data. And that's why, you know, I look forward to continuing to assess the data in the months ahead.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: OK, we have a question all the way in the back. Someone had their hand up. Yes?\par \par \uc2 Q: Hi. Jason Lange with Reuters.\par \par \uc2 This morning Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  said that the Fed was keeping interest rates low bowing to political pressure. I wonder if you could comment on that allegation. I know it's not an area that the Fed likes to broach much, but Trump mentioned it in the morning.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So I'm not going to comment specifically on that.\par \par \uc2 But let me just step back a bit and just say that, you know, Congress institutionally created by design an institution in the \uc2 Federal Reserve Board\uc2  that, by design, is supposed to formulate monetary policy in a way that is very focused on two clearly specified objectives that are given to us in the statute: maximum employment and price stability. And so the institution is designed to ensure that independence from the executive branch. And the clarity of our objectives, which are given to us by statute, is absolutely the focus of the deliberations of the FOMC and the focus of our work in monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: We were talking about\u8212\'20\'14you've worked in the executive branch, so we were talking about at lunch the difference between working in the executive branch and working at the Fed. You might want to just mention your impressions. (Chuckles.)\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Absolutely. They are institutionally very different. And the \uc2 Federal Reserve Board\uc2  in its culture, in its values, by design, and in its institution is independent in its making of monetary policy, and again, under very clear objectives given in statute by Congress.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: OK. I had a question right up here in the front.\par \par \uc2 Q: Hi. My name's Doug Gray, a board member and Marshall Street Capital.\par \par \uc2 The question is the balance between fiscal policy and monetary policy. If there were a more aggressive fiscal policy in this country, what would the Federal Board's perspective be? I mean, I know you look at the data, but how do you strike a balance between\u8212\'20\'14and frankly, even motivate\u8212\'20\'14the rest of the executive branch and others to think about fiscal policy? It seems to me you're trying to sort of compensate for some weakness in some other places.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So, you know, I think there, too, while we're careful not to, you know, get into the specifics on the content of a fiscal program or\u8212\'20\'14it is clear\u8212\'20\'14and there was a lot of discussion about this at the recent conference among central bankers; it was international in nature\u8212\'20\'14that at this juncture, where aggregate demand seems to be weak globally and, you know, this has been a slow recovery here in the U.S. but, you know, even slower abroad, with bigger challenges abroad, that this is a moment where fiscal policy could really play a role in supporting both aggregate demand, but also in helping to really strengthen the productive potential here, and of course abroad there's potential for fiscal policy to do more as well.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Any other questions? Yes, in the back.\par \par \uc2 Q: Yes, hi. Shayndi Raice with The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 I just wanted to know, what would you need to see to be supportive of the removal of accommodation?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So, again, I think if you look at the recent developments, it's a mixed picture.\par \par \uc2 There's some welcome progress continuing on the labor market. That's come mainly from bringing people back into the labor force. The unemployment rate has largely moved sideways over the last year, where we have had continued improvements on labor-force participation, particularly among prime-age workers, as well as job growth of payrolls of 180,000, on average, per month. So that's been a positive. Personal consumption expenditure has been very strong, and at least with the latest data point moving into the third quarter we see continued strength there. And that augurs well, I think, for the third quarter. Consumer sentiment remains strong. And of course, financial conditions have eased since earlier in the year.\par \par \uc2 Against that, we have three quarters of just about 1% (annual rate of) growth, a big step down from the same period of last year. We've had very weak net exports, very weak business investment, weak corporate profitability and manufacturing.\par \par \uc2 And so, going forward, it would\u8212\'20\'14it would be important, I think, to see some of those spending indicators starting to really move in a more positive direction going into the third and fourth quarter.\par \par \uc2 And of course, the second leg of our dual mandate, inflation, has now been below (the Fed's 2%) target for 51 months. We've seen some slippage to the downside in inflation expectations. And so the recent movement in inflation, it's now been\u8212\'20\'14it's now at about 1.6% over the previous 12 months. That is an improvement since last year; still noticeably below 2%. And I'm going to be watching carefully, looking for signs of further progress there as well.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Yes, right here?\par \par \uc2 Q: My name's Carol McGillivray, and I actually had two questions.\par \par \uc2 I'm just curious, as someone who's obviously clearly\u8212\'20\'14I appreciate your layout of the what you see as the new normal and why. But how long does it take almost, statistically, before you know the new normal is the normal, for one question? (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 And my other question is about the employment changes or the male population not participating. How much is that structural, with what people are talking about, about with the new-age jobs versus old manufacturing jobs? I mean, is that a big factor in what's happening here?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so I think on the latter question the size of the population that's engaged in the, you know, sort of online gig type of jobs I think is tiny, less than one percentage point, although the increase there has been\u8212\'20\'14has been rapid. But it's still extremely small according to research by some notable labor economists.\par \par \uc2 On the first point, the four features and the fifth kind of policy conclusion that I draw, those are all things that seem to me to be proving somewhat persistent and seem like notable departures from pre-crisis. It's very difficult to say with precision how persistent they are likely to be.\par \par \uc2 Some of them are, you know, likely to be with us for a longer time than other. And, of course, these are things that are measured with some imprecision as well. And, of course, the natural rate of unemployment has a lot of imprecision around it. The neutral rate is something that is estimated also, you know, with a lot of imprecision around it.\par \par \uc2 So, you know, I think as monetary policy makers we do the best we can to construct a coherent framework for understanding the evolution of the data and what it tells us about the likely attainment of our goals. But we also have to be quite humble about the amount of, you know, imprecision. A lot of, you know, these are estimates that have probability distributions around them in many cases or very large confidence intervals.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Yes, right here in the front.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you. Governor Brainard, you spoke about how you think you have the tools, should there be inflation, should there be the need to address. Do you think there's been any evolution in the responsiveness of the economy to monetary measures, in particular the lags? How long you think it takes from\u8212\'20\'14let's say you were to see a burst of wage inflation and the Fed were then to act at its next meeting. How long would it take for that action to kick in?\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So it's a really good question. I don't have a great answer for you on that, although it's something that obviously matters a great deal.\par \par \uc2 My sense is that the responsiveness through financial conditions is relatively rapid now. And we've really seen that again over the last since, you know, June of 2014 as expectations of divergence between the U.S. and foreign economies started to rise. We saw a very immediate response through the exchange rate. And so there does seem to be, at least through the financial transmission channel, a pretty rapid responsiveness.\par \par \uc2 You know, my sense is, again, I won't go back through the reasons that I gave earlier, but for a variety of reasons that if we were to see an unexpected strength and demand, given the state of the global economy, that we would be able to respond to that very effectively with a relatively moderate policy response relative to what might have been necessary pre-crisis.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Yes, in the back.\par \par \uc2 Q: Hello, Governor Brainard. I'm Karen Nye with D.S. Economics.\par \par \uc2 And I'm curious with respect to fiscal policy, if in the various scenarios that you on the FOMC and the staff make up in terms of what might happen with the economy, are you considering the 2016 elections, how it turns out? And I don't mean just the presidency, but the mix between the House and the Senate in terms of what fiscal policies might pass given different permutations after the election.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So there's lots of different sources of macroeconomic uncertainty. And, you know, we try to make the best kind of assessment of the economy as we can, recognizing that there are many sources of macro uncertainty out there.\par \par \uc2 But we don't, at least I don't, and I don't think generally there is any granular consideration given to anything in that arena. I think we try to be very focused on the macroeconomic objectives that we have. We look at the data as it's coming in against those objectives and how they pan out relative to our economic outlook.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: OK, this will have to be the last question, one right here.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you. Michael Wood, Australian consul-general.\par \par \uc2 You've indicated you're more concerned about the capacity of the Fed to respond to negative surprises on the downside. And I wondered if you could share with us your views on the options available to the Fed in the event of a surprise on the downside.\par \par \uc2 I'm thinking personally of a resumption of quantitative easing or negative interest rates.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: So as you probably may have gathered from my remarks, for me the real focus has to be on aligning our policies with achieving our objectives. And that really is the focus at the moment and, in particularly, making sure that we achieve the 2% inflation target, which is symmetric, which is not a ceiling, and maximum employment. And so this is really the focus.\par \par \uc2 As I said earlier, I think that the policy space using conventional tools is much greater on the upside than it is on the downside, is likely to be that for some time, and that other tools which have proven their efficacy here and abroad nonetheless are less well-understood, have greater uncertainties around them.\par \par \uc2 And so, again, my great, you know, sort of emphasis would be on trying to preserve and protect the progress that we've made here at home.\par \par \uc2 MR. MOSKOW: Well, Governor Brainard, on behalf of everyone here and on behalf of the council we want to just thank you for joining us today. This has been an excellent presentation and discussion.\par \par \uc2 MS. BRAINARD: Thank you. Thank you very much.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Menlo Ventures\uc2  Managing Director \uc2 Shawn Carolan\uc2 , who stepped away from the Silicon Valley venture firm to run Handle Inc., an email startup he founded, has returned to invest full-time.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Carolan is also building a team at \uc2 Menlo Ventures\uc2  that will invest in consumer startups, an area that the firm expects to grow as new technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 natural\b0 \highlight\uc2 -\b \highlight22\uc2 language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and computer vision become more widely used.\par \par \uc2 The firm, which is based on Menlo Park's Sand Hill Road, plans to open an office in San Francisco and will hire an additional partner and two associates, according to Mr. Carolan.\par \par \uc2 Before he left for Handle, Mr. Carolan, who joined \uc2 Menlo Ventures\uc2  in 2002 and stayed full-time until 2014, invested in several prominent companies, including Siri, which became the foundation for \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 .'s voice recognition system after Apple acquired the company in 2010.\par \par \uc2 He is a board observer at \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . and a board member at \uc2 Roku Inc\uc2 ., the streaming video service.\par \par \uc2 "We think of Shawn as one of our best thinkers in new emerging consumer areas," which are now capable of creating global companies and winner-takes-all markets, said Menlo Managing Director \uc2 Mark Siegel\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Also, he said, Mr. Carolan has the skills required to find the types of entrepreneurs who launch consumer startups. They tend to be younger and have new ideas, "and the way you find these entrepreneurs and find these ideas is quite different\u8212\'20\'14it is through networks of people," Mr. Siegel said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Carolan said he returned to investing because he's better at looking across companies and finding patterns than he is at running companies. Handle is being restructured under a new CEO.\par \par \uc2 "I believe that technology is the thing uniquely suited to scale across the entire globe, and when you find an important problem and software or combination of hardware or software that can be out to a billion people, it means a lot to me to solve that," Mr. Carolan said.\par \par \uc2 Menlo Ventures\uc2  raised two new funds recently\u8212\'20\'14a $400 million early stage fund in 2015 and a $250 million special opportunities fund in April for "early-growth" investments\u8212\'20\'14and currently makes about half of its investments in consumer companies, with the other half going to startups that sell software to businesses.\par \par \uc2 Although the firm won't increase the amount of money it invests in consumer companies, "there will certainly be an increased concentration," Mr. Siegel said.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160908ec980050v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s president, once mused to colleagues it would take $5 billion before he'd be persuaded to share the firm's prized software that helped make it a trading powerhouse.\par \par \uc2 Now, Goldman is handing it out to clients for free.\par \par \uc2 Called Securities DataBase, or SecDB, the system is Goldman's prime tool for measuring risk and analyzing the prices of securities. It calculates 23 billion prices across 2.8 million positions daily and has played a crucial role in many of the seminal moments of the firm's recent history, including its controversial trading just ahead of the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Goldman had guarded it closely, resisting offers from rivals such as \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2  to license the database. One former partner recalls huddling with Mr. Cohn a decade ago to ponder what a licensing deal would be worth. Mr. Cohn told his colleagues he definitely wouldn't do it for $1 billion. For $5 billion? Maybe, he said, according to the former partner.\par \par \uc2 "It was such a competitive advantage," Mr. Cohn said recently.\par \par \uc2 Today, many of the edges that once made Goldman's traders feared and admired have been blunted. New rules have limited banks' trading risks, and made it costly to hold large inventories of stocks and bonds on their books. And electronic trading has squeezed margins.\par \par \uc2 Traders and executives tap into SecDB for information about how to price securities, and how the value of those assets may change with a twist on the dial on any one of thousands of potential variables. That information can be used to analyze potential trades -- and then to monitor the risks posed by those positions.\par \par \uc2 What made it the envy of Wall Street, though, was its ability to scale up to include new classes of securities, new trading desks, even whole businesses. And the data it harnessed was all in one place. Megamergers left rivals with a hodgepodge of different systems and different factions of employees loyal to each of them. Goldman avoided big acquisitions, evading issues that would slow its ability to track risks.\par \par \uc2 Thus, Goldman's new gambit: Deploy its technology to win more business from clients. Many of those tools are being offered in the form of web-based applications that customers can customize and operate on their own.\par \par \uc2 "It's the content, tools and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  we've been working on for decades, and we're putting it in the hands of clients," said \uc2 R. Martin Chavez\uc2 , Goldman's chief information officer.\par \par \uc2 Some investors and clients harbor doubts that Goldman can pivot so sharply.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not sure their core competency is being a tech company," said Jason Brady, chief executive of Thornburg Investment Management, which manages $55 billion and trades with Goldman. "So it's a shift, and I'm not sure I want that to be their role."\par \par \uc2 The trick for Goldman will be to win over clients like Jeffrey Young, who co-heads an investing unit within \uc2 Ramius LLC\uc2 , a New York money manager. A Goldman saleswoman introduced Mr. Young to a Marquee app during a choppy period in the markets, when he needed regular updates on the bespoke derivatives he had bought from Goldman.\par \par \uc2 "They're trying to be more proactive -- instead of just saying 'we need to satisfy what the client wants,' they're saying 'let's make sure they're as happy as possible,'" he said. "They're more open with a lot of their intellectual property."\par \par \uc2 Goldman is seeking its niche in a crowded field. \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . offers its own risk-management system, called Aladdin, and \uc2 Bloomberg LP\uc2 's terminals remain a ubiquitous presence on trading floors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chavez is an alumnus of J. Aron, the commodities-trading arm where many of Goldman's leaders, including Chairman and Chief Executive \uc2 Lloyd Blankfein\uc2  and his top deputy, Mr. Cohn, got their start.\par \par \uc2 SecDB's run within Goldman began when \uc2 Marc Spilker\uc2 , a currency-options trader, sought a pricing database with the flexibility to add new derivatives. He turned to Armen Avanessians, a former Bell Labs engineer Mr. Blankfein had hired and the man one Goldman alum referred to, somewhat affectionately, as the "Darth Vader" of the strategists, or strats -- a team of engineers J. Aron had begun to assemble to work on computer models.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Avanessians handed the task to Michael Dubno, a college dropout and former videogame developer who had come to Goldman to work for famed economist Fischer Black. Two other engineers, Glenn Gribble and Kevin Lundeen, soon followed. Mr. Avanessians hired Mr. Chavez in 1993 to extend SecDB to J. Aron's commodities desk.\par \par \uc2 The SecDB system received an early test in 1998, when hedge fund \uc2 Long-Term Capital Management\uc2  nearly collapsed. Goldman used the database to help analyze its exposure, an episode that helped raise SecDB's profile within the firm, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Over time, SecDB spread to other parts of J. Aron and, ultimately, the entire firm. As Mr. Blankfein rose up the ranks, he insisted that SecDB and the strategists join him.\par \par \uc2 By the time the housing market boomed, SecDB had reached Goldman's firmwide risk and finance departments. "Thank goodness we did that when we did," recalled Robert Berry, who heads Goldman's market-risk team.\par \par \uc2 As the prices on securities tied to subprime mortgages began to decline in late 2006, Mr. Berry and other executives plotted out how the firm's positions performed against its models. They could soon tell something wasn't right.\par \par \uc2 Goldman made some profitable bets against the housing market and, in some instances, began reducing exposure to other counterparties, even as many of their peers and clients remained bullish. Later, the bank's moves were roundly criticized as evidence it put its own interests above those of its customers. Goldman has defended its actions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chavez left Goldman in the late 1990s, eventually founding a Silicon Valley startup he sold in 2004. While running that company, Mr. Chavez filed an application for a patent on a system some Goldman partners found similar to SecDB. They were incensed that Mr. Chavez had failed to credit Goldman, and brought it to Mr. Cohn's attention, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Goldman sent Mr. Chavez "a nasty letter," one person said. Mr. Cohn, though, declined to authorize a lawsuit. When Mr. Chavez sold his startup, Mr. Cohn persuaded him to rejoin Goldman.\par \par \uc2 Goldman elevated Mr. Chavez to CIO in 2013. The flagship in his strategy is Marquee, a series of applications that allows clients to tap into SecDB and other systems.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160908000109"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160908ec9800066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 TPG is buying a majority stake in \uc2 Intel Security\uc2 , returning the antivirus company once again to a standalone software maker called McAfee\u160\'00\'A0but at a valuation of roughly half what the chipmaker bought it for.\par \par \uc2 The new McAfee will be spun out of \uc2 Intel\uc2  at a valuation of $4.2bn, down 45 per cent from\u160\'00\'A0the $7.7bn \uc2 Intel\uc2  paid in 2010, after six years in which it has received profits from McAfee but failed to deliver on its promise of embedding the group\u8217\'20\'19s cyber security capabilities in \uc2 Intel\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s chips.\par \par \uc2 TPG, the private equity firm, will take a 51 per cent stake and \uc2 Intel\uc2  will retain the remaining 49 per cent. \uc2 Intel\uc2  will receive $3.1bn of cash, $2bn of which will come from new debt taken on by McAfee, and the rest of which will come from TPG\u8217\'20\'19s $1.1bn equity investment.\par \par \uc2 Jim Coulter, co-founder and co-chief executive of TPG, said McAfee could sharpen its focus and respond faster to the \u8220\'20\'1Crapidly-evolving\u8221\'20\'1D cyber security sector as an independent company. TPG had been in discussions with \uc2 Intel\uc2  for 10 months, seeing off competition from other private equity bidders in the early stages.\par \par \uc2 Private equity buyers have been hunting for cyber security companies, attracted by strong revenue prospects from a sector whose clients remain concerned about the potential damage caused by cyber attacks. So far this year, \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2  has bought \uc2 Ping Identity\uc2  for an undisclosed sum, while \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2  sold Bluecoat to \uc2 Symantec\uc2  for almost double what it paid for the company the year before.\par \par \uc2 TPG has invested in cyber security companies ZScaler, which secures the cloud, and Tanium, which helps companies deploy security fixes rapidly.\par \par \uc2 McAfee will be one of the largest standalone security companies in a very fragmented industry, facing competition from a new generation of start-ups backed by a flood of venture capital pouring into the sector. It will be led by Chris Young, who managed \uc2 Intel Security\uc2  when it was part of \uc2 Intel\uc2 , and is likely to use its new independence to acquire cyber security start-ups to bring newer technologies to its established platforms.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to employees and customers, Mr Young said McAfee would emerge from the deal in a position of \u8220\'20\'1Cgreater strength\u8221\'20\'1D, working towards its \u8220\'20\'1Cnoble cause\u8221\'20\'1D of protecting consumers, corporations and governments from cyber criminals. In the first half of this year, revenue at \uc2 Intel Security\uc2  increased 11 per cent to $1.1bn, while operating income rose almost fourfold to $182m.\par \par \uc2 Intel\uc2  in 2010 hoped to integrate McAfee\u8217\'20\'19s security products on to its chips, promising the ability to detect threats at a deeper level. But the company has failed to complete this plan after six years and many of the senior leadership from before the deal have departed.\par \par \uc2 Intel\uc2  is now trying to position itself as a leading chipmaker for the \u8220\'20\'1Cinternet of things\u8221\'20\'1D era, acquiring computer vision and \b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  start-ups. \uc2 Brian Krzanich\uc2 , its chief executive, said the chipmaker would continue to work closely with the new standalone McAfee and prioritise security.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  first reported that \uc2 Intel\uc2  was weighing up the sale of its cyber security business in June.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160907ec9700b19\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14International regulators have pushed back their year-end deadline to finalize controversial new bank capital rules, amid intense resistance from European policy makers.\par \par \uc2 The little-noticed shift in the timetable came {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/FSB-Chair���s-letter-to-G20-Leaders-in-advance-of-their-meeting-in-Hangzhou-on-4-5-September..pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in a late-August statement  }}}\uc2 issued by \uc2 Mark Carney\uc2  , who chairs the \uc2 Financial Stability Board\uc2  , a committee created in the wake of the financial crisis to bolster the global financial safety net. Mr. Carney said that long-awaited rules affecting the balance sheets of the world's largest banks would be completed "by early 2017." That was in contrast to statements from other officials throughout the year pledging action by the end of 2016.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Carney, who is also governor of the Bank of England, was referring to new guidelines being crafted by a separate global body, the \uc2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\uc2  , which has spent the year attempting to address weaknesses spotlighted by the financial crisis. Officials are considering new rules that would limit how banks calculate their own risks and require them to hew more closely to formulas created by regulators.\par \par \uc2 Basel officials have said the proposals are aimed at creating more consistency among banks, and aren't designed to force them to hold more expensive capital on their books.\par \par \uc2 But European officials have objected to the effort, raising concerns that the changes could significantly increase bank capital requirements, depressing bank profitability and undermining the continent's already sluggish economy.\par \par \uc2 That is a stark contrast with the U.S., where regulators led by the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  are openly pushing for still-higher capital on the books of the big banks.\par \par \uc2 In his Aug. 30 letter, Mr. Carney reiterated a commitment that upcoming changes to the so-called Basel III framework would "not significantly" increase overall capital requirements across the banking industry. Mr. Carney's statement was addressed to the leaders of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  advanced and developing economies ahead of their two-day summit in China.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.g20.org/English/Dynamic/201609/t20160906_3396.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 In their communiqu\u233\'00\'E9 issued Tuesday }}}\uc2 , the G-20 leaders said they were still pushing for completion of the Basel rules this year, dubbed the "Basel III" round, following two earlier iterations of such guidelines.\par \par \uc2 "We reiterate our support for the work by the \uc2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\uc2  to finalize the Basel III framework by the end of 2016, without further significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the banking sector, while promoting a level playing field," the statement said.\par \par \uc2 Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner of the policy analysis firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2  . said the Carney and G-20 statements appeared to be setting somewhat different targets to allow the parties to try to reconcile their differences.\par \par \uc2 Given the continuing opposition from some countries, she said, there is a new push by global regulators "to reach a tentative agreement by year-end, but not finalize a deal until there is another survey" to rebut the critics and "prove" that revised changes won't significantly increase capital requirements.\par \par \uc2 Write to Donna Borak at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:donna.borak@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 donna.borak@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160907ec9700bvt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

According to a January filing with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , the fund raised at least $310.9 million, about $97.5 million of which came from a parallel fund.\par \par \uc2 Amid its fundraising efforts, the New York firm has been active in deploying its capital in technology and technology-enabled financial services companies, having made two other purchases: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0120141104eab4vtj09"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 CRGT Inc.}}}\uc2 , which develops software for government agencies; and \uc2 Solace Systems\uc2 , a data-distribution hardware and software company.\par \par \uc2 For the Finalsite deal, which is likely to be announced as soon as Thursday, Bridge Growth and its co-investors\u8212\'20\'14mostly investors of the firm\u8212\'20\'14have invested more than $100 million of equity into the software company, the person said. That brings the total amount of equity the firm and its co-investors have put to work across Bridge Growth's first three investments to more than $300 million, they said.\par \par \uc2 Finalsite provides website design, search assistance, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and training to schools, colleges and other education companies in the U.S. and internationally. The Glastonbury, Conn., company serves more than 1,500 schools and 1,180-plus clients globally, including independent U.S. and international schools, U.S. public school districts and higher education institutions and other nonprofit organizations.\par \par \uc2 With the investment, Bridge Growth aims to tap the rising demand from the education sector to leverage web-based platforms to communicate with students and their families on matters such as enrollment, grading, and social networking with current students and alumni, as well as the increasing number of international schools overseas. International schools, catering to children of expatriates, often rely on their websites for both recruiting students and teaching staff.\par \par \uc2 Bridge Growth will support Finalsite's investment in product development and sales, and will aid potential acquisitions both in the U.S. and in overseas markets, the person said.\par \par \uc2 Finalsite founder Jon Moser will continue to lead the company as chief executive and serve on its board of directors, the person said.\par \par \uc2 Evercore advised Bridge Growth on the deal.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LONDON -- In the tumultuous weeks following Britain's vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . restarted talks on a deal to buy an office-building development. So Wells sought to do what several other big property purchasers have done since the historic Brexit vote: negotiate a "retrade."\par \par \uc2 On July 18, Wells said it would spend nearly GBP 300 million ($399.1 million) to buy the property, slightly below what was in the works before the vote, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  will be using the building to house its London operations, which consist primarily of 850 employees who serve the bank's corporate, commercial and financial institution customers as they do business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\par \par \uc2 "We're making a long-term commitment here," said Frank Pizzo, regional president for Europe, Mideast and Africa region at Wells Fargo. Brexit didn't have "any impact on that position."\par \par \uc2 The deal happened at a time when the U.K. real-estate market was in chaos, with landlords' stocks tumbling and redemptions halted on some property funds. London office values have suffered the most thus far, according to experts, but some analysts have predicted a broad swath of U.K. commercial real-estate prices could fall further over the next 12 months.\par \par \uc2 Retrades have made up a large portion of the transactions that have taken place since the June 23 vote, according to market participants.\par \par \uc2 But the discounts, as reflected by the \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  deal, have been less than those suffered by sellers in the U.K. and other real-estate markets in previous shocks, most recently the 2008 global financial collapse. Back then markets essentially ground to a halt, said \uc2 Anne Breen\uc2 , head of real-estate research and strategy at asset manager Standard Life Investments, one of the fund managers that has halted redemptions.\par \par \uc2 "Today in the U.K., the backdrop is quite different. There remains liquidity," Ms. Breen said. "The banks are still open for business. Investors are still looking at property yield and think it's attractive. The REITs [real-estate investment trusts] are very well financed and structured relative to previous cycles."\par \par \uc2 Part of the reason the market has remained relatively buoyant: currency fluctuations.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , for example, benefited from the steep drop in the sterling compared with dollars following the referendum, which essentially knocked another 12% off the sticker price.\par \par \uc2 Still, in the weeks following the vote, market messages have been mixed. The good news has been that shares of many listed property companies have rebounded, with the notable exception being owners of London office and residential property.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, managers of about half the open ended funds that focused on U.K. property have continued to freeze redemptions. Some of those that have kept their redemption window open have imposed extra costs on investors who have wanted out.\par \par \uc2 Such bargains are prompting some investors to sniff for buying opportunities. Norwegian sovereign-wealth fund manager Norges Bank Investment Management purchased a high profile Oxford Street commercial building in mid-July for GBP 124 million from \uc2 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC\uc2 , one of the asset managers that has continued making redemptions.\par \par \uc2 Values of some commercial property in London had moved into record territory in recent years after recovering from the losses they suffered following the 2008 market crash.\par \par \uc2 But even before the Brexit vote, signs were mounting that values were beginning to decline. The value of U.K. commercial real estate declined 0.3% in June, according to an index compiled by \uc2 MSCI Inc\uc2 ., a research firm.\par \par \uc2 The surprise vote raised questions about when, and how, the U.K. will break off its richly entwined relationship with the \uc2 EU\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The terms of the exit will have an impact on the U.K. economy and influence how U.K.-based businesses are allowed to operate within the \uc2 EU\uc2 , both major factors for property investors. The MSCI index fell 2.8% in July, the biggest decline since March 2009.\par \par \uc2 Deal activity also slowed. About $5 billion of property transactions have been completed since the vote, less than half of the $12.9 billion of deals during the same period last year and the GBP 13.4 billion in 2014, according to property data-firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other buyers also are retrading deals. German property investor Deka Immobilien GmbH bought a 14-story office building in Manchester in August for GBP 164 million, less than the price that had been settled on before the referendum, according to a statement from the firm.\par \par \uc2 But so far, highly distressed discounts have been outliers. And because property values haven't immediately collapsed, potential sellers might offer up to 5% off pre-Brexit values, but are typically unwilling to negotiate any lower, said Bruce Dear, head of London real estate at U.K. law firm Eversheds.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160907000022"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160907ec970000z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

But the rebound was not strong enough to avert a fall in total revenues from investment banking for the top 12 banks, according to figures from Coalition, a London-based group that combines public information with independent research and validation by a network of market participants.\par \par \uc2 The banks' revenues from trading stocks and bonds, and advising companies on mergers and capital raising, came to $79bn in the first half, down from $93.3bn in 2015. That marked the steepest year-on-year fall since a 25 per cent drop between the first halves of 2009 and 2010. The peak was $140bn in the first half of 2009.\par \par \uc2 George Kuznetsov, head of research and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at Coalition, said the prospects for a better second half of 2016 looked good, as the third quarter had continued in a similar vein as the second. Even so, he said, no bank expected its own revenues to rise more than 5 per cent or 6 per cent next year, as tougher rules on capital and risk-taking continued to weigh heavily on the industry.\par \par \uc2 "Investment banks are realising there is no top-line relief, capital allocation from [parent companies] probably won't change much, and regulations won't change much. So improvement in returns becomes dependent on optimising the cost base or grabbing market share," Mr Kuznetsov said.\par \par \uc2 Banks have tried to keep a lid on expenses by relocating support staff to cheaper locations and by tying pay - their biggest cost - more closely to income. At \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , for example, compensation and benefits dropped 13 per cent in the second quarter from the previous year, exactly in line with net revenues.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160906ec960001w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

"The main litigation issues are solved at least for most of the banks and therefore there's an assumption in the market that further down the road we don't see any huge litigation," said Ingo Speich, portfolio manager at Frankfurt-based Union Investment. "The risk is that at some point something could pop up that affects the entire banking sector that nobody has on their radar screen."\par \par \uc2 The 10 banks - the five biggest Wall Street operations plus \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 , \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , \uc2 UBS\uc2 , \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and \uc2 Barclays\uc2  - are also eyeing the future cautiously. They began 2016 with $43.7bn of collective provisions to pay future fines and litigation, up from the $36.3bn they had at the start of 2015. Outstanding issues include US mortgage mis-selling fines for European banks and Russian trading issues for Deutsche .\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  topped the penalty list for 2016 so far, paying out more than $5bn over mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.

This was not between "left-" and "right-" wing economists; instead, the crucial faultline was whether the mandarins did or did not care about finance.\par \par \uc2 Back then, while many participants happily debated in the highlands of macroeconomic discourse, some central bank officials - such as William White, chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements, or his colleague \uc2 Claudio Borio\uc2  - were deeply worried about what was happening down in the the weeds of global finance. In particular they feared excesses were building with newfangled instruments that many traded but few truly understood, such as credit default swaps. However, those Cassandras were a minority; most central bankers were so obsessed with seemingly benign "real" economy issues such as inflation, unemployment or growth rates.\par \par \uc2 A decade later this intellectual split has closed - a little bit. For after the financial crisis exploded in 2007, it become painfully clear to policymakers that finance sometimes can hurt the "real" economy. What was happening in those seemingly arcane derivatives markets in 2006, for example, was fuelling a mortgage and corporate borrowing binge - and when that imploded it tipped the wider economy into recession. So after 2008, central bankers implemented reforms that are supposed to force them to try to understand how the finer details of financial markets might end up damaging the global economy again.\par \par \uc2 In the US, the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  has created a \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2  , which is supposed to take a joined-up view of finance. An Office for Financial Research has been established to use \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques to track how money moves around the world with far greater accuracy than before. Meanwhile in the UK, the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  has established a Financial Policy Committee to track the financial system; this complements its interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, which tends to watch what is happening in the real economy. And in the academic sphere, the study of finance is no longer relegated to business schools; it is creeping into high-status university economics departments too.\par \par \uc2 But this revolution was never wholesale - and may now be going into retreat. Consider, for example, Jackson Hole. This year's gathering featured some debate about "real economy" issues. There was also extensive discussion about whether central banks need new tools to boost growth and fight deflation.\par \par \uc2 But what was notably absent from the agenda was a full-blown discussion about the issue that is on the minds of most financial practitioners: namely some of the peculiar distortions that are developing in the weeds of modern finance. Anybody who deals with financial markets on a micro level today - as a banker, asset manager or corporate treasurer - knows that many asset prices are extraordinarily elevated.\par \par \uc2 Never mind the most obvious headline-grabbing points, such as the record-high levels of US equities or the fact that more than $13tn worth of global government and corporate bonds carry negative rates. What is equally striking are the numerous tiny signals that tend to go ignored: the fact that in Denmark mortgages now carry negative interest rates; or that in Japan, the central bank has gobbled up so many equities that it owns about 15 per cent of the free float of companies such as \uc2 Fast Retailing\uc2 , and is committed to buying \u165\'00\'A56tn worth more exchange traded funds this year.\par \par \uc2 These peculiarities are creating headaches for pension funds, insurance companies and banks, to name but a few. But the Jackson Hole tribe barely mentioned these at all. The only voice in the central bank community that has been shouting loudly about these numbers is the BIS; its latest annual report issues a chilling indictment about the unsustainable nature of these peculiarly low rates and the dangers of "debt-fuelled growth". But, this has largely been ignored - as in 2006.\par \par \uc2 This is ominous. In the short term, those sky-high asset prices seem unlikely to produce a full-blown 2008-style crisis; there is less leverage in the western financial system today than in 2006 and banking is more robust because of post-crisis reforms. Moreover, it seems that those rock-bottom low rates reflect long-term structural issues - such as ageing demographics and falling productivity - as much as central bank interventions. This suggests they could endure for a long time.\par \par \uc2 But just because policymakers have become inured to a deeply peculiar financial world, that does not mean that it is "normal" or healthy; or not any more than it was in 2006. We had all better hope that by the summer of 2017 a debate about finance gets a proper billing at Jackson Hole. And that the BIS keeps shouting loudly about this distorted system - and is finally heard.\par \par \uc2 gillian.tett@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160902ec920001c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

But Swift, formally called the \uc2 Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication\uc2 , says it has limited power to make users comply with system guidelines on its own.\par \par \uc2 The company can shut banks out of its network, but has rarely done so. Chief Executive \uc2 Gottfried Leibbrandt{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/swift-ceo-surprised-by-extent-of-cyberattacks-1464909418"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 told The Wall Street Journal in a June interview}}}\uc2  that this could lead to firms using newer, untested channels.\par \par \uc2 Swift rolled out a plan for beefing up security earlier this year, in the wake of cyberattacks on customers in Bangladesh, Vietnam and Ecuador. But it didn't include details of how the new standards would be enforced. "We can come out with guidelines for air gaps, then an interesting question is, \u8216\'20\'18Who will enforce this, and Swift, why don't you enforce it?' " said Mr. Leibbrandt. "As far as I am concerned, nothing is off the table on this."\par \par \uc2 Swift has been working on detecting patterns of user behavior to spot anomalies, and a framework for audits to be conducted by independent third parties. The network connects more than 11,000 institutions across more than 200 countries and territories. But some users have been reluctant to inform Swift of cyber incidents, leaving the company continually urging them to report problems. Meanwhile, others have been slow to adopt new security measures.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Swift took a fresh tack, telling customers it would alert regulators and trading partners if banks didn't take the specific step of installing new software updates by a Nov. 19 deadline.\par \par \uc2 In a letter sent to customers Tuesday viewed by The Wall Street Journal, Swift said it reserves "the right to share information on non-compliant customers with regulators, authorities and/or their counterparties."\par \par \uc2 Also in the letter, Swift disclosed new attacks at customer sites, warning the new software protections were needed because cyberattacks using stolen Swift credentials were continuing. Swift said "a good number" of the fresh attacks had been thwarted, however.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Swift declined to comment on the nature, number and location of the firms newly targeted. In the letter, the company said it had no indication its core messaging services had been compromised.\par \par \uc2 The communication shows Swift is under pressure to tighten up security. One of its former chief executives {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/swift-banking-network-struggles-with-wave-of-cyberattacks-1463786328"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 previously told the Journal}}}\uc2  the company hadn't been aggressive enough on security at user sites.\par \par \uc2 Swift said it last introduced new software in July. The latest update includes a two-stage process to authenticate payment instructions; these commonly include a password plus a separately generated code. Many large banks have two-factor authentication systems of their own, but Swift software now comes with a version built in.\par \par \uc2 In the letter, Swift also reminded customers that they are required to report problems to the network operator, and that their first line of cyberdefense should be turning off certain message types or recipients in their Swift systems.\par \par \uc2 In July, Swift {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/swift-hires-cybersecurity-firms-following-customer-breaches-1468240947"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 hired forensic specialists}}}\uc2  at \uc2 BAE Systems PLC\uc2 , a London-based defense firm whose researchers have been blogging about cyber incidents at Swift user sites, and Fox-IT, based in the Netherlands, to help in its response to the attacks.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  Gets Stand-Alone Asset-Management License in China\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-gets-stand-alone-asset-management-license-in-china-1472718818"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Chinese financial regulators have granted}}}\uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . permission to operate a wholly owned asset-management firm, according to a government filing, the latest evidence that Beijing is becoming more comfortable with foreign firms accessing its financial markets.\par \par \uc2 The JP Morgan Asset Management (Shanghai) Co. was granted a license by the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Administration, according to a regulatory notice dated Aug. 24 on the agency's website. The rare license to operate a stand-alone money-management firm in China was issued shortly before the country welcomes leaders from the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  to a summit on economic matters and follows lobbying by U.S. authorities for China to improve access for foreign investors.\par \par \uc2 Bank Stocks' Surge Makes 2016 Rate Rise Look More Likely\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-stocks-surge-makes-2016-rate-rise-look-more-likely-1472722201"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 An August surge in U.S. bank shares}}}\uc2  is fueling an emerging consensus that the economy is strong enough to allow \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  officials to raise interest rates at least once by the end of 2016.\par \par \uc2 The S&P Financial Sector rose 3.6% in August, far outperforming a 0.1% decline in the S&P 500 and making financials the best-performing sector in the index for the first month this year. A Fed interest-rate rise would deliver banks modest but long-awaited relief from profit-sapping low interest rates, which have been at the center of the industry's long postcrisis slump.\par \par \uc2 Six Weeks Later, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , Amazon End Partnership\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-amazon-end-student-loan-partnership-1472681989"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 That was quick. A partnership between Amazon.com}}}\uc2  and \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 .'s private student lending department has come to an end about six weeks after it was announced.\par \par \uc2 Spokeswomen for both companies confirmed that the partnership, which was more than a year in the making, has come to an end. The reasons for the breakup weren't immediately known and the companies didn't elaborate. The partnership was a big deal for both companies. It was supposed to give \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  a leg up in an increasingly competitive private student loan market that has seen an influx of fintech lenders and other firms enter in recent years.\par \par \uc2 RBC Capital Agrees to $2.5 Million \uc2 SEC\uc2  Settlement\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/rbc-capital-agrees-to-2-5-million-sec-settlement-1472671160"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 RBC Capital Markets LLC}}}\uc2  agreed to pay more than $2.5 million to settle accusations that it provided a client with false and misleading information about its valuation analysis, which was then included in a proxy statement, the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2 's claims stem from private-ambulance company \uc2 Rural/Metro Corp\uc2 .'s sale in 2011 to a private-equity firm. RBC Capital, which was the lead financial adviser to Rural/Metro, received a $500,000 fee for an opinion to be presented to \uc2 Rural/Metro\uc2 's board as it considered the sale.\par \par \uc2 Visa's Chief Accountant on Receiving\u8212\'20\'14and Sending\u8212\'20\'14Comment Letters\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2016/08/31/visa-inc-s-chief-accountant-on-receiving-and-sending-comment-letters/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 James Hoffmeister regularly wrote letters}}}\uc2  questioning financial reporting decisions while working for the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . But as chief accounting officer at Visa Inc., he says receiving a comment letter from the regulator triggered the typical human response to criticism: self-doubt.\par \par \uc2 Visa\uc2  was one of 166 companies the \uc2 SEC\uc2  queried on the use of custom accounting metrics, according to letters made public in the year through Aug. 5 according to Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .

Some borrowers have been told they were no longer eligible for certain kinds of loans or would have to pay higher interest rates, according to the customers.\par \par \uc2 "This is kind of novel," said Jeffrey Naimon, a consumer-finance attorney and partner at law firm BuckleySandler LLP. "I don't think the market has gotten its arms around it."\par \par \uc2 The issue for lenders is how to classify loans in the \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  age. Historically, that has been easy: A house usually was either a principal residence or an investment property. Mortgages on the latter are often viewed as riskier because owners had less of a personal connection to the house and rental income isn't always reliable.\par \par \uc2 Now, the distinction isn't so clear-cut. Online-rental services are spreading rapidly; \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 's website had 455,223 active listings in the U.S. as of July, up 80% from a year earlier, according to research firm YipitData. That is posing challenges to lenders and frustrating some customers, illustrating how fast-paced technological change can reverberate in unexpected ways.\par \par \uc2 The issue comes up when borrowers report income from services such as \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  when applying for a new loan, often in hope of improving their credit profile. That, they hope, can lead to a better interest rate on a loan.\par \par \uc2 Brad Severtson, a resident of Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, earned roughly $30,000 last year from renting out a cottage in his Victorian home's backyard. He thought that would work in his favor when he applied in early 2016 to refinance a home-equity line of credit at \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The bank turned him down, saying it didn't allow home-equity lines of credit on properties in which the homeowner is operating a business, including \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 . Mr. Severtson, a 61-year-old data scientist and former Rhodes scholar, was taken aback.\par \par \uc2 "Here's a bank I've had a relationship with for 30 years," he said. "The assumption to me was the more your income is, the less risk to them. That assumption was wrong."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Severtson ultimately refinanced with \uc2 Umpqua Holdings Corp\uc2 ., a Portland, Ore.-based bank.\par \par \uc2 A Bank of America spokesman said the bank doesn't provide home-equity lines of credit on investment properties.\par \par \uc2 He said the bank would consider a customer's primary residence an investment property if there was a "material amount of commercial activity," but that "incremental renting" wouldn't be an issue.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Airbnb said such incidents "are incredibly rare."\par \par \uc2 Mortgage lenders typically apply tougher underwriting standards, including larger down payments and higher rates, to second homes or investment properties that owners don't live in for most of the year.\par \par \uc2 For mortgages made this past April that went toward the purchase of a home, lenders on average were willing to finance 84% of a property's value if the borrower intended to live there, according to data from real-estate \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 CoreLogic Inc\uc2 . The average interest rate was 3.76%. For investment properties, lenders only financed 72% of the home's value, on average, and charged an average interest rate of 4.29%.\par \par \uc2 That is because borrowers have shown a greater propensity to default on investment-property loans. Cumulative losses on investment-property loans included in private-label mortgage bonds issued in the four years before the financial crisis reached nearly 20% in early 2016, according to data from \uc2 Moody's Investors Service\uc2  and ABSNet Loan. For owner-occupied mortgages, the loss rate was about 14%.\par \par \uc2 An additional worry: Defaults can trigger requests from mortgage investors and government agencies for a lender to repurchase the loan. So, many lenders proceed with caution when a loan doesn't fit neatly into a predefined category, although that is less true for "jumbo" mortgages on high-price homes that often stay on bank balance sheets.\par \par \uc2 For mainstream lenders in the postcrisis mortgage world, "the last thing they want is someone coming back to them later" with a request to repurchase soured loans, said \uc2 Christopher Mayer\uc2 , a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School.\par \par \uc2 That, though, can cause issues for some borrowers. Stephen Labovsky this spring applied to \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  to refinance the mortgage on his home in San Francisco's Glen Park neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Labovsky, 72, and his wife were active \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  hosts and had registered their property with the city government. That permits them to rent space for an unlimited number of nights a year while they reside in the home and for no more than 90 nights when they aren't on the premises.\par \par \uc2 But because the couple were operating short-term rentals for much of the year, Mr. Labovsky said, \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  recommended he apply for a mortgage as if his home were an investment property. That would have increased the interest rate by up to 0.5 percentage point, he said. Mr. Labovsky, a retired filmmaker, stuck with his existing mortgage.\par \par \uc2 Greg Gwizdz\uc2 , national sales manager for Wells Fargo's mortgage division, said the bank has no policy of restricting short-term rentals on its borrowers' properties.\par \par \uc2 He said that services like \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  haven't caused changes in the bank's position on what constitutes a primary residence or an investment property.\par \par \uc2 Still, he acknowledges there may be confusion within the industry. Similar questions were raised a few years ago about whether homeowners' traditional insurance policies would also apply to their \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  activity. The startup eventually responded by offering hosts free, primary liability coverage up to $1 million per incident.\par \par \uc2 In the case of mortgage refinancing, though, banks will likely have to gain more experience with \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  hosts.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the programs that are new that allow people to rent out their properties short term or in different ways that may not have existed 10 years ago may not be fully understood by every lender across America," Mr. Gwizdz said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20160830000012"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020160830ec8v00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The trend is fuelled not only by the rise of ecommerce but also by the dramatic increase of mobile payments to offline merchants such as supermarkets and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 Chinese consumers switching from swiping plastic cards to scanning QR codes with mobile wallet apps knocked $20bn from banks' fee income in 2015, according to Kapronasia, a Shanghai-based fintech consultancy.\par \par \uc2 Settlement fees are only part of banks' overall revenue mix, which is dominated by interest income from loans. The bigger challenge to Chinese lenders, analysts say, comes from the way in which third-party payment providers are interposing themselves between banks and customers, depriving lenders of data on consumption patterns.\par \par \uc2 Zennon Kapron , founder of Kapronasia, said: "Banks are starved of the critical transaction data that would help them to provide competitive products and services."\par \par \uc2 Most users of Alipay, and rival \uc2 WeChat\uc2  Pay owned by Tencent, fund payments by linking their traditional bank accounts to mobile wallet apps. That means traditional bank deposits are still the ultimate source of funds. But when a consumer uses Alipay or \uc2 WeChat\uc2  for payment, banks do not receive data on the merchant's name and location. The loss of data poses a challenge when banks' traditional lending business is under pressure from interest-rate deregulation, rising defaults and the need to curb loan growth following the credit binge . \b \highlight22\uc2 Big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  are seen as vital to lenders' ability to expand into new business lines.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160830ec8u00017\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LogRhythm Inc\uc2 . said it raised an additional $50 million and added three new investors to help expand its business identifying and counteracting cybersecurity threats.\par \par \uc2 Although LogRhythm considered an initial public offering{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020140722ea7mao2cj"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  in 2014}}}\uc2 , when the company last received outside financing, Chief Executive Andy Grolnick said the uncertain and volatile nature of the public markets these days led the company to consider other alternatives.\par \par \uc2 "We looked at the options and decided at the end of last year that we thought the best approach was doing private financing to build value and grow the company as a private company for now," said Mr. Grolnick, adding that LogRhythm would "leave the door open for the public markets down the road."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grolnick said the company began a competitive process for investors in the first quarter. That process eventually culminated in the company securing the $50 million round led by existing investor Riverwood Capital, with participation from Adams Street Partners, \uc2 Siemens Venture Capital\uc2 , Delta-v Capital and members of the company's management team, according to a news release.\par \par \uc2 Joining the existing investors are new backers EDBI, the investment arm of the \uc2 Singapore Economic Development Board\uc2 ; Exclusive Ventures, the investment arm of \uc2 Exclusive Networks\uc2 , a LogRhythm distributor; and Silver Lake Waterman, the late-stage growth strategy of technology investor Silver Lake. The valuation for LogRhythm wasn't disclosed in the release.\par \par \uc2 The $50 million funding round comes on top of $72 million in equity the company has raised so far to date, said a spokeswoman for LogRhythm. The company in July 2014 announced it raised $40 million in funding from Riverwood, Adams Street, \uc2 Access Venture Partners\uc2  and Piper Jaffray Merchant Banking.\par \par \uc2 LogRhythm's security information and event management technology provides behavioral \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , cybercrime detection and endpoint threat detection, among other offerings. The Boulder, Colo., company, which also provides products aimed at the compliance space, serves customers in higher education, banking, energy, health care, retail and the public sector, according to its website.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grolnick said the company likely will use the new funding to expand its global sales and marketing presence and to invest in research and development to enhance its product platform.\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Cooper at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.cooper@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.cooper@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160830ec8u00bni\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

In 2012, there were 15 deals, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, but in each of the next three years there were more than 50 deals.\par \par \uc2 Rev1 Ventures, which evolved from a local angel group, raised a $22 million seed fund, its largest to date, to invest in Columbus-area startups across a broad range of technologies\u8212\'20\'14software, hardware, life sciences, alternative energy and advanced materials.\par \par \uc2 Also, Drive Capital, based in Columbus, closed its second fund at $300 million.\par \par \uc2 Rev1, in addition to investing, guides entrepreneurs on business strategy and connects them to local business services and companies, which include 14 of the Fortune 1000, according to Chief Executive \uc2 Tom Walker\uc2 . Portfolio companies include Updox, which provides customer relationship management software for doctors.\par \par \uc2 Some of the startups are formed around intellectual property from local research institutions, he said, particularly in the area of data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Backers of the fund, called Rev1 Fund I LLC, include Nationwide, \uc2 Ohio State University\uc2  and \uc2 Cardinal Health\uc2  as well as the Ohio Third Frontier Pre-Seed/Seed-Plus Fund Capitalization Program, which provided an $8 million loan to help Rev1 get bigger faster, Mr. Walker said.\par \par \uc2 "One of the big challenges you have in a state like Ohio or a region like the Midwest is that there's traditionally not a lot of venture capital," he said, "\u8230\'20\'26so Third Frontier participates to get the size of the fund up to a level where we can compete with other regions of the U.S."\par \par \uc2 Drive Capital's fund, meanwhile, came in at $300 million which is $50 million larger than its first fund. The firm was co-founded in 2012 by former partners at \uc2 Sequoia Capital\uc2  in Menlo Park, Calif. who decided the Midwest offered better opportunities than Silicon Valley for building companies.\par \par \uc2 Drive Capital is targeting the broader Midwest, including Ann Arbor, Mich.; Pittsburgh and several other cities based on the quality of the region's universities and potential corporate customers and the idea that it is now easier to start a company anywhere, the firm said.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160830ec8u003xq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Mylan NV\uc2 , whose price increases on its lifesaving EpiPen drug drew broad criticism this month, said Monday it would launch a half-priced generic version of the medicine\u8212\'20\'14in effect, competing against itself.\par \par \uc2 Mylan said it would begin selling the generic product within weeks for a price of $300 for two injection pens, compared with a list price of about $609 for its branded EpiPen product. The generic version, which delivers the same drug, is expected to eat into Mylan's revenue from the EpiPen, which had $1 billion in world-wide sales last year and was the company's largest single product by revenue.\par \par \uc2 The company's plan appeared intended to address mounting criticism of its pricing practices and followed a 12% decline in Mylan's share price last week.\par \par \uc2 The EpiPen price increases exploded over social media and on Capitol Hill, in part, because many children depend on the drug-injection device to reverse severe allergic reactions.\par \par \uc2 Most consumers pay less than $100 out-of-pocket for EpiPen, according to Mylan. But a sizable minority are covered by high-deductible health-plans that require buyers to pay a much larger share of the drug's full list price.\par \par \uc2 Mylan had said last week it would increase the value of its EpiPen copay coupons from $100 to $300. The coupons, however, won't apply to purchases of the generic product.\par \par \uc2 With the new generic product, most consumers should be able to cap their costs at $300 per EpiPen prescription. Once it is available, pharmacists can use it to fill any EpiPen prescription unless a doctor requests the branded drug.\par \par \uc2 Some insurers may block patients from receiving the generic because they have negotiated discounts and rebates that make the brand-name drug cheaper than $300, said Adam Fein, a pharmaceutical industry consultant at Pembroke Consulting.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest administrator of prescription-drug insurance, said it was too early to say whether it would encourage patients to use the generic instead of branded EpiPen. Mylan's generic price of $300 "is still too high compared to what it was even a few years ago," the spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 "We understand the deep frustration and concerns associated with the cost of EpiPen to the patient, and have always shared the public's desire to ensure that this important product be accessible to anyone who needs it," Mylan Chief Executive \uc2 Heather Bresch\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Complaints about EpiPen's price reached a fever-pitch this month as parents filled EpiPen prescriptions for the new school year and found the price had risen 32% since last September. EpiPen's list price since 2007 has climbed nearly 550%, from about $94, according to data from \uc2 Truven Health \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Parents voiced their outrage over the higher prices on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and other social media. Lawmakers, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), called for an investigation into Mylan's price increases.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, leaders of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sent a letter to Mylan seeking details about the company's operations and pricing practices for EpiPen.\par \par \uc2 The cost of EpiPen prescriptions has fallen hardest on such customers as Jessica Orosz, a mother of two in Twinsburg, Ohio. Her husband's health-insurance plan has an annual deductible of $5,000 and requires the family to pay all prescription drug costs until they spent $6,000.\par \par \uc2 Health-care costs are "breaking our bank," said Ms. Orosz, whose family earns about $40,000 annually.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Orosz's 22-month-old son, Oakley, suffers from a dozen food allergies that require her to always keep an EpiPen on hand.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the family paid $400 for two EpiPens, using a $100 copay coupon from Mylan.\par \par \uc2 This year, Ms. Orosz discovered the cost of replacing her expired EpiPens at her pharmacy had risen to $735 and began posting her shock at the price increase on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , including the pages of Sen. Klobuchar and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.).\par \par \uc2 The medicine was covered by her insurance plan because the family had already met its out-of-pocket maximum.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Orosz, 28 years old, said the social media campaign taken up by parents "has been very effective in getting people angry\u8230\'20\'26but not in getting Mylan to lower their prices."\par \par \uc2 Mylan said it would also offer to ship its new generic product to patients, which would keep their costs at $300 or less.\par \par \uc2 Joe Crowther, an accountant in Kennewick, Wash., said he was skeptical of Mylan's efforts. He recently found that his 11-year-old son's EpiPen prescription would cost $698 at \uc2 Costco\uc2 , with $519 coming from his own pocket. He said he would wait before replacing the expired devices.\par \par \uc2 "They're just trying to put a carrot out there, hoping the whole thing will quiet down," Mr. Crowther said.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts said Mylan's generic launch could help relieve pressure on the company, and could even give it a head-start against competitors that aim to launch their own generic versions of EpiPen, including \uc2 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Even so, Mylan's generic product is likely to cannibalize sales of its more-profitable branded product, they said.\par \par \uc2 Mylan's average revenue per prescription could be reduced by 25% after the generic is launched, said Ronny Gal, a \uc2 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co\uc2 . analyst.\par \par \uc2 Write to Joseph Walker at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:joseph.walker@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 joseph.walker@wsj.com}}}\uc2 , Ron Winslow at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ron.winslow@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ron.winslow@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Anne Steele at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Anne.Steele@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Anne.Steele@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mylans-epipen-price-increases-highlight-its-grip-on-the-market-1472154769"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mylan Reacts to EpiPen Backlash}}}\uc2  (Aug. 26)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/under-pressure-for-raising-prices-mylan-boosts-assistance-on-epipen-1472125304"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mylan Boosts Assistance for EpiPen}}}\uc2  (Aug. 25)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mylan-faces-scrutiny-over-epipen-price-increases-1472074823"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mylan Faces Scrutiny Over EpiPen Price Increases}}}\uc2  (Aug. 24)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160829ec8t0030e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The trend is fuelled not only by the rise of ecommerce but also by the dramatic increase of mobile payments to offline merchants such as supermarkets and restaurants.\par \par \uc2 The move by more Chinese consumers to switch from swiping plastic cards to scanning QR codes with mobile wallet apps knocked $20bn from banks\u8217\'20\'19 fee income in 2015, according to Kapronasia, a Shanghai-based fintech consultancy.\par \par \uc2 Settlement fees are only part of banks\u8217\'20\'19 overall revenue mix, which is dominated by interest income from loans. The bigger challenge to Chinese lenders, analysts say, comes from the way in which third-party payment providers are interposing themselves between banks and customers, depriving lenders of valuable data on consumption patterns.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CData are increasingly the new currency of choice in China as third-party payment providers move beyond payments to selling a wider range of products and services such as taxi-booking, movie tickets, and wealth management products,\u8221\'20\'1D said Zennon Kapron, founder of Kapronasia. \u8220\'20\'1CBanks are starved of the critical transaction data that would help them to provide competitive products and services.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Most users of Alipay, and rival \uc2 WeChat\uc2  Pay owned by Tencent, fund their payments by linking their traditional bank accounts to mobile wallet apps. That means traditional bank deposits are still the ultimate source of funds. But when a consumer uses Alipay or \uc2 WeChat\uc2  for payment, banks do not receive data on the merchant\u8217\'20\'19s name and location. Instead, the bank record simply shows the recipient as Alipay or \uc2 WeChat\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The loss of data poses a challenge to Chinese banks at a time when their traditional lending business is under pressure from interest-rate deregulation, rising defaults, and the need to curb loan growth following the credit binge. \b \highlight22\uc2 Big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  are seen as vital to lenders\u8217\'20\'19 ability to expand into new business lines.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn the past, commercial banks focused on servicing large enterprises and didn\u8217\'20\'19t care much about consumers. But with the macroeconomy suffering, the corporate business is facing pressure on margins on growth,\u8221\'20\'1D said Wang Xiaoyan, senior fintech analyst at 86 Research in Shanghai. \u8220\'20\'1CBanks definitely want to capture the opportunity in retail banking, but if they don't have payment and consumption data, it\u8217\'20\'19s difficult to gain consumer mindshare.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In a sign that banks recognise the importance of data, China\u8217\'20\'19s big four state-owned commercial lenders have each\u160\'00\'A0launched their own ecommerce platforms in recent years. Rong E-Gou, the platform run by \uc2 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China\uc2 , the country\u8217\'20\'19s largest lender by assets, has 30m users and reported turnover of Rmb870bn last year.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Ma Nan\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 :\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/gabewildau"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 @gabewildau  }}}\uc2 :\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160829ec8t000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Cyberthieves have a new way to hack into consumer bank accounts: mobile phones.\par \par \uc2 Malicious software programs with names like Acecard and GM Bot are gaining popularity around the world as criminals look for new and lucrative ways to attack the financial-services industry. Cyberthieves are using such so-called malware to steal banking credentials from unsuspecting consumers when they log on to their bank accounts via their mobile phones, according to law-enforcement officials and cybersecurity specialists.\par \par \uc2 It is difficult to quantify how much money has been stolen as a result of the mobile-phone malware, mostly because the thieves can access an account through any normal channel after they steal credentials through a phone. Still, the prevalence of the malware is significant enough that it has caught the attention of the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  and U.S. banking regulators.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  is seeing new types of malware specifically aimed at banking applications for the purpose of stealing account credentials, says Richard Jacobs, an assistant special agent in charge who handles cybercrimes. He has been warning the financial-services industry about the trend, which is typically aimed at large banks.\par \par \uc2 Attacks have occurred on the two most common mobile operating systems\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 .'s iOS and \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s Android. Phones typically come with built-in security protections, but the devices can still be vulnerable. On Thursday, Apple urged some iPhone users to update their software due to a security flaw that could allow a hacker to remotely take control of the operating system.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\uc2 , which brings together five banking regulatory bodies, in April updated its guidance for banks to include potential threats facing mobile financial services, including mobile-phone malware.\par \par \uc2 Ian Holmes, banking-fraud-solutions manager for \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm SAS, estimates that the Acecard malware has customized overlays to imitate 50 financial-services apps. The malware "is gaining credibility in the criminal underworld," said Mr. Holmes.\par \par \uc2 The growing threat represents a new entry point for criminals who typically steal bank credentials by other means, such as installing skimmers on automatic teller machines or by using scams targeting desktop computer users. Meanwhile, a raft of credit-card breaches in the past few years has led to a glut of stolen card numbers. These are being sold on underground websites for as little as $1 each, making them a less profitable business for cyberthieves.\par \par \uc2 The malware typically gets onto a phone when a user clicks on a text message from an unknown source or taps an advertisement on a website. Once installed, it often lies dormant until the user opens a banking app.\par \par \uc2 The malware then creates a customized overlay on the authentic banking app. This allows criminals to follow a user's movements on the phone and eventually grab credentials to the account.\par \par \uc2 This type of mobile-phone malware is gaining ground as more consumers are using banking apps and financial firms are rolling out a wider array of mobile services.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  said earlier this year that 53% of smartphone users with bank accounts had used mobile banking in the previous 12 months, up from 43% in 2011. The most common mobile-banking activity is checking an account balance.\par \par \uc2 Mobile phones are considered particularly vulnerable to hackers because consumers typically don't install anti-malware protection onto their devices.\par \par \uc2 A recent study conducted by SAS and Javelin Strategy & Research found that fewer than one-third of smartphone owners use mobile antivirus or anti-malware software on their phones. Additionally, some mobile-phone owners unknowingly make their devices vulnerable to attacks when they tamper with operating systems to run unauthorized apps.\par \par \uc2 "As a bank, you can have all the protections you want, but unless there is protection on the device, you can't protect against this kind of attack," says Ross Hogan, global head of the fraud-prevention division at \uc2 Kaspersky Lab\uc2 , a cybersecurity firm.\par \par \uc2 The rising popularity of mobile-banking malware creates yet another security headache for consumers who are increasingly turning to their mobile phones for everyday tasks from banking to shopping.\par \par \uc2 It also represents a setback for banks that are pushing customers toward digital channels as a way to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Banks typically reimburse customers for money stolen from their accounts, particularly if they notify the institution quickly after the theft occurs.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, the malware adds fields that request the customer's date of birth or Social Security number, says the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's Mr. Jacobs. Some of the more advanced forms of malware can even track verification codes that the bank may send to the customer in a text messages as a secondary authentication, cybersecurity officials said.\par \par \uc2 Once the malware captures a phone user's banking credentials, it can send them remotely to the criminal, who can use them or sell them.\par \par \uc2 Some of the bank-specific malware sells for as much as $15,000, according to people who are tracking the trend.\par \par \uc2 Bank executives say they are trying to thwart the malware by frequently updating and revising their banking applications.\par \par \uc2 They also say that the banks' security systems often can trigger alerts for unusual behavior, such as a large withdrawal or if the account is accessed from a previously unknown device or an unfamiliar location. In such cases, the bank may require additional authentication from the user.\par \par \uc2 Still, the crimes can be difficult to track because customers might not notice that a theft has occurred until well after they used their phone to log on to the account. In addition, customers may be unlikely to consider their mobile phone as an entry point for hackers if it hasn't left their possession.\par \par \uc2 Write to Robin Sidel at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:robin.sidel@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 robin.sidel@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/08/25/8-tips-to-protect-your-phone-and-money-from-hacking/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 8 Tips to Protect Your Phone and Money From Hacking}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160825ec8p002xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Hundreds of online platforms, armed with better technology and less constrained by regulation, had pledged to supply affordable credit with a speed and efficiency unmatched by the big banks.\par \par \uc2 The past year has seen rising delinquencies among the riskiest classes of borrowers, prompting those financing the loans, such as hedge funds, to rein back as regulatory agencies tightened their grip.\par \par \uc2 Fears for the future of the sector were magnified in May, when \uc2 Lending Club\uc2 , an industry bellwether, fired its chairman and chief executive over a loan mis-selling scandal. The episode hit volumes across the industry, with originations of unsecured consumer loans dropping 34 per cent between April and June against the previous quarter, according to Orchard, an \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm.\par \par \uc2 Matt Burton, chief executive of Orchard, said the \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  debacle had prompted institutions to put buying programmes on hold: "We've always known that data integrity kept investors up at night. This was another data point that made them very nervous."\par \par \uc2 The platforms have tried to keep buyers interested by increasing the rates charged to borrowers, while tightening underwriting standards.\par \par \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  said it had reduced approval rates for loan applicants this month, when it reported a net quarterly loss 20 times wider than a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Mr Burton said he expected industry-wide volumes to increase in the third quarter by between 5 and 15 per cent.\par \par \uc2 "It will come back to the fact that investors are still searching for yield and borrower demand has not changed," he said. "People still want to access to credit through online means."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160826ec8q0001k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Today we address the consequences \u8212\'20\'14 and in particular the increasingly loud complaints about them from parts of the financial industry.\par \par \uc2 One obvious challenge of ultra-low interest rates is, of course, to banks whose business model depends on promising (what are now) above-market returns on deposits. As we have noted before, the\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://on.ft.com/2aNsDP1"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 scale of this challenge is overdone  }}}\uc2  and central bankers are in any case going out of their way to\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://on.ft.com/2anhp3M"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 help banks  }}}\uc2  overcome it. But two other complaints are increasingly making themselves heard.\par \par \uc2 One is from some high-profile fund managers who\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/08/22/2172966/theres-no-yield-and-citi-isnt-going-to-take-it-anymore/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 think financial markets are \u8220\'20\'1Cbroken\u8221\'20\'1D  }}}\uc2  by low central bank interest rates. But this is largely sound and fury, signifying little more than a frustration with money no longer being free \u8212\'20\'14 that is, the disappearance of riskless securities that yield a solid return. Of course, it rather puts into question the point of fixed income fund managers\u8217\'20\'19 jobs. But as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.bradford-delong.com/2016/08/i-do-not-understand-the-view-from-the-financial-markets.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Brad DeLong points out  }}}\uc2 , it is not as if the complainers call on governments massively to expand the supply of safe assets by running much larger deficits. And as I argued on Thursday, if low bond yields result from a falling natural real rate of interest and not just the fiscal policy stance, then this is simply the world we live in.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 And it\u8217\'20\'19s a good thing the central banks are keeping policy rates low; raising them may help fixed income fund managers but at a cost to everyone else. It\u8217\'20\'19s a bit like the\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/08/26/2173352/it-really-is-very-quiet/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 anguish around low volatility  }}}\uc2  in securities prices \u8212\'20\'14 which makes it hard for traders to make money, but which if you express it as \u8220\'20\'1Cstable prices\u8221\'20\'1D sounds rather good for the rest of us.\par \par \uc2 It might seem easier to have sympathy for pension funds. The FT has this week reported in depth on what is widely seen as a\u160\'00\'A0pensions crisis. The proximate cause of this is the fall in market interest rates since the crisis, which has\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ig.ft.com/sites/pensions-interestrates-explainer/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 widened the measured gap  }}}\uc2  between pension funds\u8217\'20\'19 liabilities to retirees and the assets from which they must make good on those promises. The industry does, however, occasionally seem to protest too much. In the UK, pension fund deficits are dwarfed by\u160\'00\'A0dividend payouts to shareholders from the companies who owe the pensions. This is a distributional conflict more than a financial failure.\par \par \uc2 And that is true in a broader sense. Strictly speaking, pension fund \u8220\'20\'1Cdeficits\u8221\'20\'1D are confined to defined benefit pensions. These are promises of a specified payout in a future that may no longer offer the financial return that warrants such promises. That makes them very similar to debt financing \u8212\'20\'14 a loan is, after all, also a promise of specific nominal payouts in a future that may not produce enough for it to be possible for all such promises to be honoured. That is what makes both an overreliance on debt and on defined benefit pensions dangerous: a broken promise of a guaranteed return is more disruptive than no guarantee at all.\par \par \uc2 But the bigger question concerns not the accounting deficit in defined benefit pension funds. It is, rather, how much growth there will be in the future, from which expected pension incomes, or investment returns, can be paid. With higher growth, there will be greater returns on investments made today (and investors can have a share in this by diversifying beyond \u8220\'20\'1Csafe assets\u8221\'20\'1D, as for example\u160\'00\'A0Canadian pension funds are doing).\par \par \uc2 If growth remains low, many pension promises and other income and return expectations will be impossible to meet. But that will not be because of low nominal market interest rates. It will be because there is simply too little economic production to go around. That is a distributive conflict that will require political solutions to how to share out the losses (relative to expectations), not technocratic or financial ones.\par \par \uc2 Acting in a way that reserves a larger share of the economy for some particular interest but makes its total size smaller than it could be \u8212\'20\'14 which higher interest rates today would do \u8212\'20\'14 can only intensify that distributive conflict. Lower rates for longer would help increase the pie from which pensions and all other financial claims need to be carved out. If that leads to the\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://medium.com/@DuncanWeldon/negative-yields-the-euthanasia-of-the-rentier-political-economy-dc3131d8d85e"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 euthanasia not just of the rentier  }}}\uc2 , but of some of the financial intermediaries used to skimming the rentier\u8217\'20\'19s cream, so be it.\par \par \uc2 In the long run, everyone is better served by more strongly growth-boosting policies. That is what \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  should firmly assert when she gives her Jackson Hole speech on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Other readables\par \par \uc2 * In case you missed it: The FT\u8217\'20\'19s Robin Wigglesworth explains the threat posed to the hedge fund industry by\u160\'00\'A0crowdsourced trading algorithms and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * Ricardo Hausmann\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-harm-of-immigration-restriction-by-ricardo-hausmann-2016-08"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 takes Latin American countries to task  }}}\uc2  for being too closed to immigration, against their self-interest.\par \par \uc2 To receive Martin Sandbu\u8217\'20\'19s\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/martin-sandbu-free-lunch"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Free Lunch  }}}\uc2  by email every workday,\u160\'00\'A0 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nbe.ft.com/nbe/profile.cfm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sign up here  }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160826ec8q004jx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 The conduct of monetary policy in recent years has been deeply flawed. U.S. economic growth lags prior recoveries, falling short of forecasts and deteriorating in the most recent quarters. This week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\uc2  hosts the world's leading central bankers and academics to consider monetary reform. The task is timely and consequential, but the Fed needs a broader reform agenda.\par \par \uc2 Policy makers around the world neither predicted nor can adequately explain the reasons for current inflation readings below their targets. So it is puzzling that so many academics are pushing to raise the current 2% inflation target to a higher target of 3% or 4%. In the telling of the economics guild, the Fed's leaders should descend from the Grand Tetons with supreme assurance that their latest monetary-policy invention will remedy the economy's ills.\par \par \uc2 The Fed's leaders shouldn't take the bait. Raising the inflation target is a bad idea being considered at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.\par \par \uc2 A new inflation target would undermine the Fed's commitment to any policy framework. It would please the denizens of Wall Street who pine for still-looser Fed policy. And households would be understandably miffed to receive a new lecture on unconventional monetary policy -- this one on the benefits of higher prices.\par \par \uc2 A change in inflation targets would also add to the growing list of excuses that rationalize the economic malaise: the persistent headwinds from the crisis of the prior decade, the high-sounding slogan of "secular stagnation" and the convenient recent alibi of Brexit.\par \par \uc2 A numeric change in the inflation target isn't real reform. It serves more as subterfuge to distract from monetary, regulatory and fiscal errors. A robust reform agenda requires a more rigorous review of recent policy choices and significant changes in the Fed's tools, strategies, communications and governance.\par \par \uc2 Two major obstacles must be overcome: groupthink within the academic economics guild, and the reluctance of central bankers to cede their new power.\par \par \uc2 First, the economics guild pushed ill-considered new dogmas into the mainstream of monetary policy. The Fed's mantra of data-dependence causes erratic policy lurches in response to noisy data. Its medium-term policy objectives are at odds with its compulsion to keep asset prices elevated. Its inflation objectives are far more precise than the residual measurement error. Its output-gap economic models are troublingly unreliable.\par \par \uc2 The Fed seeks to fix interest rates and control foreign-exchange rates simultaneously -- an impossible task with the free flow of capital. Its "forward guidance," promising low interest rates well into the future, offers ambiguity in the name of clarity. It licenses a cacophony of communications in the name of transparency. And it expresses grave concern about income inequality while refusing to acknowledge that its policies unfairly increased asset inequality.\par \par \uc2 The Fed often treats financial markets as a beast to be tamed, a cub to be coddled or a market to be manipulated. It appears in thrall to financial markets, and financial markets are in thrall to the Fed, but only one will get the last word. A simple, troubling fact: From the beginning of 2008 to the present, more than half of the increase in the value of the S&P 500 occurred on the day of Federal Open Market Committee decisions.\par \par \uc2 The groupthink gathers adherents even as its successes become harder to find. The guild tightens its grip when it should open its mind to new data sources, new \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , new economic models, new communication strategies and a new paradigm for policy.\par \par \uc2 The second obstacle to real reform is no less challenging. Real reform should reverse the trend that makes the Fed a general-purpose agency of government. Many guild members believe that central bankers -- nonpartisan, high-minded experts -- are particularly well-suited to expand their policy remit. They fail to recognize that central-bank power is permissible in a democracy only when its scope is limited, its track record strong and its accountability assured.\par \par \uc2 The Fed is suffering from a marked downturn in public support. Citizens are rightly concerned about the concentration of economic power at the central bank. Long after the financial crisis, the Fed holds trillions of dollars of assets that would otherwise be in private hands. And it appears to make monetary policy with the purpose of managing financial asset prices, including bolstering the share prices of public companies.\par \par \uc2 With the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the Fed claims the mantle of reform. It now micromanages big banks and effectively caps their rate of return. The biggest banks' growth in market share corresponds to that of their principal regulator. They are joint-venture partners with the Fed, serving as quasipublic utilities. As the dispenser of fault and favor, the Fed is contributing to the public perception of an unfair, inequitable economic system. Real reform this is not.\par \par \uc2 Most gathered in Jackson Hole will judge that the Fed's aggressive actions are necessary and wise. Even if that were true, the Fed finds itself in an increasingly untenable position. Congress will tag the Fed for its failures, and the public will assail the Fed for favoritism for its ostensible successes.\par \par \uc2 In the best of circumstances, the U.S. economy will accelerate to "escape velocity." In that event the Fed might get the benefit of the public doubt.\par \par \uc2 If, as is more likely, the economy is closer to recession than resurgence, the Fed is poorly positioned to respond with force, efficacy and credibility. The Fed is vulnerable. Its recent centennial as our nation's central bank shouldn't be confused with its permanent acceptance in the American political system.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warsh, a former member of the \uc2 Federal Reserve board\uc2 , is a distinguished visiting fellow in economics at \uc2 Stanford University's Hoover Institution\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Mr. Warsh Is Right: The Fed Needs the Basics" -- WSJE Aug. 31, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20160826000033"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020160826ec8q0000u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc78}{\*\bkmkend toc78}\b \uc2 Drugmaker Stung by EpiPen Backlash --- Mylan says it will assist more patients in covering cost of allergy treatment\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jonathan D. Rockoff   \par \uc2 1,247 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Mylan NV\uc2  raced Thursday to counter a firestorm of criticism over its pricing of lifesaving EpiPens, saying it would help more patients cover their out-of-pocket costs. But the drugmaker didn't lower the list price, and its stranglehold on the market means it is unlikely to face competitive pressure to do so.\par \par \uc2 EpiPen, whose list price has climbed nearly 550% over eight years, dominates the more than $1 billion market to treat serious allergic reactions because of Mylan's effective marketing and lobbying, aggressive defense of its turf and the relatively high costs of manufacturing such sterile injections, analysts say.\par \par \uc2 A backlash over Mylan's pricing tactics is shedding light on its grasp of the market. On Thursday, after politicians, physicians and lawmakers criticized the price of EpiPen, Mylan offered to provide more financial help to patients, saying it would cover their insurance out-of-pocket costs up to $300, from $100 previously. It also said it would expand the number of low-income patients eligible to receive company subsidies.\par \par \uc2 But the company didn't roll back EpiPen's high list price.\par \par \uc2 Since acquiring the rights to sell EpiPen in late 2007, Mylan has increased the list price of a pack of two to $608.61. The two most recent price increases, last November and this May, came after \uc2 Sanofi SA\uc2 's competing Auvi-Q was recalled, according to \uc2 Truven Health \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The absence of real competition is a factor in Mylan's ability to keep raising the list price of EpiPen, analysts say.\par \par \uc2 "It seems like there is not much we can do simply because we don't have options -- it's Mylan," says Roo Ciambriello, a writer in New Haven, Conn., who has three daughters, two of which have severe food allergies. She runs a website, Scratch or Sniff, in which parents have been exploring what to do to control the costs and help less-fortunate families struggling to afford the products.\par \par \uc2 "With Auvi-Q off the market, I'm a consumer without choices, and we have to live with the choices made by pharmaceutical companies," Ms. Ciambriello says.\par \par \uc2 Because EpiPens generally expire after a year, Ms. Ciambriello says she must buy eight packs of EpiPens so they are handy at home, school and to carry, purchases which she says can cost her family thousands of dollars under her high-deductible health plan. "It's adding to the stress of a food-allergy parent," she says.\par \par \uc2 Melissa Lawhon, from St. Marys, W. Va., says she buys three new EpiPens every year for her 12-year-old son, who is allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts and tree nuts. She also just switched to a high-deductible insurance plan. "I went to get his new prescription and just about died when I heard it was over $600," she says.\par \par \uc2 She contacted both her senators and the state attorney general's office to complain. "People will let their EpiPens expire and not replace them because they're so expensive, so they'll go without them and play Russian Roulette that they can keep their kids safe. That's dangerous. Accidents happen. We've used ours three times."\par \par \uc2 The EpiPen delivers a shot of epinephrine, a synthetic version of adrenaline, for which the patent expired long ago. Mylan's special ingredient is the hand-held delivery device that allows users to easily inject themselves in an emergency.\par \par \uc2 Making such sterile injectables is expensive because of the need to keep out contaminants at every step, adding another hurdle for any rival.\par \par \uc2 The upfront costs on that are "pretty high," says David Lebo, a Temple University professor specializing in pharmaceutical manufacturing.\par \par \uc2 A few competitors have tried but so far have failed at challenging EpiPen. Auvi-Q was prescribed 353,600 times last year, according to \uc2 IMS Health\uc2 , before \uc2 Sanofi\uc2  was forced to recall the product because of dosing problems. It is still off the market.\par \par \uc2 Other brands weren't nearly as successful. They "couldn't get a lot of market share. Doctors just wrote EpiPen on prescriptions," says Ronny Gal, a \uc2 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co\uc2 . analyst.\par \par \uc2 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd\uc2 . has sought to sell a generic version. But Mylan has said that Teva's version endangers patients trained to use the EpiPen, because Teva's isn't an exact copy.\par \par \uc2 In February, the \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  rejected Teva's application for approval, the company said, without specifying the reasons. "Teva expects that its epinephrine product will be significantly delayed and that any launch will not take place before 2017," the company said.\par \par \uc2 The attention on EpiPen pricing has raised anew criticisms of high drug costs generally, while also putting Mylan and its executives, in particular, under scrutiny. Last year, the company incorporated in the Netherlands and moved its tax residence to the U.K., in a so-called inversion deal. \uc2 Heather Bresch\uc2 , the company's chief executive, received an 8.3% pay raise that lifted her base salary to $1.3 million last year, and had total compensation of $18.9 million, according to a Mylan securities filing.\par \par \uc2 A Mylan spokeswoman pointed to Ms. Bresch's public comments on CNBC Thursday. In the interview, Ms. Bresch sought to shift blame for high patient costs to insurers who set high deductibles and drug-benefit managers who make money by negotiating bigger discounts off increasing list prices.\par \par \uc2 "The irony is the system incentivizes high prices," she said.\par \par \uc2 Critics counter that drug companies like Mylan fuel the high costs by refusing to disclose the discounts they negotiated, and that high prices for treatments like EpiPen force health insurers to raise deductibles for policyholders to make their monthly premiums more affordable.\par \par \uc2 Wells Fargo Securities analyst David Maris says Mylan's new moves appeared to simply shift the heavy costs of paying for the drug. "The price is not dropping. In other words, it appears that some insurance companies and those patients covered by good insurance plans will continue to pay current prices and see no discounts," he wrote in a note to investors.\par \par \uc2 Rivals haven't always competed with EpiPen by undercutting its price. For a time last year before it was recalled, Auvi-Q listed for roughly the same price as EpiPen, according to Truven's wholesale acquisition cost records.\par \par \uc2 Impax Laboratories Inc\uc2 . raised the price of another rival, called Adrenaclick, to about the same level a week before Auvi-Q's recall in late October 2015. \uc2 Impax\uc2  "can only manufacture so much product" because plant workers assemble the components by hand, says \uc2 Mark Donohue\uc2 , a company spokesman. The company is investing in automating the manufacturing of Adrenaclick, he says, but it will take a few years.\par \par \uc2 The market's pricing power speaks to Mylan's successful brand building. The company effectively stoked demand for the emergency allergy treatments after acquiring EpiPen rights in late 2007. Mylan launched a marketing campaign that raised awareness of the dangers posed by peanut and other allergies, along with the need to be prepared for severe reactions. The efforts increased demand for emergency treatments, especially among parents whose children have allergies.\par \par \uc2 With the help of patient groups, the company also lobbied governments to encourage the ready supply of EpiPens in schools and other public places, much like defibrillators.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Melinda Beck contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160826000114"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160826ec8q0003h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- One of the thorniest tasks awaiting a seven-member board charged by Washington with cleaning up Puerto Rico's debt crisis is deciding how to balance a $70 billion debt load with nearly $43 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.\par \par \uc2 The issue is coming to a head now because the White House is set to name as soon as next week the members of that oversight board, drawn from lists of candidates submitted by congressional leaders in both parties.\par \par \uc2 Puerto Rico's constitution calls for the island to pay its general-obligation bonds ahead of public services or pensions, but a law signed by President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in June clouds that hierarchy by directing the new board to ensure pensions are adequately funded.\par \par \uc2 For the oversight board, "there are no good options here," said \uc2 Matt Fabian\uc2 , a partner at research firm Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Cutting payouts to debtholders ahead of pensions will inflame creditors, but cutting pension payments to plan members could accelerate the migration and economic decline that the oversight board is tasked with stemming.\par \par \uc2 Creditors fired a pre-emptive volley last month when they sued the island's government in federal court after it passed a budget that increases funding for pensions without setting aside money for debt payment. The budget diverts "vast resources to purposes that apparently enjoy political favor but are indisputably junior to constitutional debt," the complaint said.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit was brought by hedge-fund firms that include \uc2 Aurelius Capital Management LP\uc2 , Monarch Alternative Capital LP and Stone Lion Capital Partners LP.\par \par \uc2 Puerto Rico missed more than $900 million in payments on $2 billion in debts due July 1, including its first-ever default on general-obligation debt.\par \par \uc2 Bond investors fear that favorable treatment for pensioners in Puerto Rico will reinforce earlier precedents set in distressed municipal workouts in cities such as Detroit and Stockton, Calif. "Pensioners will see a better recovery than all or most bondholders," Mr. Fabian said. "They just can't swallow haircuts like bondholders can."\par \par \uc2 Puerto Rico's three public pensions have about $2 billion in assets against $45 billion in liabilities, a shortfall far worse than any U.S. state pension system. The pensions are on track to exhaust their assets by 2019. The government would have to spend $700 million annually, or about 8% of revenue, to maintain current benefit payments.\par \par \uc2 The problems facing Puerto Rico are an extreme version of one that states face in the coming decades. Governments have funded an array of promises to public employees with debt that is growing faster than the population as a whole. The challenges are particularly dire in Puerto Rico because teachers and police officers don't participate in Social Security, leaving them with no fallback if pensions are reduced.\par \par \uc2 Obama administration officials already have signaled that debt restructuring needs to prevent further collateral damage to Puerto Rico's economy. "If people leave the island because they're not willing to work and pay into a system that isn't going to pay any benefits, how is that going to help the bondholders?" said Treasury Secretary \uc2 Jacob Lew\uc2  on a May visit to the island.\par \par \uc2 For years, Puerto Rico borrowed more -- and incurred higher fixed costs -- to buy time to stave off deeper economic overhauls. With government payrolls down over the past decade, pension funds have fewer workers contributing. Shortly after taking office in 2013, Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla signed an overhaul of the territory's public pension fund, raising retirement ages, reducing some benefits and boosting worker contributions.\par \par \uc2 Until that overhaul took effect, Irba Batista, 55 years old, would have been eligible to retire this year and take a pension worth 65% of her salary. The changes will leave her with a smaller payout after she turns 62. Her husband, who she must care for because he is blind, collects a $1,500 monthly government pension.\par \par \uc2 Some of the pension funds' assets aren't liquid because they have been lent to plan members. The funds have extended around $1 billion in mortgages and personal loans, including loans of up to $5,000 for "cultural travel."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Batista, who works for the public sports and recreation agency, said she borrowed from the pension fund to pay off bills, including surgery for her husband, and to fix up their home in Carolina, east of San Juan. She doubts that her son, who is studying in Texas, will return after he graduates. "There's no employment here," she said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160826000078"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160826ec8q0002h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 LONDON -- \uc2 Barclays PLC\uc2 's balance-sheet diet is accelerating, with a drumbeat of deals expected to close in the coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 The British bank is set to announce the completion of the sale of its Italian retail business in the coming days, according a person familiar with the matter. \uc2 Barclays\uc2 's Iberian credit-card unit is also on track to be sold, and the bank is in advanced discussions with two bidders for its Egyptian franchise, this person said.\par \par \uc2 Investors are watching the global retreat carefully. Like other European banks, \uc2 Barclays\uc2  is looking to pare its sprawling business amid low interest rates and increased regulatory pressure. Chief Executive \uc2 Jes Staley\uc2  pledged to unload GBP 35 billion ($46.3 billion) of unwanted assets by the end of 2017 to bolster its capital levels. To soak up losses on the sales, the bank cut dividend payouts in 2016 and 2017.\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2 's return on equity, a measure of profitability, was 4.8% in the first half of the year. Once unwanted assets are stripped out, the bank's management hopes returns will tick-up into double digits.\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2  announced in December that it had agreed to sell its Italian retail business to CheBanca, part of the banking group \uc2 Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA\uc2 . \uc2 Barclays\uc2  will book a loss of about GBP 200 million, but some GBP 500 million of risk-adjusted assets will be stripped off its balance sheet. The Italian bank employs 400 people and has 89 branches.\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2  said on Wednesday it netted GBP 615 million selling its risk-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business to Bloomberg. Other deals in the pipeline include selling the bank's Asian wealth business and shedding more of its 50% stake in \uc2 Barclays Africa\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The bank is also in the process of disposing of its French retail unit.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20160826000044"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020160826ec8q00015\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

So far 23 nations accounting for just over 1 per cent of the total have done so.\par \par \uc2 Several senior government climate officials said this year they did not expect ratification before 2017, but some experts have come to consider that likely. The Climate \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  research group said it expected at least 57 countries to have ratified the accord by the end of the year, accounting for 59.88 per cent of emissions.\par \par \uc2 Between them the G20's two largest members, the US and China, emit nearly 40 per cent of the greenhouse gas total. Each has indicated that it will formally join the Paris agreement this year.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to the G20 leaders, who are set to meet in Hangzhou, China, on September 4 and 5, investors said countries that joined the pact early would benefit from increased "policy certainty" and be better able to attract low-carbon investment.\par \par \uc2 The investors also want to countries to develop plans to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and use "economically meaningful" carbon pricing.\par \par \uc2 G20 nations pledged to phase out "inefficient" fossil fuel subsidies in 2009, but a study last year showed they were providing $444bn annually in financial support.\par \par \uc2 The call for a doubling of clean energy investment may also prove challenging. A record $329bn was invested globally in wind farms, solar farms and other clean-energy ventures last year, nearly a third of which was in China, figures from the Bloomberg New Energy Finance research group show. But investment was 12 per cent lower in the first quarter of 2016 than in the same period last year, mainly because of a sharp drop in China.\par \par \uc2 The share of electricity that G20 countries are generating from renewable sources such as wind farms and solar parks rose more than 70 per cent between 2010 and 2015, according to research commissioned by the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  this month.\par \par \uc2 Organisations in North America, Europe and other regions co-ordinated the investors' letter.\par \par \uc2 Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents European investors, said the Paris accord offered a clear signal that the transition to a low-carbon economy was "inevitable and already under way".\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160824ec8o0001k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Whether being used to brew a beer or assess a risk model, SigOpt wants to make \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  models better.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 -backed software company said it raised $6.6 million in funding led by \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 . Andreessen also led the company's seed round, and SV Angel, \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  and \uc2 Blumberg Capital\uc2  joined as new investors.\par \par \uc2 The investment is one of the first that \uc2 Martin Casado\uc2 , a new general partner at \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , has made. He joined the firm earlier this year after founding Nicira Networks Inc. He said he came to know the company because the firm had also invested in his company, and he heard a lot of buzz about SigOpt at the seed stage.\par \par \uc2 "We have this shared history together," he said.\par \par \uc2 SigOpt offers software that helps data scientists and engineers fine-tune their \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  models. As such models become more prevalent and complex, SigOpt thinks this technology will be more essential.\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive Scott Clark first began working on the technology behind SigOpt while a doctorate student at \uc2 Cornell University\uc2 . He realized that many graduate students were spending their time hand-tuning existing systems.\par \par \uc2 "It was a huge waste of resources," he said. "I thought there's got to be a better way."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clark then focused on this problem as he completed his degree in applied math. Later, while working at \uc2 Yelp Inc\uc2 ., he saw these optimization problems weren't limited to academics. He worked on improving the models that powered the company's advertising platform.\par \par \uc2 Now SigOpt applies its optimization algorithms to a variety of business problems, and it has worked with banking, insurance, consumer packaged goods and trading industries. Customers include \uc2 MillerCoors\uc2 , \uc2 Prudential\uc2  and \uc2 Johnson&Johnson\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It also offers a free tier of its product to academics, who use it to tackle the same problems Mr. Clark initially faced as a graduate student.\par \par \uc2 Existing investor Data Collective also participated in the round. Mr. Clark said the company will use the new funding to increase its team and improve its platform.\par \par \uc2 Write to Cat Zakrzewski at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Cat.Zakrzewski@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Cat.Zakrzewski@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160824ec8o004mq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Qataris are betting on the Empire State Building.\par \par \uc2 An affiliate of the \uc2 Qatar Investment Authority\uc2  bought a 9.9% stake in \uc2 Empire State Realty Trust\uc2 , the landlord that owns the 1,250-foot skyscraper, the company said Tuesday. The $622 million investment marks the latest injection of foreign money into New York real estate.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Empire State Realty Trust\uc2  owns properties in Manhattan, Westchester County and Connecticut, the Empire State Building is its most valuable building, generating more than 30% of its revenue last year.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Qatar Investment Authority\uc2 , which manages investments for the natural gas-rich Middle Eastern country, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 John Kessler\uc2 , \uc2 Empire State Realty Trust\uc2 's president, said in a statement the company welcomed "one of the most sophisticated and reliable real-estate investors in the world as our partner."\par \par \uc2 Foreign money has flooded the Manhattan commercial real-estate market in the past few years as foreign governments and investment funds looked for riskier investments that produce more income than government bonds. Deep-pocketed buyers from China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East are putting billions into the highest profile developments, including Hudson Yards on the far West Side and a series of slim condominiums rising south of Central Park.\par \par \uc2 Other iconic buildings have sold outright: Chinese insurer Anbang Insurance Group, for example, bought the Waldorf Astoria Hotel for nearly $2 billion early last year.\par \par \uc2 The steady stream of foreign cash, in turn, has helped push Manhattan commercial property prices to all-time highs. The market is so heated that many of the city's largest local landlords have stopped acquiring properties\u8212\'20\'14waiting for the cycle to turn.\par \par \uc2 The Qataris have made a notable push of late, committing more than $5 billion to Manhattan real estate over the past two years, according to data tracker \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 . The bulk of that sum is an investment in \uc2 Brookfield Property Partners\uc2 ' giant Manhattan West development just west of Penn Station, where the developer is building two office towers and an apartment building.\par \par \uc2 Despite its prominence, the Empire State Building rents for substantially less than skyscrapers in more prime locations by Central Park. But it has attracted some of the biggest names in real estate to fight over its control, including Leona Helmsley and Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 Empire State Realty Trust\uc2  is a company that was taken public in 2013 by New York's Malkin family, which at the time controlled the trophy tower and the 18 other properties that were included in the company.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Malkin\uc2  remains the company's chairman and chief executive. His family's ties to the building date back to 1961, when his grandfather Lawrence Wien and Harry Helmsley took control.\par \par \uc2 Peter Grant contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 We Want to Hear From You\par \par \uc2 Have something to say about an article in Greater New York?

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Tableau Software Inc\uc2 ., a maker of data-visualization software whose stock tumbled earlier this year on a sluggish sales outlook, hired a former \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . executive as its new president and chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Tableau named \uc2 Adam Selipsky\uc2 , 49 years old, to run the Seattle company. Mr. Selipsky previously ran sales and marketing at \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2 , the retailer's unit that rents computing time and storage to other companies. Mr. Selipsky succeeds \uc2 Christian Chabot\uc2 , Tableau's co-founder and current CEO. Mr. Chabot, 44, will remain chairman of Tableau's board.\par \par \uc2 Tableau is among several business-software makers having trouble living up to investor expectations. Its shares are down 42% so far this year; they fell by nearly half in one day in February when Tableau reduced its projected revenue for the year.\par \par \uc2 Brent Thill, an analyst with \uc2 UBS Group AG\uc2 , lauded Tableau's technology, but said it has struggled to close big, complex deals with large corporations. He believes Mr. Selipsky's experience at Amazon should help Tableau address the problem. "Who's the darling in tech? It's AWS," Mr. Thill said. Tableau "just hired a top guy from them."\par \par \uc2 Tableau shares were ahead 13% at $62.20 in Tuesday afternoon trading.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Selipsky has worked for AWS for more than a decade before stepping down earlier this month. Before that, he was an executive at \uc2 RealNetworks Inc\uc2 ., a Seattle company that sells internet streaming technology and services.\par \par \uc2 While Tableau is an AWS partner, last year the retail giant began to encroach on Tableau's turf, unveiling its own data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  tool, called Amazon QuickSight. At the time, Mr. Selipsky told The \uc2 Seattle Times\uc2  that Amazon is "selectively targeting" niches where its customers want more capability. Mr. Chabot, who founded Tableau in 2002 with \uc2 Chris Stolte\uc2  and \uc2 Pat Hanrahan\uc2 , has served as the company's CEO for 14 years.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20160824000035"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020160824ec8o0003x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

They Are Anyone's Guess; Most agree commercial real estate is down since Brexit, but estimates differ over how much\b0\par\par\uc2 By Art Patnaude \par \uc2 945 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 August 2016\par 20:06\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Two months after U.K.'s vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , there is consensus that its commercial real estate is now worth less.\par \par \uc2 How much less? No one can quite agree.\par \par \uc2 Property broker CBRE estimated that property values across the U.K. fell 3.3% in July. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/uk-commercial-real-estate-values-down-3-in-july-says-msci-1471013995"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Data-firm MSCI }}}\uc2 Inc. said values fell 2.8%. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/norways-wealth-fund-returns-1-3-in-second-quarter-1471434978"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Norway's sovereign-wealth fund }}}\uc2 said it took 5% off the value of its U.K. property portfolio because of Brexit. \uc2 Aberdeen Asset Management\uc2 , which operates a U.K. property fund, at first knocked its value down 17% to reflect rapid sales but more recently said it is off 5%.\par \par \uc2 One possible cushion for the property market is the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/08/15/speculators-mount-largest-short-sterling-position-ever-as-pound-keeps-slumping/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 British pound}}}\uc2 , which has fallen about 11% since the vote, causing extra pain for foreign holders of U.K. assets but also offering a hefty discount to potential new foreign buyers.\par \par \uc2 The valuation problem reflects the difficulty of saying how much things are worth in a market that has just experienced an unusual shock. Many real-estate pros say commercial-property valuations are little more than educated guesswork when the market is stressed. Indeed, the firm that values Norway's portfolio couldn't come up with a post-Brexit number; to arrive at its discount, Norway's fund managers simply took a pre-Brexit figure and knocked off 5%.\par \par \uc2 It doesn't help that few transactions are taking place. Since June 24, the day after the referendum, there have been $2.9 billion of deals in the U.K., compared with nearly $9.5 billion in the same period last year, according to real-estate consultancy firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Absent actual deals, valuers have had to rely more heavily on sentiment of investors and landlords, said people at property brokerages familiar with the appraisal process.\par \par \uc2 Another challenge: Discounts on deals post-Brexit have varied widely, with one brokerage seeing deals priced at 2% to 19% less than values before the referendum, said a person with knowledge of the deals.\par \par \uc2 Fund managers under pressure to sell took bigger hits. Aberdeen sold a central London building to Norway's oil fund for \u163\'00\'A3124 million ($163 million), nearly 20% less than where the price was before Brexit, brokers close to the deal said.\par \par \uc2 On the flip side, U.K. property firm \uc2 British Land PLC\uc2  sold a building in downtown London with almost no discount for \u163\'00\'A3400 million, different brokers said.\par \par \uc2 The Brexit referendum had a clear impact on the U.K. real-estate sector. Asset managers, Aberdeen among them, halted trading on their U.K. property funds as investors tried to pull their money out. Share prices of U.K. landlords dropped sharply. Deal making dried up.\par \par \uc2 Most analysts have expected property values to fall. The uncertain nature of Britain's relationship with the rest of the \uc2 EU\uc2 , and especially the status of London's giant finance sector, have pushed off business decisions, including whether to rent or buy new office space. Even before Brexit, investors were warning that U.K. commercial real-estate prices would deflate after a multiyear property boom.\par \par \uc2 Political and economic uncertainty after Brexit has posed a challenge for commercial-property valuers who need to assess the broader market when valuing individual properties, said Fiona Haggett, U.K. valuation director at the \uc2 Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "When you're valuing in an uncertain market, you must use all the information you've got," Ms. Haggett said. "But bear in mind, much of that information predates the referendum result."\par \par \uc2 Given the wide gaps and low volume of sales, people responsible for valuing properties at major real-estate firms, such as CBRE, \uc2 Jones Lang LaSalle\uc2  and \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield Inc\uc2 ., have had to rely on opinions of the property owners and investors, who are typically their clients, people familiar with the process said.\par \par \uc2 Some landlords have been telling valuers that values haven't changed because, so far, Brexit hasn't had a visible impact on the economy, while demand has remained robust as investors hunt for yield amid ultralow interest rates.\par \par \uc2 Other landlords and asset managers have suggested that values did fall but only marginally; property values slipping after Brexit would meet expectations but at the same time suggest the market wasn't collapsing, one person familiar with the deals said. "This looks good. It shows property as a sector is resilient," the person said.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, investors on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-go-bargain-hunting-for-u-k-property-1468902601"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 lookout for bargains }}}\uc2 are typically after bigger discounts, so valuers have tried to incorporate the likelihood that sellers' expectations won't be met, the person said.\par \par \uc2 Immediately after the referendum, Norway's sovereign-wealth fund hired \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield\uc2  to assess the value of its portfolio. It later made its own assessment, landing on the 5% reduction as "our best estimate of the real value," said Trond Grande, deputy chief executive of \uc2 Norges Bank Investment Management\uc2 , which manages the fund.\par \par \uc2 Aberdeen, the only asset manager that reopened trading in its property fund, said in a recent briefing paper that "valuing the properties and the fund is much harder in a stressed market."\par \par \uc2 The challenge facing valuation has eased in recent weeks, said Ms. Haggett at RICS. As investors return from summer vacation, analysts expect transaction volumes to pick up, providing a clearer picture of the post-Brexit property market.\par \par \uc2 "Valuation is one of those funny things, a combination of art and science," Ms. Haggett said. "It's all about understanding your market."\par \par \uc2 Write to Art Patnaude at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:art.patnaude@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 art.patnaude@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160823ec8n008px\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Eric Ben Artzi, the former risk officer who helped to expose false accounting at \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 , this week shocked Wall Street by refusing a multimillion-dollar whistleblower award from the \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Were he to take it, he calculates that his share of the $16.5m payout - split with another former Deutsche banker - would net more than $3m, after lawyers' fees and 50 per cent of the award due to his ex-wife in a divorce settlement.\par \par \uc2 He says that he is refusing the money because he thinks the bankers responsible for the malfeasance, not the German bank's shareholders, should have paid the $55m fine handed out by the SEC.\par \par \uc2 The real culprit, he claims, is a "broken" US justice system that allows officials to rotate between the SEC and institutions such as Deutsche. In turning down the reward, he is in effect blowing the whistle a second time.\par \par \uc2 "You have bad CEOs everywhere, but as long as you have a functioning justice system, this is going to be corrected somehow," Mr Ben Artzi told the FT this week in Herzliya, Israel, where he now works for a fintech start-up. "But it feels like parts of the legal system in America are driven by money, not justice."\par \par \uc2 Mr Ben Artzi says that he is not independently wealthy; he is from a prominent but middle-class family. His father is a mathematics professor at \uc2 Jerusalem's Hebrew University\uc2 ; his aunt is Sara Netanyahu, the wife of \uc2 Benjamin Netanyahu\uc2 , the prime minister. His brother Jonathan, a UK-based mathematician, served a two-year jail and detention sentence for refusing Israeli military service as a conscientious objector.\par \par \uc2 Mr Ben Artzi says his finances took a permanent hit after he blew the whistle at Deutsche which, he says, has been a "career killer".\par \par \uc2 Nor is the 43-year-old Israeli religious; he describes himself as secular. "People think if you give up your money, you're either religious or crazy. This is the Golden Calf: people worshipping money above everything, people selling their values and ethics."\par \par \uc2 Mr Ben Artzi grew up between Israel and the US, where his father had academic appointments in Berkeley and Los Angeles. After military service in the Israeli navy he moved back to the US and did his PhD in maths at \uc2 New York University\uc2 . When he graduated in 2006, mathematicians were streaming into "quant" jobs on Wall Street, and he joined them.\par \par \uc2 At his first job, with \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 , he was taken aback by the coziness between the bank's structured credit desk and rating agencies. From Citi he moved to \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and then in 2010, to Deutsche.\par \par \uc2 Once there, he says, it became clear that "something was off", as he puts it, with the bank's credit derivatives portfolio. Leveraged trades were being presented as unleveraged: the equivalent perhaps of a car dealer trying to pass off a used \uc2 Kia\uc2  as a \uc2 BMW\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 When he asked colleagues, he says he was told an investigation was under way and discouraged from talking to the SEC. In November 2011 he was fired.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche has said it valued the derivatives portfolio appropriately.\par \par \uc2 Unable to pay rent on his flat, he moved his family to Washington State, then to his wife's native Ohio, where he took a teaching job with a five-figure salary. The couple's marriage subsequently broke down.\par \par \uc2 Mr Ben Artzi is now rebuilding his life. His salary at BondIT, the Israeli company where he works, is a fraction of what he made at Deutsche, but he is enthusiastic about its work in applying \b \highlight22\uc2 big data analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to bond investing.\par \par \uc2 He hopes his decision to turn down the whistleblower's award on principle will be an example. "I hope to inspire other people to do the same," he says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160820ec8k0003a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 I just got word from the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  that I am to receive half of a $16.5m whistleblower award. But I refuse to take my share. My award, which comes from a fund allocated by Congress, amounts to 15 per cent of the $55m fine the SEC imposed on \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  in May 2015 after I informed regulators that my colleagues at the bank had been inflating the value of its massive portfolio of credit derivatives.\par \par \uc2 I was a risk officer at the bank, and one of the three whistleblowers who in 2010-11 reported the improper accounting internally and to regulators around the globe.\par \par \uc2 The SEC attorney who oversaw the investigation told the New York Times: "It's the only enforcement action where we allege that a major financial institution failed to properly value a significant portion of its portfolio of complex securities."\par \par \uc2 But Deutsche did not commit this wrongdoing. Deutsche was the victim. To be precise, the bank's shareholders and its rank-and-file employees who are now losing their jobs in droves are the primary victims.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, top executives retired with multimillion-dollar bonuses based on the misrepresentation of the bank's balance sheet. It is therefore especially disappointing that in 2015, after a lengthy investigation helped by multiple whistleblowers, the SEC imposed a fine on Deutsche's shareholders instead of the managers responsible.\par \par \uc2 Compare this outcome with a contemporaneous SEC enforcement action against the less connected executives of a smaller firm, Trinity Capital , and its subsidiary Los Alamos National Bank. The violations at Trinity seem similar to Deutsche, but orders of magnitude smaller. Five executives at Trinity were charged, the chief executive settled and paid a fine, and litigation continued against two senior officers.\par \par \uc2 "We will hold senior executives liable when they misstate the company's performance and fail to come clean with shareholders," explained Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.\par \par \uc2 So why did the SEC not go after Deutsche's executives? The most obvious concern is that Deutsche's top lawyers "revolved" in and out of the SEC before, during and after the illegal activity at the bank. \uc2 Robert Rice\uc2 , the chief lawyer in charge of the internal investigation at Deutsche in 2011, became the SEC's chief counsel in 2013. \uc2 Robert Khuzami\uc2 , Deutsche's top lawyer in North America, became head of the SEC's enforcement division after the financial crisis. Their boss, \uc2 Richard Walker\uc2 , the bank's longtime general counsel (he left the bank this year) was once head of enforcement at the SEC.\par \par \uc2 This goes beyond the typical revolving door story. In this case, top SEC lawyers had held senior posts at the bank, moving in and out of top positions at the regulator even as the investigations into malfeasance at Deutsche were ongoing.\par \par \uc2 This took place on the watch of \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2 , the current chair of the SEC, whose relationship with Mr Khuzami and Mr Rice dates back 20 years. She bears ultimate responsibility for the Deutsche fine.\par \par \uc2 In 2010 I joined Deutsche from \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  as a vice-president in the market-risk department. I am a mathematician and had worked in risk-modelling at other banks. When I joined Deutsche I was not made aware that an internal "investigation" was already under way into the inflated valuation of the bank's $120bn portfolio of exotic credit derivatives.\par \par \uc2 Within a few months, though, I realised something was very wrong, and I called the internal hotline. That is when I met Mr Rice. He was then Deutsche's top lawyer for compliance and regulatory affairs, and asserted that our conversations were subject to "attorney-client" privilege and could not be disclosed. I did not agree and was fired. My Wall Street career was ruined.\par \par \uc2 When I first helped the SEC investigation, the whistleblower award was a powerful incentive. My lawyers and ex-wife have a claim on a portion of my award, which I am not at liberty to reject.\par \par \uc2 Although I need the money now more than ever, I will not join the looting of the very people I was hired to protect. I never intended to turn a job in risk management into a crusade, but after suffering at the hands of the Deutsche executives I will not join them simply because I cannot beat them.\par \par \uc2 I request my share of the award be given to Deutsche and its stakeholders, and the award money clawed back from the bonuses paid to the Deutsche executives, especially the former top SEC attorneys. I would then be happy to collect any award for which I am eligible.\par \par \uc2 The writer is a vice-president of risk \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at BondIT\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160819ec8j0001l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Existing shareholders have been joined by new investors such as \uc2 Woodford Investment Management\uc2 , Winton Ventures and the Oman Investment fund.\par \par \uc2 CIC has invested \u163\'00\'A333m in 13 start-up companies, originating both from the university and from the wider Cambridge technology cluster, which Mr Christou called \u8220\'20\'1Cone of the richest seams of scientific and technological innovation in the world.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 After the new funding round, CIC will have around \u163\'00\'A395m to invest over the next two or three years. Typically, it makes investments in the \u163\'00\'A32m-to-\u163\'00\'A35m range.\par \par \uc2 Cambridge university will remain the largest shareholder in CIC, owning about a third of the company.\par \par \uc2 As the university\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cpreferred investor\u8221\'20\'1D, CIC works closely with Cambridge Enterprise, the university\u8217\'20\'19s technology transfer arm, which offers co-investment opportunities and access to pre-emption rights over companies spun out of the university.\par \par \uc2 The company operates a so-called \u8220\'20\'1Cevergreen fund\u8221\'20\'1D strategy, which provides long-term capital to support growth without being driven to seek an exit by selling shares in businesses prematurely after a fixed period.\par \par \uc2 The closest equivalents to CIC are Imperial Innovations and IP Group, both of them well-established public companies. Another similar company is the \uc2 Wellcome Trust\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s wholly-owned Syncona evergreen fund.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCambridge is well provided with seed capital funding and the university has a great record in getting businesses off the ground but it needed a better structure for sustained follow-on funding \u8212\'20\'14 which we can provide,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Christou.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur intention is to list the business in 12 to 18 months,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut of course that will depend on market conditions.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Numis Securities\uc2  acted as financial adviser, broker and bookrunner for the fundraising.\par \par \uc2 The 13 investments made so far by CIC are divided almost equally between healthcare and technology sectors. The \u163\'00\'A333m has also brought in about \u163\'00\'A370m from co-investors.\par \par \uc2 One investment has been made in Congenica, a spinout from the \uc2 Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute\uc2 , which develops computer programs to decode genetic diseases from DNA data.\par \par \uc2 Another has been made in Jukedeck, set up by a Cambridge music graduate to bring \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to music composition \u8212\'20\'14 for example, creating backing tracks for computer games and videos. The latest investment, announced last month, is in Cambridge Medical Robotics, which is developing robots to carry out minimal access, keyhole surgery.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160819ec8j0015t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FRANKFURT -- More German bankers are trading ties for T-shirts and trying to boost the country's struggling tech-startup scene.\par \par \uc2 Axel Hoerger spent 20 years rising through \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 UBS Group AG\uc2 . Last year, he shifted gears and launched a messaging app called Poltergeist.\par \par \uc2 "At some point I thought I'd seen enough in banking and decided to take a break and start something on my own," Mr. Hoerger said.\par \par \uc2 The 48-year-old, who has hired a chief executive for his venture and started a new banking job, said Poltergeist has about 200,000 users and continues to grow.\par \par \uc2 "The first few months were thrilling," he said. He is "now looking to raise funds that propel us to the next stage."\par \par \uc2 He isn't alone among German bankers with Silicon Valley dreams.\par \par \uc2 "Many of the startups we're talking with over a potential investment are founded by former bankers and business consultants," said Frank Seehaus of German venture-capital firm \uc2 Acton Capital Partners GmbH\uc2 . "Those people stand out because they know how to present the value drivers of business models."\par \par \uc2 The trend started after the financial crisis. It is picking up speed, as many European leaders are calling for more homegrown tech champions, industry officials said.\par \par \uc2 The situation is especially acute in Germany, where venture-capital firms last year invested less than $1 billion in young German companies, according to the country's private-equity and venture-capital association, BVK. Across Europe, the figure is roughly $15 billion, still dwarfed by the U.S.'s $75.3 billion, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.\par \par \uc2 Only two German companies are in the Billion Dollar Club of the world's 50 biggest startups: online fashion retailer \uc2 Zalando SE\uc2  and \uc2 Rocket Internet SE\uc2 , which itself develops startups.\par \par \uc2 For entrepreneurial bankers, the shortage of new-venture funding is an opportunity. Ex-\uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  banker Toby Triebel in 2014 founded Spotcap, an online credit platform that provides short-term loans to small and midsize enterprises.\par \par \uc2 "Whenever a portfolio in our region is looking at raising more than 20 million euros ($22.56 million), we can't just rely on Europe or just Germany," said \uc2 Martin Korbmacher\uc2 , who was chairman of \uc2 Credit Suisse AG\uc2 's German and Austrian investment bank until 2011.\par \par \uc2 He then founded Event Horizon Capital & Advisory GmbH, a firm that invests in young companies and advises startups on strategy and fundraising. Mr. Korbmacher said former colleagues initially smiled at what they called his "rather esoteric move for a banker."\par \par \uc2 His investments include Zurich-based Starmind, a knowledge-management company that uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to automatically route any employee's question to the right expert within an organization. "Europeans need to find their own solutions instead of relying on Silicon Valley," he said.\par \par \uc2 Dagmar Bottenbruch, who previously ran the German operations of Dutch lender Rabobank NV, nowis co-chief executive at Crosslend GmbH, a platform that securitizes loans of all sizes and markets them to investors. "There is abundant liquidity on the market," she said, "but it doesn't flow to where it's needed."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160819000046"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160819ec8j00018\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Venkat   \par \uc2 478 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)\par \uc2 AWSJ\par B2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SINGAPORE -- \uc2 Singapore Telecommunications Ltd\uc2 . has agreed to buy stakes in the largest telecommunications companies in Thailand and India for 2.47 billion Singapore dollars (US$1.84 billion) from state investment company \uc2 Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SingTel\uc2  will acquire a 21% stake in Thailand's \uc2 Intouch Holdings PCL\uc2 , and will boost its stake in India's \uc2 Bharti Telecom Ltd\uc2 . by an additional 7.39%.\par \par \uc2 The move is part of Singtel's strategy to increase growth beyond its home market. In a filing to the \uc2 Singapore Exchange\uc2 , \uc2 SingTel\uc2  said that it would acquire these stakes through internal cash, short-term debt and from proceeds through a placement of new \uc2 SingTel\uc2  shares to \uc2 Temasek\uc2 , valued at S$1.61 billion (US$1.2 billion).\par \par \uc2 The placement of new shares to \uc2 Temasek\uc2  will see the Singapore state investment company's stake in \uc2 SingTel\uc2  rising to 52.27% from the current 51.12%.\par \par \uc2 A stake sale of Intouch as well as Bharti would give \uc2 Temasek\uc2  more cash to invest in technology and newer industries, such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and life sciences.\par \par \uc2 "As an active investor, we rebalance our portfolio from time to time. We accepted the offer after careful evaluation, and believe the potential synergies gained from the acquisitions will be positive for all \uc2 SingTel\uc2  shareholders over the long term," said \uc2 Ravi Lambah\uc2 , head of telecommunications, media & technology at \uc2 Temasek\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SingTel\uc2 , Southeast Asia's largest telecom firm and the biggest company in Singapore by market capitalization, has chased growth across the globe to expand beyond its saturated local market. The company snapped up U.S. managed-security services specialist firm Trustwave for $810 million last year. In 2012, it bought Amobee, a digital advertising firm for $321 million. \uc2 SingTel\uc2  owns substantial stakes in several telecom companies across Asia, including India's \uc2 Bharti Airtel\uc2  and Telkomsel in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Emerging economies such as Thailand and India are experiencing a rising middle class and higher disposable incomes that offer growth opportunities for companies such as \uc2 SingTel\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 With the Intouch stake purchase, \uc2 SingTel\uc2  would increase its exposure to other telecom companies in Thailand. Intouch already owns a 40.6% stake in the country's largest mobile operator, Advanced Info Service. On its own, \uc2 SingTel\uc2  has a 23.3% stake in Advanced Info.\par \par \uc2 Bharti Telecom\uc2 , owns \uc2 Bharti Airtel\uc2 , India's largest telecoms firm by number of subscribers, and now Singtel's stake in \uc2 Bharti Airtel\uc2  will rise to 47.2% from the current 39.8%\par \par \uc2 "The acquisitions are in line with the group's long-term strategy to increase its exposure to high-performing associates in its portfolio of leading telecom businesses in the region," said SingTel Chief Executive Chua Sock Koong.\par \par \uc2 Currently, earnings from overseas operations contribute more than 70% of Singtel's profit.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20160818000040"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020160818ec8j0001o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Venkat \par \uc2 739 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 August 2016\par 19:46\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Singapore Telecommunications Ltd\uc2  . has agreed to buy stakes in the two largest telecommunications companies in Thailand and India from state investment company \uc2 Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd\uc2  . for 2.47 billion Singapore dollars ($1.84 billion).\par \par \uc2 Singtel has agreed to buy a 21% stake in Thailand's largest telecommunications company \uc2 Intouch Holdings PCL\uc2  , and is looking to boost its stake in India's \uc2 Bharti Telecom Ltd\uc2  . by an additional 7.39% stake purchase.\par \par \uc2 The move is part of Singtel's strategy to lift growth beyond its home market.\par \par \uc2 In a filing to the \uc2 Singapore Exchange\uc2  , Singtel said it would acquire these stakes through internal cash, short-term debt and from proceeds through a placement of new Singtel shares to \uc2 Temasek\uc2  worth S$1.61 billion ($1.2 billion).\par \par \uc2 The placement of new shares to \uc2 Temasek\uc2  will see the state investment company's stake in \uc2 SingTel\uc2  rising to 52.27% from the current 51.12%.\par \par \uc2 Singtel, Southeast Asia's largest telecom firm and the biggest company in Singapore by market capitalization, has chased growth across the globe to expand beyond its saturated local market. The company snapped up U.S. managed-security services specialist firm Trustwave for $810 million last year. In 2012, it bought Amobee, a digital advertising firm for $321 million. \uc2 SingTel\uc2  owns substantial stakes in several telecom companies across Asia, including India's \uc2 Bharti Airtel\uc2  and Telkomsel in Indonesia.\par \par \uc2 Emerging economies such as Thailand and India are experiencing a rising middle class and higher disposable incomes that offer growth opportunities for companies like Singtel. Thailand is witnessing an increase in mobile usage and the economy grows at a steady clip. Mobile phone and data subscribers are expected to increase to more than 88 million this year, which is up 4.4% on year.\par \par \uc2 India, with a population of 1.2 billion, grew 7.9% in the first three months of this year, making it one of the fastest-growing economies of the world. According to a report by GSMA, an industry body that represents mobile operators world-wide, India is the second-biggest mobile market in terms of subscribers and the third-largest smartphone market in the world. There were 185 million smartphone connections as of mid-2015 and another half a billion are expected to be added b 2020.\par \par \uc2 The purchase of the Intouch stake will see Singtel getting increased exposure to other telecom companies in Thailand. Intouch already owns a 40.6% stake in the country's largest mobile operator \uc2 Advanced Info Services PCL\uc2  . Singtel on its own has an 23.3% stake in Advanced Info. Separately, Intouch also owns a 41% stake in Thaicom, which apart from internet and telephone services, provides direct TV satellite services.\par \par \uc2 Bharti Telecom\uc2  , which owns \uc2 Bharti Airtel\uc2  is India's largest telecommunications firm by number of subscribers and now Singtel's stake in \uc2 Bharti Airtel\uc2  will rise to 47.2% from the current 39.8%.\par \par \uc2 "The acquisitions are in line with the group's long-term strategy to increase its exposure to high-performing associates in its portfolio of leading telecom businesses in the region," said Singtel Chief Executive Chua Sock Koong. Currently, earnings from overseas operations contribute more than 70% of Singtel's earnings.\par \par \uc2 Intouch, which was founded by former Thai Prime Minister \uc2 Thaksin Shinawatra\uc2  , has been a lightning rod in local politics. \uc2 Temasek\uc2  led a consortium that bought control of the firm, then known as Shin Corp., from Mr. Thaksin and his family in 2006. \uc2 Temasek\uc2  currently has a 41% stake in Intouch, which is listed on the Thai stock exchange and has a market cap of close to $5.9 billion.\par \par \uc2 A stake sale of Intouch as well as Bharti would give \uc2 Temasek\uc2  more cash to invest in technology and newer industries, such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and life sciences. Last year, \uc2 Temasek\uc2  agreed to sell its majority stake in container shipper \uc2 Neptune Orient Lines Ltd\uc2  . for $2.4 billion to French shipping giant \uc2 CMA CGM SA\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Ravi Lambah\uc2  , head of telecommunications, media & technology at \uc2 Temasek\uc2  , said: "As an active investor, we rebalance our portfolio from time to time. We accepted the offer after careful evaluation, and believe the potential synergies gained from the acquisitions will be positive for all Singtel shareholders over the long term."\par \par \uc2 Write to P.R.

Returning investors SV Angel, Initialized Capital and Pejman Mar Ventures participated.\par \par \uc2 Heap closed on the funding in December, and has since grown its team to 40 employees from 18. Co-founder and Chief Executive Matin Movassate said the company's priorities include creating a product for Android apps and building integrations with other third-party tools, including Optimizely, \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  and Intercom.\par \par \uc2 With the new funding, Heap has raised a total of $13 million. The San Francisco-based startup faces venture-backed competitors that have raised quite a bit more. \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  -backed Mixpanel Inc. has raised $77 million. Benchmark and \uc2 Battery Ventures\uc2  -backed Amplitude \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc. has raised $26 million.\par \par \uc2 While several of Heap's competitors have added other services to their offerings, such as A/B testing and email campaigns, Mr. Movassate said Heap would only focus on its \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  offerings.\par \par \uc2 "There's so much room to make \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  better than how it works today. We want to make sure that we fully focus on making that happen," Mr. Movassate said.\par \par \uc2 Matt Murphy\uc2  , the \uc2 Menlo Ventures\uc2  partner who led the round, said he believed the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  market was becoming more competitive in terms of price and product offerings.\par \par \uc2 NEA Partner \uc2 Chetan Puttagunta\uc2  has joined the company's board.
