For their first fund they plan to raise $50 million, according to the filing.\par \par \uc2 Though the fund hasn't officially closed, the partners are already putting the money to work, leading the $4 million seed round for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.tracegenomics.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Trace }}}\uc2 , an agriculture technology company that hopes to marry genomics and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to help farmers make smarter decisions about what they plant. Other investors in the round included \uc2 Illumina Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Viking Global Investors\uc2  and Fall Line Capital.\par \par \uc2 Venture investment in agtech companies hit a new high of $208.8 million last year, according to industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2015, Trace announced the availability of its first product on Wednesday, a test for measuring pathogens in soil.\par \par \uc2 "They're using their proprietary insights into the microbiome and genomics to not only reduce disease in crops, but to predict where a disease may occur," Mr. Bilimoria said. "Ultimately this is about farmers needing to make better decisions based on data."\par \par \uc2 Trace's founding team are a pair of Stanford PhDs: Diane Wu, an expert in genomics and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and Poornima Parameswaran, whose speciality is microbiology.\par \par \uc2 Over the past year, the company has been working with pilot customers to validate its technology and on Wednesday launched its soil pathogen panel tests for diseases affecting two crops: strawberries and lettuce. Later it will roll out tests for soybeans, corn and other crops, Ms. Wu said.\par \par \uc2 She said Trace's testing technology can identify a wide range of pathogens that could be problematic for a particular crop, which makes it superior to existing tests which look for single pathogens. And later on it will expand its tests to target good bugs that help keep soil healthy, not unlike the human digestive system, which relies on a wide range of microbial flora to process food.\par \par \uc2 Trace will compete with companies such as \uc2 Eurofins Scientific\uc2 , \uc2 Agdia Inc\uc2 . and university diagnostic labs, Ms. Wu said. She added that larger companies like \uc2 DuPont\uc2 , \uc2 Monsanto Co\uc2 . and \uc2 BASF\uc2  are also doing microbial testing at far larger scale.\par \par \uc2 Still, Trace's long-term plan isn't simply to play doctor for sick soil. As it collects more and more samples, and runs them through its advanced \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms, Trace hopes to build a database that can be used predictively to help farmers make smarter, faster decisions about what crops to grow and how to manage their soil. In the end, the goal is to boost crop yields, Ms. Wu said.\par \par \uc2 "The more users use our product, the better our product will become to the users on our platform," she said.\par \par \uc2 Trace was the first investment by Refactor Capital, but one of the fund's other investments, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/clover-health-targets-as-much-as-200m-in-new-funding-round-1463777217"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Clover Health }}}\uc2 , was announced in May.\par \par \uc2 Write to Rolfe Winkler at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:rolfe.winkler@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rolfe.winkler@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160713ec7d00796\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Silicon Valley's best-known venture investors have emerged largely unscathed from the rapid descent of \uc2 Theranos Inc\uc2 ., but the decline offers a cautionary tale for a community that bets big on visionary founders touting revolutionary technology.\par \par \uc2 U.S. health regulators on Friday {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dealt Theranos a major blow by moving to revoke its license}}}\uc2  to operate a California lab and banning founder \uc2 Elizabeth Holmes\uc2  from the blood-testing business for at least two years.\par \par \uc2 Silicon Valley investors say Palo Alto, Calif.-based Theranos\u8212\'20\'14which was valued at $9 billion in a 2014 funding round\u8212\'20\'14offers lessons about the importance of oversight and due diligence in the venture-capital business, which bets sometimes on nothing more than an idea.\par \par \uc2 "For me, the Theranos saga is a wonderful reminder: While you want to invest in people who are visionary and are committed to their businesses, you want to partner with people who are truth-seeking," said health-care investor \uc2 Bryan Roberts\uc2 , a partner at Venrock. "A lot of people [involved with Theranos] fell down on that in this."\par \par \uc2 A Theranos spokeswoman said, "Theranos is taking concrete steps to back up its commitment to transparency. We are also preparing to introduce and explain our technologies to the scientific community."\par \par \uc2 Theranos said it is seeking to resolve its issues with the regulator. The most serious sanctions don't go into effect for about two months and an appeal is possible.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Holmes personified Silicon Valley's archetypal founder: A Stanford dropout who emulated \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2  and had a grand vision to disrupt an entrenched industry. Before Theranos's problems came to light last October, at least some Silicon Valley investors cheered her apparent success. \uc2 Marc Andreessen\uc2 , whose firm isn't a backer of Theranos, tweeted that Ms. Holmes would be the first female tech founder on his list of "revolutionary entrepreneurs."\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. Andreessen's firm, \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Much of Silicon Valley has since pointed out what was perhaps the company's biggest red flag: its unusual roster of investors and board members. The only big-name venture firm to invest was \uc2 Draper Fisher Jurvetson\uc2 , which along with founding partner \uc2 Tim Draper\uc2 's own fund, supplied Theranos's first $1 million. Ms. Holmes was a childhood friend of Mr. Draper's daughter and came to him "with extraordinary energy and brilliance," he has said.\par \par \uc2 Other investors include Don Lucas, an early backer of software company \uc2 Oracle Corp\uc2 .; little known \uc2 ATA Ventures\uc2 ; and \uc2 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc\uc2 ., which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/walgreen-terminates-partnership-with-blood-testing-firm-theranos-1465777062"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recently terminated}}}\uc2  a partnership to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/craving-growth-walgreens-dismissed-its-doubts-about-theranos-1464207285"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 use Theranos blood tests}}}\uc2  in some {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://news.walgreens.com/press-releases/general-news/walgreens-terminates-relationship-with-theranos-will-be-closing-operations-at-all-40-theranos-wellness-centers-in-arizona.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 of its stores}}}\uc2 . ATA and Don Lucas didn't respond to a request for comment. A Draper Fisher Jurvetson spokeswoman and a Walgreens spokesman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Several investors with expertise in life-science deals say they either passed on investing because they thought Theranos's technology claims were too good to be true, or didn't get a chance. Theranos's board of directors consisted mostly of political heavyweights rather than medical experts. The company never published its research in peer-reviewed medical journals, as is customary.\par \par \uc2 "When none of the top VC firms are in a super-hyped company, you have to wonder if there is something not quite right,'" said \uc2 Jeff Richards\uc2 , a managing partner at \uc2 GGV Capital\uc2 , which doesn't invest in medical companies.\par \par \uc2 Theranos replaced many of its directors last October and created a new medical-advisory board. The Theranos spokeswoman said, "Theranos has boards composed of individuals of extraordinary experience and talent in many fields. Their contributions have been significant."\par \par \uc2 Other highflying startups with prominent venture investors have suffered from corporate-governance issues.\par \par \uc2 Health-benefits broker \uc2 Zenefits\uc2  had a single outside board member, \uc2 Lars Dalgaard\uc2  of \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , until five months ago. He had no experience in the regulated-insurance business and encouraged the company to grow quickly and to secure the highest possible valuation in its last round of financing, say people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 In February, \uc2 Zenefits{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/02/08/zenefits-ceo-parker-conrad-resigns-over-compliance-issues/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 replaced founder Parker Conrad }}}\uc2  as chief executive and added three outside directors. \uc2 Zenefits\uc2  has since laid off staff and experienced stalled sales. It is under investigation from regulators in multiple states regarding insurance-license issues. Two weeks ago, it agreed to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/zenefits-investors-cut-valuation-by-half-1467328327"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reset the valuation}}}\uc2  for its last financing round to $2 billion from $4.5 billion.\par \par \uc2 David Sacks\uc2 , \uc2 Zenefits\uc2 's new CEO, has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/733760059268702208"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 argued that any comparisons}}}\uc2  with Theranos are unfair, because his company quickly took steps to rectify its regulatory and governance issues and replaced its founder. A Zenefits spokeswoman referred back to Mr. Sacks's tweets.\par \par \uc2 Zenefits\uc2  has shown that "absolute max growth rate isn't necessarily the right thing to optimize for," said Mr. Roberts of Venrock, which was an early investor in the company.\par \par \uc2 Some companies are moving to bolster oversight. Enlitic Inc., which applies \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to medical data, is reconstituting its advisory board with experts who are expected to take a more active role overseeing the company, a move that took on added urgency in the wake of Theranos's revelations, said board member and angel investor Jim Golden.\par \par \uc2 The Silicon Valley community also has to avoid buying into its own hype machine, said \uc2 Stephen Kraus\uc2 , a partner at \uc2 Bessemer Venture Partners\uc2 . Entrepreneurs must sell a vision of the future to attract investors and talented employees, but it can backfire when hype outpaces reality.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Holmes was adamant about staying in control at Theranos from early on, said \uc2 Sam Colella\uc2 , managing director at Versant Ventures, who recalls meeting her when she was first raising venture capital. He said he was impressed, but thought she might need management help along the way.\par \par \uc2 "\u8216\'20\'18Every company needs more gray hair,'" he said he told her. " \u8216\'20\'18What if I came to you later and asked to recruit a partner for you who has experience in building a billion-dollar company?' " Mr. Colella said the reaction was startlingly abrupt. "She closed her notebook and said, \u8216\'20\'18I'm the chairman and CEO and it's going to stay that way,' " before promptly leaving.\par \par \uc2 "Anyone who knows \uc2 Elizabeth Holmes\uc2  can tell you she has never abruptly walked out of a meeting," a Theranos spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Rolfe Winkler at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:rolfe.winkler@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rolfe.winkler@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Read More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/r_Theranos_Inc_CMS_07-07-2016_Letter.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Read the Government's Letter to Elizabeth Holmes}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/under-fire-theranos-ceo-stifled-bad-news-1468195377"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Under Fire, Theranos CEO Stifled Bad News}}}\uc2  (July 10)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Theranos Voids Two Years of Edison Blood-Test Results}}}\uc2  (May 18)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-is-subject-of-criminal-probe-by-u-s-1461019055"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Theranos Is Subject of Criminal Probe by U.S.}}}\uc2  (April 18)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjwzv3sluPNAhUGt48KHcviDWwQFggcMAA&url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901&usg=AFQjCNGdbwcMyNgIUrosj-l4xuKO_b0EYQ&sig2=1HWK34_TKh_yLigNM3l_Ew"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Hot Startup Theranos Has Struggled With Its Blood-Test Technology}}}\uc2  (Oct. 16, 2015)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160713ec7d00335\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 Even before Britain's vote to exit the \uc2 European Union\uc2  battered shares of the world's leading commercial real-estate-services firms, signs were mounting that the party was coming to an end for an industry that had boomed in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Now, as Brexit's repercussions ripple through the market, Wall Street is bracing itself for what could be a prolonged slump in the sector. Already, tenants and investors, especially in Europe, have become more wary of leasing and buying property as they reassess their real-estate activity.\par \par \uc2 A deal slowdown would reduce commissions for real-estate-services firms like Los-Angeles-based \uc2 CBRE Group Inc\uc2 ., Chicago-based JLL, Toronto-based \uc2 Colliers International Group Inc\uc2 . and London-based \uc2 Savills PLC\uc2 , a prospect that has sent the companies' shares tumbling.\par \par \uc2 Longer term, the fallout from Brexit will likely redraw the mergers-and-acquisitions map in a business that has been going through an unprecedented wave of consolidation in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Companies with low debt and untapped credit lines on their balance sheets, like CBRE and JLL, might be able to take advantage of the carnage. Their acquisition targets, especially in countries such as the U.K., might be more receptive in a post-Brexit world.\par \par \uc2 "Those people have been looking for homes," said \uc2 Colin Dyer\uc2 , chief executive of JLL, in an interview last week. "But they'll be looking even harder in the future."\par \par \uc2 But a decline in commission revenue could mean headaches for more highly leveraged firms, like \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield Inc\uc2 ., which was acquired last year by an investment group led by private-equity firm TPG and combined with Chicago-based DTZ and Washington-based \uc2 Cassidy Turley\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For Cushman, keeping up with the competition might mean having to take on more debt or get a capital infusion from ownership. Neither alternative has been particularly appealing to Cushman's management team, which has preferred to finance expansion through cash flow.\par \par \uc2 What is more, with bears rampaging in the industry, Cushman likely will need to put off its widely expected initial public offering. Analysts had predicted the IPO would come later this year or early next year. That looked possible when other firms were trading at record highs, but not today when some are trading at more than 30% discounts to that level.\par \par \uc2 "If your peers are trading poorly, your owners are going to say why am I taking this thing public now," said \uc2 Brandon Dobell\uc2 , who tracks the industry for \uc2 William Blair & Co\uc2 . "Giving away cheap equity tends to not be a great idea to put before the board."\par \par \uc2 A Cushman spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the Brexit vote has affected the firm's timing on an IPO. But she pointed out in an email that the firm's exposure to Europe is less than some of its biggest rivals.\par \par \uc2 "We are well-positioned with a very diversified revenue from all major markets around the world," she said.\par \par \uc2 A consolidation in the commercial-property services industry in recent years has been fueled partly by investors and major corporations looking to the firms to take on more real-estate roles in more countries. At the same time, firms have been trying to insulate themselves against a downturn in transactions by building and acquiring other businesses, such as property management, that get recurring fees and are less dependent on economic cycles.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, the firms have had the wind at their backs thanks in part to the enormous increase in commercial real-estate sales volume throughout the world. In 2015, a record $1.3 trillion worth of commercial property and development sites traded hands globally, according to data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 These deals boosted commission revenue and the shares of services firms. CBRE, JLL, \uc2 Savills\uc2  and Colliers all hit post-crash record highs last year.\par \par \uc2 But the real-estate rally began losing its bloom last year as deal volume began to fall and concerns grew about the health of China and other drivers of the world economy. The surprise Brexit vote added fuel to the fire.\par \par \uc2 There is now "lack of clarity" in Europe on tariffs, politics, exchange rates, the regulatory environment, imports and export and the movement of talent and skills, Mr. Dyer said. "What do people do? Slow everything down or wait until clarity emerges," he said.\par \par \uc2 To reassure post-Brexit markets, CBRE in late June issued a news release pointing out that last year the U.K. accounted for about 10% of the firm's global earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, executives at firms focused more on the U.S. market, like \uc2 Newmark Grubb Knight Frank\uc2 , say they could benefit if investors shift more of their attention away from Europe to North America.\par \par \uc2 "The more money that comes to America, the better for us," said Newmark CEO \uc2 Barry Gosin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Newmark is owned by \uc2 BGC Partners Inc\uc2 ., a spinoff of \uc2 Cantor Fitzgerald\uc2 . Shares of BGC, which also owns other financial-services businesses, also fell in the wake of Brexit, but not as much as the broader commercial real-estate-services sector.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20160713000019"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020160713ec7d0000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Its portfolio includes brands such as \uc2 MarkMonitor\uc2 , Web of Science, Thomson CompuMark and Thomson Innovation. Specialist business publishers and data companies have been the subjects of a series of big transactions in recent years, as private equity groups seek stable revenues and profits in increasingly volatile markets. Analysts said the purchase of IP&S was also part of a wider push into China and Asia, where there has been a big increase in the levels of investment in scientific research.\par \par \uc2 Jean Eric Salata\uc2  , Baring Asia chief executive, said: "We believe the outlook for the business is underpinned by an increasing shift towards more knowledge-driven economies and a continued emphasis on research and development."\par \par \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2  announced last November that it would be splitting off and selling the IP&S division as part of a "sharpening of its strategic focus".\par \par \uc2 The business accounted for just 8 per cent of its total revenues in 2014 and, under chief executive \uc2 Jim Smith\uc2  , the global information company has been looking to prioritise its three principal divisions which provide information and data to the financial and risk, legal and accounting industries.\par \par \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2  said it expected to use about $1bn of the proceeds to repurchase shares, as part of a previously announced $1.5bn buyback programme. The rest is expected to be used to pay down debt and reinvest in the business.\par \par \uc2 Shares in the Toronto-listed group rose 1.75 per cent to $54.20 Canadian dollars in early trading.\par \par \uc2 There have been several transactions involving financial data and media companies in the past few years. In 2013, \uc2 BC Partners\uc2  bought scientific publisher Springer Science for \u8364\'20\'AC3.3bn, while \uc2 Verisk \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  agreed to buy Wood Mackenzie for \u163\'00\'A31.9bn in March and \uc2 McGraw Hill Financial\uc2  proposed to buy \uc2 SNL Financial\uc2  for \u163\'00\'A32.2bn in July.\par \par \uc2 "These types of businesses are good investments for private equity groups," said Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg. "They have very high margins and have very stable subscription revenues, which means you can borrow a lot more to finance the transaction.\par \par \uc2 "This sort of deal just wouldn't be possible in a public market, as shareholders wouldn't be comfortable with the debt levels."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160712ec7c00025\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

They were up more than 3 per cent, in what was their best month since 2010, according to data from \uc2 Hedge Fund Research\uc2 , buoyed by long positions on the yen and - for the most fortunate - long on both the yen and the dollar, and short sterling.\par \par \uc2 Currencies and currency-related trades have been among the few bright spots for hedge funds recently (along with gold , which has risen more than 30 per cent since the end of 2015, according to \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 ). Riding the yen and dollar up and taking on derivative trades, such as shorting Chinese companies that have lots of US dollar debt and dollar costs, have been among the few clear trends to follow.\par \par \uc2 But generally, these are challenging times for the industry in the short and long term. For most of the year and most hedge fund strategies, 2016 has not been great. "The world has turned into Japan ," says the head of one Hong Kong-based fund. "When rates are this low, returns are low. There is too much money and too few opportunities."\par \par \uc2 It is only slowly becoming conventional wisdom that rates are not going up soon anywhere. That means the search for yield will become even more intense. The junk bond market in the US has been one beneficiary but many investors are increasing exposure to emerging markets, particularly in Latin America. "As everyone heads closer to negative rates, anywhere with yield is the place to be," says a senior executive at one big investment group. "And that includes emerging markets ."\par \par \uc2 While developed markets continue to do everything in their power to make their currencies as valueless as those of the banana republics of yesterday, it is the emerging markets (EMs) that have proved to be more responsible stewards of their currencies - or at least they have been slower to erode their value.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone's asset management group recently did a study of 90 major devaluations over the past 30 years and concluded that the worst is already over for some currencies that have recently gone through major devaluations, including the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real.\par \par \uc2 "We expect EM to outperform developed markets for a number of reasons," notes Ashmore in a recent piece of research. "EM technicals are good. Positioning is not at all crowded, because investors have broadly favoured developed market assets over EM assets since the Taper Tantrum of 2013 . Absolute valuations in EM are attractive. EM net external balances are improving sharply thanks to competitive real exchange rates. EM countries are generally growing faster, have lower debts, better demographics, room to adjust policy and [are] more isolated from the DM political crisis." Moreover, "EM central banks have more room to act. Indonesia, India, Brazil, Argentina, South Korea, Russia, Taiwan, Singapore and China all have in common that they have room to cut interest rates in the future thanks to previous positive policy actions and low inflation," Ashmore adds.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, there are strategies that might disappoint in this flat-to-negative-rate world. For example, the attractions of distressed asset investing, one of the strategies that looked particularly auspicious earlier this year, are fading. With rates so low, over-levered companies in the west, (with a few notable exceptions such as energy), can maintain their zombie status indefinitely as they have done for two decades in Japan. There is little growth and the anticipated recovery continues to remain elusive.\par \par \uc2 Longer term, disappointing performance might not be the biggest threat to the industry, with its 10,000 firms and $2.86tn of assets under management. As \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  continues to evolve, computers will not supplement managers, they will replace them. Automation is happening and as it improves with \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , firms such as Blackstone are giving more money to quant funds.\par \par \uc2 Despite all their claims, some hedge funds are not nearly as diversified as they think they are, as correlations between different geographies and products and strategies increasingly converge. The quant investors can be far more diversified. They also use more leverage, but since it is spread over a greater number of positions, it is probably safer - and given where rates are, cheaper than in the past.\par \par \uc2 henny.sender@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160712ec7c0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

Martin, Vipal Monga and Heather Gillers   \par \uc2 1,152 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)\par \uc2 AWSJ\par B5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The retirement savings of tens of millions of people have come under new threat since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , because of a plunge in global interest rates.\par \par \uc2 A post-Brexit scramble for the perceived safety of bonds pulled yields lower and upended global markets just as many public pension funds wrapped up their fiscal year on June 30, eating into any annual gains and widening already-large deficits. Many public pensions that were already having a bad year are expected this month to report their worst annual performances since the last financial crisis in 2008-09.\par \par \uc2 "We could see some pretty ugly 2016 financial statements," said \uc2 Matt Fabian\uc2 , a partner at research firm Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A sustained period of rock-bottom rates in the U.S. and negative rates overseas are contorting financial plans for investors and consumers globally, from insurers that rely on bond income to retirees who have to live with lower returns on their certificates of deposit.\par \par \uc2 For officials who manage retirements of public and private-sector workers, Brexit exacerbated problems that have been roiling pensions around the world for years. The low-rate environment has pulled down returns, inflated funding gaps, encouraged larger investment risks and prompted plan officials to scale back future investment assumptions.\par \par \uc2 Now "this problem is snowballing," said Colorado Treasurer Walker Stapleton.\par \par \uc2 Pensions determine their assets and liabilities through formulas that depend heavily on the fluctuation of interest rates. When those rates fall, investment returns suffer and obligations to future retirees become larger.\par \par \uc2 While lower rates do boost the value of existing bonds, the negatives outweigh the positives for many funds. Pensions lose money when bonds with bigger payouts purchased years ago mature and are replaced with lower-yielding securities.\par \par \uc2 The consequences of any losses are real. Large companies must compensate for weak returns and mounting obligations bypumping money into their plans, thereby devoting less to capital expenditures, acquisitions and research.\par \par \uc2 At public plans, underperformance often means taxpayers or workers are asked to pay significantly more to account for liabilities that are expected to rise as lifespans increase and more Americans retire.\par \par \uc2 "Brexit should be a wake-up call for pension plans because it means interest rates are going to stay low or go lower and it makes it even less likely [the plans] are going to achieve the 7.5% rate of return that most of them are assuming," said former San Jose, Calif., Mayor \uc2 Chuck Reed\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 New York City reduced its return target to 7% in 2013, but that assumption is likely still unrealistic, said Lawrence Golub, a financier and member of the New York State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances. The assets returned 3.5% in fiscal 2015.\par \par \uc2 "The 7% is too high for planning purposes," he said. "It's not conservative."\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the New York City Comptroller's Office said thatthe city calculates its returns over several years, which tempersthe impact of any one bad year.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Colorado Public Employees' Retirement Association\uc2  last lowered its estimate to 7.5% from 8% three years ago, but Mr. Stapleton said the number needs to go lower. The state treasurer said the impact of Britain's vote to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2  only increased that conviction because it made clear the extent to which pension funds are at the mercy of international forces.\par \par \uc2 "You can't control global events," said Mr. Stapleton, who is a member of PERA's board. "Clearly there's a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace."\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for PERA said 7.5% is "a long-term objective," not an annual target and that reforms enacted in 2010 have lowered the fund's liabilities by $15 billion.\par \par \uc2 Ted Eliopoulos\uc2 , the investment chief for the nation's largest public pension fund, the \uc2 California Public Employees' Retirement System\uc2 , told his board 10 days before Brexit that performance for the fiscal year ending June 30 was "likely to be flat, which is a nice way of saying zero." The system's consultant also dropped predictions of returns over the next decade to 6.4% annually, compared with a 2013 prediction of 7.1%.\par \par \uc2 The next three to five years will "test us," Mr. Eliopoulos said on June 13.\par \par \uc2 Corporate pension plans are also bracing for lower returns and higher deficits even though low rates affect them differently. Corporate pension funds use high-quality bonds to calculate their liabilities; if rates rise, those liabilities can fall. The sustained period of low rates has kept those pension obligations unexpectedly high.\par \par \uc2 Most corporate plans complete their funding calculations at the end of the calendar year, which gives them aboutsixmonths to recover from the first half's turmoil.\par \par \uc2 However, there are early signs that upheaval during the first half of the year made things worse. The combined pension deficit for S&P 1500 companies ballooned to $568 billion at the end of June, meaning the value of their assets wasn't enough to cover future benefits for workers, according toMatt McDaniel, U.S. head of the defined-benefits risk consulting businessat Mercer. That is a $164 billion increasein the deficitfrom the end of 2015.\par \par \uc2 Some companies are expected to pump more money into the plans to close the funding gap, and some have already borrowed money in the bond market at low rates to do so.\par \par \uc2 But there is no guarantee that approach will solve the long-term funding problem. Companies with large pension funds such as \uc2 Verizon Communications Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Raytheon Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Lockheed Martin Corp\uc2 . have been funneling billions into their pension plans in past years, with little to show for it.\par \par \uc2 Verizon\uc2 , for example, has contributed $7.7 billion into its plans since 2008. In that time, its pension deficit has more than doubled to $5.9 billion from $2.6 billion. Although \uc2 Verizon\uc2  doesn't officially measure its obligations until the end of the year, in its financial disclosures, the telecom firm notes that every 0.50 point drop in the rate it uses to measure its liabilities will increase its pension obligations by $1.3 billion.\par \par \uc2 The typical rate used by companies fell 0.77 point in June from the end of last year, according to Mercer, meaning \uc2 Verizon\uc2  could see an increase of roughly $2 billion in its pension obligations if things remain as they were at the end of June.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Verizon said that the company has strong cash flow and has taken several steps over the past few years to reduce its pension risk. \uc2 Lockheed Martin\uc2  and \uc2 Raytheon\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Companies are "running in place," said Michael Moran, a pension strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. "If the companies hadn't put that money in, it would have been even worse."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20160711000009"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020160711ec7c001pb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

But VCs are more concerned with how startups apply this technology than on the sophistication of their algorithms.\par \par \uc2 The best AI companies have a deep understanding of the problem they are trying to solve and frame their business around a solution, according to \uc2 Bain Capital\uc2  Ventures Managing Director Ajay Agarwal. In these companies "the \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  is an enabler, it's not the be all and end all of their business," Mr. Agarwal said.\par \par \uc2 Venture investors are betting that AI will enable startups such as Atomwise Inc. and NuMedii Inc. to speed the introduction of new drugs. Atomwise uses computer simulation to predict the effectiveness of drug molecules, while NuMedii aims to identify new uses for existing treatments.\par \par \uc2 But while machines can point researchers in the right direction, it still takes human expertise to apply these insights and create medicines that will win over doctors, patients and insurers.\par \par \uc2 "We're not talking about replacing biologists," NuMedii Chief Executive Gini Deshpande said. "We're talking about [empowering] biologists to have more data to make these judgment calls."\par \par \uc2 Write to Brian Gormley at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:brian.gormley@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 brian.gormley@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160711ec7b004bs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Imagine a place where driverless cars roam the streets, intelligent electricity grids regulate the power and everything is built from the ground up to the specifications of the ideal "smart" city.\par \par \uc2 This idealised place has been getting a lot of attention in Silicon Valley of late. \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , the region's best-known tech incubator, is the latest to dream, announcing a research project aimed at stimulating ideas and designs that it hopes to use in a real-world location.\par \par \uc2 It is far from alone. From Google co-founder \uc2 Larry Page\uc2  to libertarian venture capitalist \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  , ideas like this have had plenty of currency. \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  says it wants to to speed up the adoption of technologies for ordinary people, not just build "crazy libertarian utopias for techies".\par \par \uc2 This hankering is prompted by more than a passing bout of California dreaming. It reflects a deeper issue that the tech industry faces as it moves into a new phase - and one that will have real-world implications for investors.\par \par \uc2 Companies like \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  - where Mr Thiel was the first outside investor - made their fortunes at a time when the digital and physical worlds were largely separate. But technologies like robotics and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  are breaking down that barrier, pushing algorithms deeper into the functioning of the everyday world.\par \par \uc2 Hence the dream of an idealised place that is both open to - and safe for - experimentation. But it is little help to present-day tech companies, which will have to make their products function in today's world.\par \par \uc2 Last week's news of a fatal accident involving \uc2 Tesla Motors\uc2 ' autonomous driving technology is a case in point. The first death of a person at the wheel of a car that was operating under its own control raises difficult ethical and regulatory issues.\par \par \uc2 From the purely rationalistic position taken by Tesla boss \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  , one death after the 130m miles of autonomous driving his vehicles have clocked up is better than the average fatality rate on US roads. Even before this, "the better-than-human threshold had been crossed", Tesla declared in a defensive blog post on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, if it is found that the technology resulted in a death that an attentive driver would readily have avoided, it would be a setback. It also would raise the question of whether the messy human world, where streets were not designed for robots and other drivers make mistakes, can ever be made safe for driverless vehicles.\par \par \uc2 This puts US regulators in an unenviable position as they consider how to respond. And what goes for cars may one day go for many other everyday situations, as algorithms are embedded in more objects.\par \par \uc2 With its threat of punitive damages through the court system, the US can be a risky place for product experimentation. Mr Musk said on Wednesday that the crash had not yet led to any product liability suits. But regulators may still be cautious. Driverless-cars development is already threatened by fragmented state-level regulation, and the Tesla crash certainly won't help.\par \par \uc2 The danger for tech is that it ends up like the pharmaceuticals industry, which has complained for years about a supposedly risk-averse regulatory system that adds huge costs and delays to new drugs that might offer benefits. Yet drug development has not been driven offshore, despite repeated warnings. The US is still the world's richest drugs market, so it makes sense to persevere.\par \par \uc2 The same might not be true of technologies like driverless cars and drones. China is racing to capitalise on the technology and Baidu - whose expertise in \b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  stems partly from Silicon Valley - has a goal of getting to mass production in five years.\par \par \uc2 There are at least two things Silicon Valley could do to help itself. One is to pay more attention to designing the new interactions between humans and "intelligent" machines. Tesla warns its drivers to keep their hands on the wheel at all times, but it also brags that its technology is better than a human driver - the kind of mixed message that makes it harder for the humans still in the loop to know exactly when and how they may be called on to override the technology.\par \par \uc2 The second is to do more to educate users about both the benefits and the risks of robotics and AI. That would help to ensure an appropriate response to the shortcomings of the technology - especially when, inevitably, a human dies due to the acts or omissions of a robot.\par \par \uc2 richard.waters@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160708ec7800029\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

Venkat and Jake Maxwell Watts   \par \uc2 538 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)\par \uc2 AWSJ\par B5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SINGAPORE -- Singapore state investment firm \uc2 Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd\uc2 . said the value of its portfolio registered an annual drop for the first time since the global financial crisis, largely due to falls in the share prices of its holdings in financial and resources companies.\par \par \uc2 Temasek\uc2  said its total assets declined to 242 billion Singapore dollars (US$179 billion) in the year ended March 31, from S$266 billion a year earlier, the first such decline in seven years. Its net profit fell 43% to S$8 billion.\par \par \uc2 The fund, which holds large stakes in banks such as \uc2 Standard Chartered PLC\uc2  and \uc2 China Construction Bank Corp\uc2 ., as well as major local companies such as \uc2 Singapore Airlines Ltd\uc2 ., warned that the current financial year, which ends in March 2017, could prove challenging, too.\par \par \uc2 "Equity markets around the world will remain susceptible to bouts of volatility in the short to medium term," said Michael Buchanan, \uc2 Temasek\uc2 's head of strategy. He said the increased uncertainty reflected an "ongoing hangover" from the financial crisis eight years ago and lower returns should be expected in the coming years.\par \par \uc2 Temasek\uc2 's results show how state investment funds, which rank among the world's largest investors, are struggling to generate strong returns with interest rates near zero -- and sometimes in negative territory -- in major developed countries, and with economic growth moderating in key emerging markets like China. Around 70% of \uc2 Temasek\uc2 's funds are invested in Asia, with the rest spread roughly evenly between North America, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand.\par \par \uc2 Norway's nearly $900 billion sovereign-wealth fund, the largest of its kind globally, recorded its weakest performance since 2011 last year, which it blamed partly on slowing growth in emerging markets.\par \par \uc2 Banks, which have been struggling with narrowing interest margins, were among the hardest-hit of \uc2 Temasek\uc2 's investments. The value of its 16% stake in \uc2 Standard Chartered\uc2 , a lender heavily exposed to emerging markets and commodity companies, plunged 43%, while the value of its holding in Singapore bank \uc2 DBS Group Holdings Ltd\uc2 . fell 24%.\par \par \uc2 The firm also suffered a decline in value on some its holdings in resources companies, particularly those in the oil industry. Its 49% stake in Singapore-based \uc2 SembCorp Industries Ltd\uc2 ., one of the world's largest rig builders, dropped by 28% in value.\par \par \uc2 In an attempt to improve returns and find companies with better growth prospects, \uc2 Temasek\uc2  has little by little been shifting more into the technology sector, and says it is looking at making investments in newer industries such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and life sciences.\par \par \uc2 At the end of March, 25% of its portfolio was in telecommunications, media and technology companies, up from 24% a year earlier, while its weighting toward financial services fell to 23% from 28%.\par \par \uc2 Among major new investments in 2015, \uc2 Temasek\uc2  took an undisclosed stake in Beijing-based ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and \uc2 Airbnb Inc\uc2 ., a U.S.-based home-sharing website. Big divestments included the sale of its stakes in U.K. bank \uc2 Lloyds Banking Group PLC\uc2  and Singapore semiconductor firm \uc2 STATS ChipPAC Ltd\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20160707000086"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020160721ec7800008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With fully autonomous vehicles expected to hit the road by 2020, automobile manufacturers and ride-hailing rivals have become unlikely allies.\par \par \uc2 The common bond is a vision of a driverless ride-hailing future, in which margins rise for ride-hailing companies and automotive companies avoid destruction as consumer sales drop.\par \par \uc2 "They're being driven together by common risk," said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.\par \par \uc2 These partnerships are up against well-known technology companies with more in-house \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  knowledge and data, but some think the winner will come down to whomever has the biggest consumer brand.\par \par \uc2 By the year 2030, global car sales are "basically going to fall off a cliff," said Tasha Keeney, an industrial innovation analyst at \uc2 ARK Investment Management\uc2 . Meanwhile, \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Lyft Inc\uc2 . are in the midst of class-action lawsuits with drivers who argue they are employees, not independent contractors, which would force the companies to pay for benefits.\par \par \uc2 That means pairing up could save both money, said Paul Boyd, managing partner of ClearPath Capital Partners. A driverless infrastructure could be of particular interest to Uber as it seeks greater profitability.\par \par \uc2 "If they can eliminate that, then their margins go way up," Mr. Boyd said\par \par \uc2 At the center of the autonomous future, Lyft, Volvo, Uber, \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Ford Motor Co\uc2 . are all part of a self-driving coalition, formed in April, and will collectively lobby law makers around autonomous infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Outside of that group, individual companies have siphoned off into a complicated web of pairings and investments. \uc2 Lyft Inc\uc2 . began the trend in January with a $500 million investment from \uc2 General Motors\uc2 , which also invested in ride-hailing companies Sidecar and Cruise, with the stated goal of forming an "autonomous on-demand network."\par \par \uc2 Uber followed that with a recent partnership with and investment from Toyota to create "in-car apps," but it also counts \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 ., a partner with Volvo, as an investor.\par \par \uc2 Ride-hailing companies and manufacturers are "both afraid of the big boys of tech showing up," Mr. Wolff said.\par \par \uc2 The "big boys" include Alphabet's \uc2 Google\uc2 , which Ms. Keeney theorizes has the most advanced system in terms of self-driving capability, given the detailed data it is collecting using Lidar, a technology that measures distance using pulses of light. Data collection is a key component in the development of driverless cars, she said.\par \par \uc2 With semiautonomous vehicles already on the market, \uc2 Tesla Motors Inc\uc2 . is collecting a large data set from its customers and has advanced technology that allows wireless software updates. This makes Tesla, one of the more siloed members of the group, one of the front-runners, Ms. Keeney said.\par \par \uc2 Tesla's position may be more uncertain after a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/failure-of-teslas-autopilot-is-warning-sign-for-tech-1467891000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 fatal crash}}}\uc2  in which the owner had autopilot engaged and a resulting federal investigation of its "Autopilot" feature, however.\par \par \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . lags behind both \uc2 Google\uc2  and Tesla in terms of test cars, she said, and will have to develop more \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  talent. "I think they're pretty behind," Ms. Keeney said.\par \par \uc2 Still, based on the idea that autonomous-driving infrastructure is made up of three parts\u8212\'20\'14the actual cars, the technology and the consumer brand\u8212\'20\'14several companies could have the fleets and the technology needed, said \uc2 Scott Stanford\uc2 , managing director at Sherpa Ventures. That is when ride-hailing brands like Uber and Lyft, as well as \uc2 Google\uc2 , come back into play.\par \par \uc2 "I think the competitive advantage lies in the consumer brand," Mr. Stanford said.\par \par \uc2 In a sense, Apple has the Lyft consumer brand as well through its $1 billion investment in \uc2 Didi Chuxing\uc2 . Didi is part of an international coalition involving Lyft and has invested in the startup.\par \par \uc2 Apple's link to Lyft through its investment in Didi is just one example of how complicated this web of partnerships has become. It likely will get even more complicated as the age of driverless ride-hailing approaches.\par \par \uc2 "I think there will be more partnerships coming," Mr. Boyd said.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160708ec780070t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 From the moment Britain voted to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2 , financiers across the continent began disagreeing on what it meant for London's banks. But one German was unequivocal about the consequences for a smaller but growing area of financial services: "London has committed suicide as a leading fintech centre," tweeted Jochen Siegert , chief operating officer of Traxpay, a Frankfurt-based payments platform.\par \par \uc2 Germany's digital entrepreneurs are not only convinced that London is finished, but also believe they are poised to wrest its crown as Europe's centre of fintech. This confidence is particularly strong in Berlin, the cradle of Germany's tech industry.\par \par \uc2 Cornelia Yzer\uc2 , Berlin's economics minister, says her department has received "dozens of emails" in the past week from companies based in London considering a relocation to the German capital.\par \par \uc2 "Berlin will exploit the opportunity provided by Brexit," she says. "These companies need to be in the heart of Europe and where is better than the capital of Europe's strongest economy?"\par \par \uc2 For financial technology - or fintech - groups, the motivation is simple: if, in post-Brexit negotiations, the UK loses access to the European single market, London shrinks as a global banking centre and investment in their start-ups will stop.\par \par \uc2 Among the companies dusting off their Berlin Rough Guides are \uc2 TransferWise\uc2 , a London-based money transfer company that has raised $117m from backers that include Virgin's Richard Branson , and Revolut, a global payments app that has attracted $4.8m from venture capitalists.\par \par \uc2 TransferWise\uc2 , which has 100 of its 600 staff in London, and Revolut, with 40 staff, are both considering the option of moving to Berlin, according to people familiar with the companies' plans.\par \par \uc2 Revolut's chief executive, Nikolay Storonsky , openly accepts that the company may need to open and license a subsidiary on the continent if it wants access to the \uc2 EU\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The transfer side of our business relies on the single market, specifically directives such as Sepa [the single European payments area]," he acknowledges.\par \par \uc2 TransferWise\uc2  cofounder Taavet Hinrikus tweeted on Sunday that "Ireland, Switzerland, others" had been "reaching out and tempting \uc2 TransferWise\uc2  to start/move operations there", adding "Competition between states is good."\par \par \uc2 TransferWise\uc2  and Revolut are not alone. Berlin Partner - an agency that promotes investment in the city - says the day after the UK referendum it was contacted by five London-based fintech start-ups.\par \par \uc2 "They said their investors are forcing them to consider relocating," says Stefan Franzke, the agency's head. "Capital must go where the returns are higher."\par \par \uc2 Berlin has long been in the vanguard of the fintech revolution. It has become home to dozens of small, nimble German companies trying to disrupt the business models of the established banks, through innovations such as peer-to-peer lending, crowd investing and online marketplaces.\par \par \uc2 Famously described by a former mayor as "poor but sexy", Berlin has proved a big draw for web entrepreneurs the world over, with its cheap rents, vibrant nightlife and cosmopolitan vibe. Even before the Brexit vote, it was positioning itself as a rival to London's Silicon Roundabout.\par \par \uc2 A recent survey by EY suggests it is succeeding, and names Berlin as Europe's start-up capital: the city's tech companies received \u8364\'20\'AC2.15bn in venture capital funding last year, more than the \u8364\'20\'AC1.77bn attracted by London.\par \par \uc2 Overall, \u8364\'20\'AC3.1bn in investment flowed into German start-ups in 2015 - nearly double the total for 2014 - and one-fifth of this went into fintech.\par \par \uc2 But the sector remains relatively small. Of a total of 12,000 fintechs in the world, only 300 are in Germany, according to PwC's management consultancy Strategy &. Only one German fintech financing round topped $50m in 2015 - the \u8364\'20\'AC82.5m raised by online lender Kreditech. In the US, 38 managed this.\par \par \uc2 "Historically, Berlin's main advantage has been cost, but that's not enough," says Brent Hoberman, founder of \uc2 lastminute.com\uc2  and head of Founders Factory. "Also, Berlin doesn't have the big corporates that London, Frankfurt and Paris have." In addition, start-ups in the German capital "tend to be less innovative and more risk-averse than those in London", he claims.\par \par \uc2 Up until now, London has led the way in fintech - thanks to its challenger banks and a vast array of blockchain, \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data-mining companies.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, the British fintech sector generated \u163\'00\'A36.6bn in revenues and attracted \u163\'00\'A3524m in investment, according to EY - figures that Berlin can only dream of.\par \par \uc2 German fintech revenues were only \u163\'00\'A31.8bn split between Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich, with \u163\'00\'A3388m invested.\par \par \uc2 However, one of the main reasons London has thrived is its proximity to the large global banks, which use the UK as a gateway to "passport" their goods and services to Europe's single market of 500m customers. Many now doubt the banks will be able to retain their European passport if Britain leaves the \uc2 EU\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Why would you want to stay in the UK when it's so insecure?" says Ramin Niroumand, co-founder of FinLeap, a Berlin-based fintech company builder. "It doesn't have the euro, so there's a currency issue, and now you have this passporting problem."\par \par \uc2 Revolut's plan for a subsidiary is one way to get round it.\par \par \uc2 With a post-Brexit Britain likely to seek curbs on immigration, foreign IT staff might also find it easier to work in Berlin than London.\par \par \uc2 "If you have constraints on attracting international talent, you will lose out against cities like Berlin," notes Marc Bernegger, a Swiss-based fintech investor.\par \par \uc2 Berlin Partner, for example, prides itself on fixing foreign techies up with work and residence permits within five working days - regardless of where they come from.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, Berlin's digital entrepreneurs are careful not to express any schadenfreude over Britain's shock vote to leave. "Personally, we benefit from Brexit, but is it really good for us?" asks Mr Niroumand. "It just fragments the market."\par \par \uc2 However, any sense of regret has not stopped Berlin sharpening its sales pitch. Ms Yzer says city envoys will not only target tech start-ups based in Britain, but also international companies with their European headquarters in London.\par \par \uc2 "We will win them for Berlin," she says, with Teutonic confidence. And the rallying cry, she says, is "You Need To Be In!".\par \par \uc2 Some think the authorities should go further. Digital lobbying group cnetz has suggested the \uc2 German government\uc2  help cover relocating start-ups' moving costs.\par \par \uc2 Ms Yzer says there are enough incentives already. "We offer reliability and the security companies' need for long-term planning," she says. "We are in the heart of the \uc2 EU\uc2  and we will stay there."\par \par \uc2 Digital defiance\par \par \uc2 City vows to maintain lead role\par \par \uc2 While Germany's digital entrepreneurs claim London will lose its reputation as a global centre for financial technology with Britain leaving the \uc2 EU\uc2 , many leaders of the UK tech scene insist the capital is not giving up its crown to Berlin anytime soon.\par \par \uc2 "The London fintech ecosystem is leaps ahead of Berlin," said Gerard Grech, chief executive of Tech City UK, the government-backed body that promotes the country's tech sector.\par \par \uc2 "With 350,000 people working in financial services and over 320,000 in digital technologies, we have a critical mass of expertise, alongside deep capital and a continued creation of new initiatives to support our entrepreneurs," Mr Grech added.\par \par \uc2 "From the financial services regulator's sandbox for trailing emergent business models to the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 's recent announcement of a FinTech Accelerator, London is and will continue to be a financial tech powerhouse." In 2015, British fintech made \u163\'00\'A36.6bn in revenues and attracted roughly \u163\'00\'A3524m in investment, according to EY.\par \par \uc2 Eileen Burbidge, a partner at London-based venture capital firm Passion Capital, says: "The best founders and entrepreneurs build successful companies no matter the macroeconomic or political climate, and therefore the best of the UK will continue to succeed even in a Brexitconsumed world."

He had been with the technology group for 10 years. Before that he spent nearly 20 years at \uc2 Walmart\uc2  where he served as chief information officer and later chief executive of Sam\u8217\'20\'19s Club.\par \par \uc2 The appointment of Mr Turner comes as \uc2 Citadel Securities\uc2  is building up market positions in equities and fixed income markets once occupied by banks.\par \par \uc2 Many banks, hit by more stringent regulatory capital rules, have been focusing a narrower set of business lines. In their place, non-bank market makers have emerged, using computers to automatically price trades at lightning speed. Chicago-based Citadel has become the largest of a new breed of share traders.\par \par \uc2 It now executes trades of more than a billion shares every day in the US, as well as a fifth of the country\u8217\'20\'19s options transactions. It is also one of the largest traders of interest rate swaps in the US.\par \par \uc2 Mr Turner will head a team that includes \uc2 Jamil Nazarali\uc2 , head of Citadel Execution Services, and Paul Hamill, global head of fixed, income, currencies and commodities for \uc2 Citadel Securities\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He is taking over the role held by Peng Zhao, who will become chief scientist at Citadel, overseeing the group\u8217\'20\'19s development of quantitative trading and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Mr Zhao will also become a vice-chair.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CKevin is a world-class business builder with experience managing large and complex organisations. He will be an outstanding leader for \uc2 Citadel Securities\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ken Griffin, Citadel\u8217\'20\'19s founder and chief executive .\par \par \uc2 As part of its expansion plan the company in May bought assets of \uc2 Automated Trading Desk\uc2 , a computer-based market making pioneer owned by \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 . Earlier this year it purchased the designated market-maker business of \uc2 KCG Holdings\uc2 , the high-frequency trader, at the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160707ec77007sl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SINGAPORE -- \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . is locked in major tussles with local rivals in China and India, but a homegrown upstart is also grabbing an advantage in the race for another Asia prize.\par \par \uc2 A startup called Grab is winning ride-hailing turf in Southeast Asia -- home to 600 million people, almost double the population of the U.S. The startup serves more cities in the region than Uber and, according to mobile-app \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 App Annie\uc2 , is beating the world's most valuable startup in the race for users here.\par \par \uc2 The region's ride-hailing market is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion last year, according to a recent report on Southeast Asia's internet economy conducted by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and Singapore state-investment firm \uc2 Temasek Holdings\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Singapore-based \uc2 GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd\uc2 ., as it is formally known, launched in 2012 and offers locally tailored services such as motorcycle taxis -- a popular method for negotiating the region's traffic-clogged cities -- package deliveries and cash payment.\par \par \uc2 It also has a pilot carpooling service allowing people living in southern Malaysia, where living costs are lower than in neighboring Singapore, to share rides into the city-state.\par \par \uc2 In four years, the company, valued at $1.6 billion in its most recent funding round last year, has expanded to 1,600 employees. It operates in 30 Southeast Asian cities -- twice as many as Uber -- in six countries.\par \par \uc2 Even so, Grab faces a tough fight against Uber, a global powerhouse valued at close to $68 billion. It has raised $14 billion in debt and equity, providing it with a massive war chest for global expansion -- and local turf wars.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said Uber is "part of everyday life for millions across Southeast Asia," where the company is "led by local teams."\par \par \uc2 Grab has some significant investors in its corner. In addition to U.S. hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and \uc2 Tiger Global Management\uc2 , it has received funding from Uber's biggest competitor in China: \uc2 Didi Chuxing Technology Co\uc2 ., the country's largest ride-sharing company.\par \par \uc2 Grab also has joined Didi, ANI Technologies Pvt.'s Ola in India and San Francisco startup \uc2 Lyft Inc\uc2 . in a global alliance of Uber rivals. They work together to allow users of each company's app to hail rides from the other apps' drivers in other countries.\par \par \uc2 Grab's co-founder, \uc2 Anthony Tan\uc2 , a 34-year-old Malaysian who dreamed up the venture with a classmate at \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 , said he envisions the company as a sprawling, web-based platform, leveraging its location data to offer services beyond rides, such as digital payments.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think only about transport," said Mr. Tan, also Grab's chief executive, in an interview at the company's Singapore headquarters, a modest space in an office park where new taxi drivers come to sign up. "How do we build a Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent?" he said, referring to China's three leading internet companies, which dominate that country's search, e-commerce and social-media markets.\par \par \uc2 Florian Hoppe, a consultant at \uc2 Bain & Company\uc2 , said "it's hard for [Uber] to tailor to unique local requirements" in the region, while Singapore-based Grab understands what Southeast Asian consumers need. He pointed to Grab's service connecting commuters in Malaysia to Singapore as an example.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Resty Woro Yuniar contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160706000084"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161004ec760000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Natural gas prices inched up Wednesday, rebounding from losses just after prices dipped to a one-week low.\par \par \uc2 Natural gas for August delivery settled up 2.2 cents, or 0.8%, at $2.786 a million British thermal units on the \uc2 New York Mercantile Exchange\uc2 . It rebounded from{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/natural-gas-slides-on-production-demand-concerns-1467732140"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  losses of 7.5% on Tuesday}}}\uc2 , which had been the biggest one-day decline since October.\par \par \uc2 That made gas relatively cheap for this time of year, said John Woods, president of JJ Woods Associates and a Nymex trader. Demand often rises in the summer to fuel power plants as people turn up their air conditioners during hot weather. And forecasts for the rest of the summer still show above-normal temperatures.\par \par \uc2 "We're gonna go right back up again," Mr. Woods said by text. "At these levels I'm a big-time buyer."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Woods and some analysts do, however, think the rally has limited potential, maybe capped at around $3/mmBtu. Power generators have been burning more coal in recent weeks as gas prices moved higher. They consumed more natural gas, too, but largely because of unexpected declines in output from nuclear, wind and hydropower units, which analysts had warned might be temporary.\par \par \uc2 Natural-gas demand started July down 7% from the last week of June at 61.6 billion cubic feet a day, according to Platts \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a forecasting and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  unit of S&P Global Platts. Weather has cooled about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit in that time, hurting demand for gas-fired electric power to run air conditioners, which fell 12% from the last week of June, Platts said.\par \par \uc2 "The bulls are spooked currently, as the first indications of July demand\u8230\'20\'26were pretty poor," said Scott Shelton, broker at ICAP PLC.\par \par \uc2 Write to Timothy Puko at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:tim.puko@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tim.puko@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160706ec760063i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc18}{\*\bkmkend toc18}\b \uc2 WSJ.D Technology: Grab, Uber Tussle Over Turf --- Ride-hailing service serves 30 cities in Southeast Asia -- twice as many as Uber\b0\par\par\uc2 By Newley Purnell   \par \uc2 713 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)\par \uc2 WSJE\par B3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved   \par \par \uc2 SINGAPORE -- \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . is locked in major tussles with local rivals in China and India, but a homegrown upstart is also grabbing an advantage in the race for another Asia prize.\par \par \uc2 A startup called Grab is winning ride-hailing turf in Southeast Asia -- home to 600 million people, almost double the population of the U.S. The startup serves more cities in the region than Uber and, according to mobile-app \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 App Annie\uc2 , is beating the world's most valuable startup in the race for users here.\par \par \uc2 The region's ride-hailing market is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion last year, according to a recent report on Southeast Asia's internet economy conducted by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and Singapore state-investment firm \uc2 Temasek Holdings\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Singapore-based \uc2 GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd\uc2 ., as it is formally known, launched in 2012 and offers locally tailored services such as motorcycle taxis -- a popular method for negotiating the region's traffic-clogged cities -- package deliveries and cash payment. It also has a pilot carpooling service allowing people living in southern Malaysia, where living costs are lower than in neighboring Singapore, to share rides into the city-state.\par \par \uc2 In four years, the company, valued at $1.6 billion in its most recent funding round last year, has expanded to 1,600 employees. It operates in 30 Southeast Asian cities -- twice as many as Uber -- in six countries.\par \par \uc2 Even so, Grab faces a tough fight against Uber, a global powerhouse valued at close to $68 billion. It has raised $14 billion in debt and equity, providing it with a massive war chest for global expansion -- and local turf wars.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said Uber is "part of everyday life for millions across Southeast Asia," where the company is "led by local teams."\par \par \uc2 Grab has some significant investors in its corner. In addition to U.S. hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and \uc2 Tiger Global Management\uc2 , it has received funding from Uber's biggest competitor in China: \uc2 Didi Chuxing Technology Co\uc2 ., the country's largest ride-sharing company.\par \par \uc2 Grab has also joined Didi, ANI Technologies Pvt.'s Ola in India and San Francisco startup \uc2 Lyft Inc\uc2 . in a global alliance of Uber rivals. They work together to allow users of each company's app to hail rides from the other apps' drivers in other countries.\par \par \uc2 Grab's co-founder, \uc2 Anthony Tan\uc2 , a 34-year-old Malaysian who dreamed up the venture with a classmate at \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 , said he envisions the company as a sprawling, web-based platform, leveraging its location data to offer services beyond rides, such as digital payments.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think only about transport," said Mr. Tan, also Grab's chief executive, in an interview at the company's Singapore headquarters, a modest space in an office park where new taxi drivers come to sign up.

The company is profitable in some cities in which it operates, he said, though he declined to forecast when the company will turn a profit overall.\par \par \uc2 In a region where few people have credit cards and many lack bank accounts, Grab first offered cash payments for users and drivers alike.

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 SINGAPORE -- \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . is locked in major tussles with local rivals in China and India, but a homegrown upstart is also grabbing an advantage in the race for another Asia prize.\par \par \uc2 A startup called Grab is winning ride-hailing turf in Southeast Asia -- home to 600 million people, almost double the population of the U.S. The startup serves more cities in the region than Uber and, according to mobile-app \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 App Annie\uc2 , is beating the world's most valuable startup in the race for users here.\par \par \uc2 The region's ride-hailing market is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion last year, according to a recent report on Southeast Asia's internet economy conducted by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and Singapore state-investment firm \uc2 Temasek Holdings\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Singapore-based \uc2 GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd\uc2 ., as it is formally known, launched in 2012 and offers locally tailored services such as motorcycle taxis -- a popular method for negotiating the region's traffic-clogged cities -- package deliveries and cash payment. It also has a pilot carpooling service allowing people living in southern Malaysia, where living costs are lower than in neighboring Singapore, to share rides into the city-state.\par \par \uc2 In four years, the company, valued at $1.6 billion in its most recent funding round last year, has expanded to 1,600 employees. It operates in 30 Southeast Asian cities -- twice as many as Uber -- in six countries.\par \par \uc2 Even so, Grab faces a tough fight against Uber, a global powerhouse valued at close to $68 billion. It has raised $14 billion in debt and equity, providing it with a massive war chest for global expansion -- and local turf wars.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said Uber is "part of everyday life for millions across Southeast Asia," where the company is "led by local teams."\par \par \uc2 Grab has some significant investors in its corner. In addition to U.S. hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and \uc2 Tiger Global Management\uc2 , it has received funding from Uber's biggest competitor in China: \uc2 Didi Chuxing Technology Co\uc2 ., the country's largest ride-sharing company.\par \par \uc2 Grab has also joined Didi, ANI Technologies Pvt.'s Ola in India and San Francisco startup \uc2 Lyft Inc\uc2 . in a global alliance of Uber rivals. They work together to allow users of each company's app to hail rides from the other apps' drivers in other countries.\par \par \uc2 Grab's co-founder, \uc2 Anthony Tan\uc2 , a 34-year-old Malaysian who dreamed up the venture with a classmate at \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 , said he envisions the company as a sprawling, web-based platform, leveraging its location data to offer services beyond rides, such as digital payments.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think only about transport," said Mr. Tan, also Grab's chief executive, in an interview at the company's Singapore headquarters, a modest space in an office park where new taxi drivers come to sign up. "How do we build a Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent?" he said, referring to China's three leading internet companies, which dominate that country's search, e-commerce and social-media markets.\par \par \uc2 Grab has banked close to two-thirds of the almost $700 million it has raised from investors and isn't in need of additional funds at the moment, Mr. Tan said. The company is profitable in some cities in which it operates, he said, though he declined to forecast when the company will turn a profit overall.\par \par \uc2 In a region where few people have credit cards and many lack bank accounts, Grab first offered cash payments for users and drivers alike. It recently added motorbike taxis in cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta so commuters use can weave through traffic gridlock. Uber has since followed.\par \par \uc2 Grab also offers a package-delivery service designed to assist the region's e-commerce startups, which sometimes struggle to get items to customers in places that lack traditional addresses or where roads are poor.\par \par \uc2 Uber has a delivery service, but it isn't available outside the U.S.\par \par \uc2 In Indonesia, Grab has worked to augment third-party maps by adding points of interest for pickups and drop-offs at locations not otherwise covered, like warungs -- roadside stalls where people often congregate to buy goods or socialize.\par \par \uc2 Uber's innovations include the UberEats on-demand food-delivery service, which gained its first Asian location in May with a launch in Singapore. The company's carpool service, UberPool, was expanded from Jakarta and Manila to Singapore last week.\par \par \uc2 Uber's huge cash pile means it can afford to hire top engineering talent and develop cutting-edge technologies. It could also allow it to spend money for longer than the less-deep-pocketed Grab, analysts say, potentially wearing it down over the long haul.\par \par \uc2 Then there is a technological barrier both companies face: While Southeast Asia's population is large, many consumers still lack web access, meaning they can't use the apps.\par \par \uc2 Neither Grab nor Uber discloses user numbers, but Grab's app topped Uber's in first-quarter downloads for both Android and Apple devices in every market in which Grab operates: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, according to \uc2 App Annie\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Grab also leads Uber in monthly active users in "a number of Southeast Asian markets" on Android smartphones, which dominate the region, \uc2 App Annie\uc2  estimates. The company doesn't give out numbers.\par \par \uc2 Grab says its app has been downloaded more than 15 million times. An Uber spokesman declined to comment on \uc2 App Annie\uc2 's data, or disclose any user or download data for Southeast Asia.\par \par \uc2 Florian Hoppe, a consultant at \uc2 Bain & Company\uc2 , said "it's hard for [Uber] to tailor to unique local requirements" in the region, while Singapore-based Grab understands what Southeast Asian consumers need. He pointed to Grab's service connecting commuters in Malaysia to Singapore as an example.\par \par \uc2 "That's the gap" Grab has taken advantage of, he said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Resty Woro Yuniar contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20160704000061"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020160923ec7400005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Pro Private Markets\par {\*\bkmkstart toc21}{\*\bkmkend toc21}\b \uc2 PE Firms Fill Their Shopping Baskets With Public Tech Companies\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Cooper \par \uc2 721 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par 15:31\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Private equity firms are once again shopping in the public markets for deals\u8212\'20\'14and many are finding them in the software aisle.\par \par \uc2 A combination of volatile share-price performance among publicly-traded technology companies, pressure from activist investors and private-equity firms flush with capital has helped drive one of the busiest quarters in recent memory for take-private deals in the technology sector. For some of these companies, private equity can help companies regroup away from the public eye, particularly for those software companies that have seen their growth rates slow.\par \par \uc2 "When high-growth companies go through deceleration, they're often overpunished by the public markets," said Mark Holman, a partner in the communications, media and technology group at management consulting firm \uc2 A.T. Kearney\uc2 . "Sometimes it's easier to get refooted in the private market."\par \par \uc2 According to data provider Dealogic Ltd., financial sponsor-backed acquisitions of public companies in the technology industry hit $11.24 billion across six deals during the second quarter through June 13, the highest quarter by deal numbers since at least 2010 and the highest level by dollar volume since the first quarter of 2013. So far this year in the U.S., financial sponsors have announced eight take-private deals in the technology space, totaling about $12.17 billion, more than 71% of the $17.01 billion in deal value represented by all private equity-backed public-to-private deals so far this year, according to Dealogic's data.\par \par \uc2 If the pace continues, take-private deals in the tech space could handily match, or even surpass, the $21.57 billion such deals accounted for last year. Demand for public tech companies matches record mergers and acquisitions in the global tech sector overall, with total merger-and-acquisition volume of technology deals hitting $286 billion during the first half of the year through June 22, according to Dealogic, the second highest first half the sector has projected on record.\par \par \uc2 High purchase-price multiples for tech companies in the private markets has made public companies more attractive, particularly given public stock volatility. The Nasdaq Composite Index suffered in the first quarter, dropping to 4,266 on Feb. 11 from more than 5,000 for much of November and December of 2015, although it has since recovered to 4,910 on June 23.\par \par \uc2 "If you look at the stock market performance year to date, I think it certainly created an opportunity to take advantage of what's going on," said Tim Millikin, a principal at TPG who focuses on the technology, media and telecommunications space. "Software and SaaS performance in the first quarter was quite volatile."\par \par \uc2 Early in the year, for example, \uc2 Insight Venture Partners\uc2  snapped up document-sharing software provider \uc2 Diligent Corp\uc2 . for about $624 million or $4.90 a share, a roughly 31% premium to the company's share price just before the deal was announced.\par \par \uc2 Pressure on tech companies from activist investors also has helped push more of them into play with well-capitalized private-equity firms reaping the benefits. Data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  software provider \uc2 Qlik Technologies Inc\uc2 . had been under pressure to sell from activist investor \uc2 Elliott Management Corp\uc2 . before ultimately succumbing earlier this month, resulting in an agreement to sell to \uc2 Thoma Bravo LLC\uc2  for nearly $3 billion. Elliott also played a role in driving sales of companies that include \uc2 Riverbed Technology Inc\uc2 ., which \uc2 Thoma Bravo\uc2  acquired in late 2014, and \uc2 Informatica Corp\uc2 ., which sold to Permira Advisors LLP and the \uc2 Canada Pension Plan Investment Board\uc2  last year.\par \par \uc2 Private-equity firms are well capitalized to pick up these companies, thanks to several years of strong fundraising. If stock prices continue to strengthen into the latter part of the year, however, firms may have to pay more to win over shareholders and management. At the same time, a May ruling by a Delaware judge that Silver Lake's 2013 buyout of \uc2 Dell Inc\uc2 . shortchanged shareholders by more than $6 billion may encourage more public shareholders to push for higher pricing in the midst of a potential sale process, although industry experts don't expect it to have a severe impact on future deal flow.\par \par \uc2 (Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly spelled Mr. Millikin's last name.)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160705ec75005pp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Regulars of San Francisco's South Park, the neighborhood where many venture-capital firms have set up West Coast outposts, often think they have spotted Redpoint Ventures Partner \uc2 Tomasz Tunguz\uc2  working late in the office.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Tunguz always aims to be home for dinner with his family at 5:30 p.m. sharp. Passersby have been fooled by a cardboard cutout of him made for a technology conference that his co-workers place around the office to trick people.\par \par \uc2 It's understandable Mr. Tunguz could be perceived as being in two places at once. His experience as a Dartmouth College-educated engineer and his obsession with \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  have led to a pace of six potentially promising investments at Redpoint.\par \par \uc2 Within Silicon Valley, the 34-year-old venture capitalist also has built a following as a writer. He has a popular VC blog and recently released his book, Winning With Data.\par \par \uc2 Tomasz Tunguz\par \par \uc2 Education\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tunguz earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, a bachelor's of engineering in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and a master's in engineering management from \uc2 Dartmouth College\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Career Path\par \par \uc2 After college, Mr. Tunguz worked as an engineer at \uc2 Appian Corp\uc2 ., developing systems for the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 . He then moved to \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 ., where he managed the company's AdSense product for social networks. He joined \uc2 Redpoint Ventures\uc2  in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Board Positions\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tunguz sits on the boards of Axial Networks Inc., Electric Imp Inc., \uc2 Expensify Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Looker Data Sciences Inc\uc2 . and Dremio Corp. He's also a board observer at Quantifind Inc. and ThredUP Inc.\par \par \uc2 Every weekday at 5 a.m., Mr. Tunguz writes a data-driven blog post about startups. Many of his posts focus on cloud-based software companies or play off recent news, like \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 .'s acquisition of \uc2 LinkedIn Corp\uc2 . Popular blog posts include "A Framework for Maximizing Startup Marketing Effectiveness" and a series called "Startup Best Practices."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tunguz said the idea to start a blog came from attending board meetings. Entrepreneurs would ask questions about hiring or about what benchmarks they needed to hit before raising another funding round. He felt he needed to make that information available to more startups.\par \par \uc2 "As investors, we see all that data every day," Mr. Tunguz said. "We just haven't as an industry done a great job of aggregating it, collecting it and presenting it to entrepreneurs."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tunguz said the blog has helped him build in-bound interest from entrepreneurs and given him an edge on competitive deals. Redpoint Partner \uc2 Satish Dharmaraj\uc2  said Mr. Tunguz has built such a strong reputation among founders that Mr. Dharmaraj often finds entrepreneurs want him on their board, even if Mr. Tunguz didn't bring the deal to Redpoint himself.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dharmaraj has been a mentor to Mr. Tunguz and first called his idea for a blog "a yawn." He's been impressed, however, with how Mr. Tunguz has differentiated it from all the other VC blogs.\par \par \uc2 "He sets his mind to something and delivers with a ridiculous amount of hard work," Mr. Dharmaraj said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tunguz joined Redpoint eight years ago as an associate and rose through the ranks to general partner. He came to the firm after working as a product manager at Google Inc., overseeing AdSense for social networks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tunguz's bets include \uc2 Looker Data Sciences Inc\uc2 ., Axial Networks Inc., \uc2 Expensify Inc\uc2 ., Electric Imp Inc., ThredUP Inc. and Dremio Corp. Though they include both enterprise and consumer companies, Mr. Tunguz said the common thread among the companies is data. Looking ahead, he's interested in investing in other applications of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , like language processing.\par \par \uc2 Though he's proven he can edge out the competition on an investment, it remains to be seen if his unique data-driven approach will generate large returns for Redpoint. None of the companies he's invested in have exited yet.\par \par \uc2 Despite lacking a record of successful exits, he's proven he can still win competitive deals.\par \par \uc2 Looker Chief Executive \uc2 Frank Bien\uc2  said when his company was raising its Series A in 2013, the market was "hot" for business intelligence companies like his. He said many large venture-capital firms were interested in leading the round, but the company went with Redpoint because as a data company, they wanted to work with an investor who was so data driven.\par \par \uc2 "Venture capitalists always want to help you, Tom actually can help you," Mr. Bien said. "Tom is a long-view, build-a-business kind of a guy\u8212\'20\'14that's who you want around a table with you."\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160705ec75005pv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Pro Private Markets\par {\*\bkmkstart toc23}{\*\bkmkend toc23}\b \uc2 Venture Capitalists Look to Corporate Acquirers, Private-Equity Firms for Exits\b0\par\par\uc2 By Russ Garland \par \uc2 1,056 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par 15:32\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 .'s acquisition of \uc2 LinkedIn Corp\uc2 . ramped up venture-capitalist expectations that mergers and acquisitions will provide more exits for technology companies in the face of a lethargic market for initial public offerings.\par \par \uc2 Although \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  was publicly traded, the $26.2 billion deal, the largest ever by \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 , reinforced signals that potential buyers of tech companies are on the hunt. The recent decline in the valuations of venture-backed companies could make them more attractive to corporate acquirers and private-equity firms.\par \par \uc2 "For the last three or four years, a lot of the public companies just kind of sat back and watched all the drama play out in the Valley," venture capitalist \uc2 Marc Andreessen\uc2  said during a recent \uc2 Bloomberg LP\uc2  technology conference. "Most of the big tech companies have done very well over the past five years. They've piled up lots of cash, and they have to go shopping."\par \par \uc2 The pace of venture-backed M&A activity in the second quarter approached that of last year. There were 98 transactions that closed in the quarter as of June 16, and the year-to-date total was 237 deals, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by Private Equity Analyst publisher Dow Jones & Co. There were 527 M&A deals in 2015.\par \par \uc2 The disclosed value of deals is on track to beat 2015, with $20.9 billion raised through June 16, compared with $30.14 billion for all of last year. This year's pace so far is well shy of 2014, however, when disclosed deals totaled $63.52 billion.\par \par \uc2 There are plenty of targets for potential buyers. Median time from first venture investment to M&A was 4.6 years in 2015, according to VentureSource. More than 3,500 companies that received their initial venture capital from 2010 to 2012 are private and independent, according to data compiled by VentureSource in May.\par \par \uc2 Private-company pricing remains a concern for buyers, however. Although valuations have come down from last year's peak, many investors think they will fall farther. "I think it's going to take a year to get all these valuations adjusted, if not two," said \uc2 Hans Swildens\uc2 , founder and chief executive of secondary investor Industry Ventures LLC.\par \par \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  went public in 2011 after raising more than $100 million in venture capital. Its stock peaked at $270.76 a share in February 2015 but one year later dropped as low as $100.98 each.\par \par \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  agreed to pay $196 a share in a cash deal that was seen as an effort by the software company to bolster its Office products by linking them to a professional social network that claims 433 million members.\par \par \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  in March acquired \uc2 Xamarin Inc\uc2 ., a five-year-old maker of software development tools. The price wasn't disclosed but a person familiar with the deal told The Wall Street Journal that the company went for between $400 million and $500 million. Venture investors included CRV, Floodgate, Ignition Partners and Insight Venture Partners.\par \par \uc2 Other active corporate acquirers include \uc2 Cisco Systems Inc\uc2 ., which in March paid $1.4 billion for \uc2 Jasper Technologies Inc\uc2 . The company's technology monitors sensors via cellular networks, enabling customers to track assets such as vehicles and industrial equipment, an application of the so-called Internet of Things. Jasper received its first venture capital in 2005 and counted \uc2 Sequoia Capital\uc2  among its investors.\par \par \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . acquired three venture-backed companies so far this year: \uc2 Emotient Inc\uc2 ., Flyby Media Inc. and LearnSprout Inc. Emotient uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology to analyze facial expressions. It raised $8 million from venture investors including \uc2 Intel Capital\uc2 , but the company hadn't been able to secure additional financing at favorable terms, according to someone familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Private-equity firms also are acquiring venture-backed companies. One notable deal was \uc2 Vista Equity Partners\uc2 ' purchase of \uc2 Ping Identity Corp\uc2 . for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.\par \par \uc2 The internet-security company, launched in 2002, was preparing to go public in 2017 when Vista showed up, according to Chief Executive Andre Durand. He said Ping had been approached by potential buyers about a half dozen times and accepted Vista's offer because it enabled Ping to remain a standalone company. Its venture backers included \uc2 Draper Fisher Jurvetson\uc2  and \uc2 General Catalyst Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Around the same time as the Ping announcement, Vista agreed to acquire publicly traded \uc2 Marketo Inc\uc2 ., a marketing technology provider, for about $1.79 billion. Like \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 , \uc2 Marketo\uc2  was a former venture-backed company whose stock price had fallen early this year.\par \par \uc2 Vista also this year bought venture-backed company \uc2 Telarix Inc\uc2 . and late last year purchased Fiverun Inc. Prices weren't disclosed.\par \par \uc2 The firm merged point-of-sale software company Fiverun with two other portfolio companies to form Kibo Software Inc., a provider of online-commerce software. Fiverun had raised a small first round in 2014 from seed investor Bee Partners and accelerator Orange Fab.\par \par \uc2 Telarix\uc2 , which makes software used by communications services providers, raised $20 million in growth equity in 2010 from Brown Brothers Harriman Capital Partners and Edison Partners. Edison initially backed the company in 2003.\par \par \uc2 Vista is reportedly seeking up to $10 billion for its latest buyout fund to invest in technology companies.\par \par \uc2 Another private-equity firm with deep pockets is \uc2 Thoma Bravo LLC\uc2 , which is said to be loading up its latest fund with up to $7.2 billion. In June, \uc2 Thoma Bravo\uc2  said it agreed to acquire \uc2 Qlik Technologies Inc\uc2 . for about $3 billion. The data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  software company went public in 2010. One of the firm's other portfolio companies, \uc2 Landesk Software Inc\uc2 ., has made seven acquisitions in the past five years. The most recent was \uc2 AppSense Inc\uc2 ., a former venture-backed company that helped businesses manage desktop software.\par \par \uc2 Thoma Bravo\uc2  in September took a majority stake in \uc2 MedeAnalytics Inc\uc2 ., a provider of software used to analyze health-care financial data, for an undisclosed amount. Venture firms Bain Capital Ventures and Emergence Capital stayed on as minority investors.\par \par \uc2 Buyouts of venture-backed companies, relatively rare until after the dot-com bubble, have become more frequent. There were 53 in 2014, 50 in 2015 and 31 so far this year, according to VentureSource.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160705ec75005pr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Social media is a gigantic store of information. But can tweets, likes and posts be used to pick stocks?\par \par \uc2 Although some analysts point to the need for caution, a number of funds have sprung up that seek to use social-media information to generate returns. Perhaps the clearest example of this trend is \uc2 Sprott Buzz Social Media Insights ETF\uc2  (ticker symbol BUZ), which was launched in April. BUZ tracks the Buzz Social Media Insights Index, which analyzes data from social-media comments, blog posts and news articles to identify 25 stocks about which the online community is most bullish.\par \par \uc2 The Buzz index uses an \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  model that deploys \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and algorithms intended to understand the tone of a conversation\u8212\'20\'14even including sarcasm. The index is reset every month, and a company must have a market cap of at least $5 billion to be included, though the stocks being talked about online tend to belong to the largest companies anyway, says Jamie Wise, the founder of Buzz Indexes.\par \par \uc2 The group knows best\par \par \uc2 BUZ's managers won't intervene, even if a stock appears in the index that they don't personally rate.\par \par \uc2 "That collective group decision-making is better than any one individual's ability to pick a stock, and so we're not going to insert ourselves on top of that process," says Mr. Wise.\par \par \uc2 The use of social-media data to inform investments is part of a broader trend toward exploiting \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , or very large sets of information that can be used to identify patterns or trends.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 .'s Scientific Active Equity team uses \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis in a number of its funds, says \uc2 Jeff Shen\uc2 , co-head of investments in the SAE Group and the head of emerging markets at the company. For example, individual investors dominate the Chinese stock market, and it can be difficult to figure out what they are thinking about, he says. The SAE group gathers information from the most popular social-media sites in the country in a bid to gain insight into a market that has been historically difficult to gauge.\par \par \uc2 "When there are a lot of people talking about one particular stock, it will probably give you a sense of the retail attention in that particular name or particular sector," says Mr. Shen.\par \par \uc2 Vote bullish or bearish\par \par \uc2 Other funds seek to gather data directly. CrowdInvest Wisdom ETF (WIZE) tracks an index of 35 stocks that are selected every month based on data gathered from an iOS app. It can be thought of as Tinder (a location-based dating app) for investing, says CrowdInvest Chief Executive Annie Wyatt: Users rate stocks as bullish or bearish, and the most-favored stocks are placed into the index.\par \par \uc2 The app is based on "Wisdom of the Crowd" theory. Ms. Wyatt and her colleagues place no restrictions on who can download the app and vote, meaning a newcomer will be given the same power as an experienced long-term investor. The idea is that the group beats the wisdom of an individual.\par \par \uc2 "We want to make sure that people from all walks of life are coming into the app and voting and expressing their opinions, and we don't ask for any reason why they're expressing these opinions," she says.\par \par \uc2 The potential of all that data is one of the attractions for investors when it comes to social-media companies themselves, says Jay Jacobs, director of research at Global X, whose Social Media Index ETF (SOCL) tracks the performance of the Solactive Social Media Total Return Index.\par \par \uc2 "There are a lot of different uses for that data, and it is a big component of revenues for these companies, so it should not be overlooked as an area of growth," he says.\par \par \uc2 PureFunds ISE \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  ETF\uc2  (BIGD) aims to track the companies that are mining and analyzing the data. The fund was launched in July 2015, with the aim of tapping into the growing industry, say PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin.\par \par \uc2 "I think people are going to become aware of how big this industry is.\u8230\'20\'26 If you're watching the financial news, it is tough to go an hour without hearing companies promoting their \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  solutions or analysts talking about the space or companies in the space," he says.\par \par \uc2 Critics weigh in\par \par \uc2 Still, the use of social-media data and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  more broadly has its critics. While social media can be an important source of information and can capture trends in the market, it will prompt most serious investors to carry out their own research, rather than relying on it directly for making an investment decision, says \uc2 Neena Mishra\uc2 , director of ETF Research at \uc2 Zacks Investment Research\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I don't think these can supplant the human analyst, at least not in the near term," she says. "True, machines can process and analyze data much quicker compared with humans, but the challenge lies in deciding the importance of each piece of information in the investment decision."\par \par \uc2 Kiril Nikolaev, a financial analyst at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://etfdb.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ETFdb.com}}}\uc2 , also believes that while \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis is increasingly important, it has potential drawbacks. For example, if everyone starts using the same or similar models to analyze information, the advantage will soon be "crowded out," he says.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cowan is a writer in London.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . is locked in major tussles with local rivals in China and India, but a homegrown upstart is also grabbing an advantage in the race for another Asia prize.\par \par \uc2 A startup called Grab is winning ride-hailing turf in Southeast Asia\u8212\'20\'14home to 600 million people, almost double the population of the U.S. The startup serves more cities in the region than Uber and, according to mobile-app \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 App Annie\uc2 , is beating the world's most valuable startup in the race for users here.\par \par \uc2 The region's ride-hailing market is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion last year, according to a recent report on Southeast Asia's internet economy conducted by \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and Singapore state-investment firm \uc2 Temasek Holdings\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Singapore-based \uc2 GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd\uc2 ., as it is formally known, launched in 2012 and offers locally tailored services such as motorcycle taxis\u8212\'20\'14a popular method for negotiating the region's traffic-clogged cities\u8212\'20\'14package deliveries and cash payment. It also has a pilot carpooling service allowing people living in southern Malaysia, where living costs are lower than in neighboring Singapore, to share rides into the city-state.\par \par \uc2 In four years, the company, valued at $1.6 billion in its most recent funding round last year, has expanded to 1,600 employees. It operates in 30 Southeast Asian cities\u8212\'20\'14twice as many as Uber\u8212\'20\'14in six countries.\par \par \uc2 Even so, Grab faces a tough fight against Uber, a global powerhouse valued at close to $68 billion. It has raised $14 billion in debt and equity, providing it with a massive war chest for global expansion\u8212\'20\'14and local turf wars.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman said Uber is "part of everyday life for millions across Southeast Asia," where the company is "led by local teams."\par \par \uc2 Grab has some significant investors in its corner. In addition to U.S. hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and \uc2 Tiger Global Management\uc2 , it has received funding from Uber's biggest competitor in China: Didi Chuxing Technology Co., the country's largest ride-sharing company.\par \par \uc2 Grab has also joined Didi, ANI Technologies Pvt.'s Ola in India and San Francisco startup \uc2 Lyft Inc\uc2 . in a global alliance of Uber rivals. They work together to allow users of each company's app to hail rides from the other apps' drivers in other countries.\par \par \uc2 Grab's co-founder, \uc2 Anthony Tan\uc2 , a 34-year-old Malaysian who dreamed up the venture with a classmate at \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 , said he envisions the company as a sprawling, web-based platform, leveraging its location data to offer services beyond rides, such as digital payments.\par \par \uc2 "We don't think only about transport," said Mr. Tan, also Grab's chief executive, in an interview at the company's Singapore headquarters, a modest space in an office park where new taxi drivers come to sign up. "How do we build a Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent?" he said, referring to China's three leading internet companies, which dominate that country's search, e-commerce and social-media markets.\par \par \uc2 Grab has banked close to two-thirds of the almost $700 million it has raised from investors and isn't in need of additional funds at the moment, Mr. Tan said. The company is profitable in some cities in which it operates, he said, though he declined to forecast when the company will turn a profit overall.\par \par \uc2 In a region where few people have credit cards and many lack bank accounts, Grab first offered cash payments for users and drivers alike. It recently added motorbike taxis in cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta so commuters use can weave through traffic gridlock. Uber has since followed.\par \par \uc2 Grab also offers a package-delivery service designed to assist the region's e-commerce startups, which sometimes struggle to get items to customers in places that lack traditional addresses or where roads are poor. Uber has a delivery service, but it isn't available outside the U.S.\par \par \uc2 In Indonesia, Grab has worked to augment third-party maps by adding points of interest for pickups and drop-offs at locations not otherwise covered, like warungs\u8212\'20\'14roadside stalls where people often congregate to buy goods or socialize.\par \par \uc2 Uber's innovations include the UberEats on-demand food-delivery service, which gained its first Asian location in May with a launch in Singapore. The company's carpool service, UberPool, was expanded from Jakarta and Manila to Singapore last week.\par \par \uc2 Uber's huge cash pile means it can afford to hire top engineering talent and develop cutting-edge technologies. It could also allow it to spend money for longer than the less-deep-pocketed Grab, analysts say, potentially wearing it down over the long haul.\par \par \uc2 Then there is a technological barrier both companies face: While Southeast Asia's population is large, many consumers still lack web access, meaning they can't use the apps.\par \par \uc2 Neither Grab nor Uber discloses user numbers, but Grab's app topped Uber's in first-quarter downloads for both Android and Apple devices in every market in which Grab operates: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, according to \uc2 App Annie\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Grab also leads Uber in monthly active users in "a number of Southeast Asian markets" on Android smartphones, which dominate the region, \uc2 App Annie\uc2  estimates. The company doesn't give out numbers.\par \par \uc2 Grab says its app has been downloaded more than 15 million times. An Uber spokesman declined to comment on \uc2 App Annie\uc2 's data, or disclose any user or download data for Southeast Asia.\par \par \uc2 Florian Hoppe, a consultant at \uc2 Bain & Company\uc2 , said "it's hard for [Uber] to tailor to unique local requirements" in the region, while Singapore-based Grab understands what Southeast Asian consumers need. He pointed to Grab's service connecting commuters in Malaysia to Singapore as an example.\par \par \uc2 "That's the gap" Grab has taken advantage of, he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Resty Woro Yuniar contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Newley Purnell at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:newley.purnell @wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 newley.purnell @wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160705ec75003xs\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Non-performing loans have increased over the past five years, making bankers more hesitant to lend to private sector entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 The problem is even more acute in rural areas, according to Mr Liu, who made his initial fortune in the agricultural sector. Mr Liu\u8217\'20\'19s New Hope Group was established in Sichuan province in 1982.\par \par \uc2 Farmers are not allowed to own land but instead lease it from the state, so cannot use it as collateral to secure bank loans.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA big ship is difficult to turn round,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Liu, \u8220\'20\'1C[China\u8217\'20\'19s state] banks want to change but are too big to do so.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Liu has a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.forbes.com/profile/liu-yonghao/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 net worth of $4.1bn }}}\uc2  and is ranked number 28 in China on the Forbes Billionaires List from 2016.\par \par \uc2 The Chinese government has identified the private sector\u8217\'20\'19s funding challenges as a vital policy challenge. Last year it started a pilot programme that has approved the establishment of seven privately owned banks.\par \par \uc2 Mr Liu\u8217\'20\'19s new internet finance venture, Sichuan Hope Bank, received its final regulatory approvals in June. It is a joint venture with Xiaomi, the smartphone manufacturer, and a Sichuan-based supermarket chain, Chengdu Hongqi.\par \par \uc2 Mr Liu and his partners embraced an online business model to avoid the costs associated with bricks-and-mortar branches. Credit risk will be assessed through automated systems in an effort to hasten lending approvals and level the playing field for small start-ups.\par \par \uc2 Sichuan Hope Bank is not the first to embrace mobile banking platforms and use \u8220\'20\'1C\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D to assess client risks. Tencent\u8217\'20\'19s WeBank, for example, reviews loan applicants\u8217\'20\'19 comments and posts on its popular \uc2 WeChat\uc2  messaging service.\par \par \uc2 New Hope Group has a record of lending to rural start-ups: eight years ago, it branched out from selling pig feed and equipment to providing trade financing for farmers who wanted to set up small pig-farming factories.\par \par \uc2 Although the farmers would come to New Hope without business experience, Mr Liu felt he could identify the successful type. \u8220\'20\'1CThey could understand markets from doing labour in the cities,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Liu said he felt confident lending to them, especially former migrant workers who had returned home.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160703ec73000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\uc2 , which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/top-wall-street-regulators-salary-approaches-3-million-1467389380"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 paid its chief executive officer $2.9 million last year}}}\uc2 , doesn't pay to compete with other rule writers\u8212\'20\'14it compensates its executives like Wall Street does.\par \par \uc2 Finra, which oversees stockbrokers and monitors trading on equity and options exchanges, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2015_YIR_AFR.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 disclosed Thursday}}}\uc2  that eight of its senior executives earned more than $1 million in total compensation last year. It benchmarks its salaries against "a broad section of financial services and capital markets companies, as this is the most likely sector from which Finra will recruit talent," according to its most recent annual report.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the Wall Street overseer acknowledges there aren't many substitutes for what it does, meaning a securities lawyer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wouldn't do the same job at Finra. "Defining the relevant employment market for competitive compensation benchmarking purposes is a significant challenge for Finra due to the scarcity of natural comparisons," it said in the annual report.\par \par \uc2 CEO \uc2 Richard Ketchum\uc2 , who has announced he is retiring later this year, earned $1 million in base salary and $1.5 million in incentive compensation. The rest of his pay came from deferred compensation and other benefits, according to the report issued Thursday. Before joining Finra, he was CEO of the regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange. He also worked on Wall Street as general counsel of Citigroup Inc.'s corporate and investment bank from 2003 to 2004.\par \par \uc2 Chief Financial Officer Todd Diganci, who was paid nearly $1.4 million, has worked at Finra for 21 years, according to his \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  resume. Chief Information Officer Steven Randich, who got nearly $1.3 million, was co-CIO of Citigroup before joining Finra, his \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  biography shows.\par \par \uc2 The regulator's board of directors awarded those salaries even as Finra posted a net loss of $39.5 million for 2015, driven by what it said were bigger expenses for cloud-based computing investments. Compensation and benefits expenses increased 5.5% in 2015 from 2014.\par \par \uc2 In a letter issued with Finra's annual report, Mr. Ketchum wrote that his organization's responsibilities and technology prowess has grown significantly since he took over in 2009. That year, the market regulator monitored on average 2.3 billion quotes, orders and trade each day. It now processes as many as 75 billion pieces of market data every day.\par \par \uc2 "This dramatic growth in Finra's ability to process and monitor massive amounts of data is reflective of the tremendous steps we have taken over the past seven years to improve our regulatory oversight of the complex and interconnected U.S. securities markets," Mr. Ketchum wrote.\par \par \uc2 Finra occupies a unique position in the realm of market regulation. While it is not a government agency, it can penalize brokers for regulatory violations. Rules that it passes, which affect how brokers interact with their customers, must be approved by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , whose chairman, \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2 , earns $165,300.\par \par \uc2 At first glance, Finra's decision to compare its salaries to Wall Street's looks reasonable, said \uc2 Alan Johnson\uc2 , a compensation consultant for financial-services companies. But a private regulatory organization doesn't face the same checks on pay that businesses and law firms do, such as angry shareholders or clients that push back on big legal bills, he said.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think it's thought of as well as the SEC, and the SEC does not pay comparable with industry," said Mr. Johnson, managing director of \uc2 Johnson Associates\uc2 . "For the money they're paying, are they getting the results and accountability that some would expect? I think within the industry that is certainly an open question."\par \par \uc2 Earlier in his career, Mr. Ketchum was a top brokerage and exchange regulator at the SEC. Other former SEC officials, including Finra's Chief Risk Officer Carlo di Florio and Erozan Kurtas, hired as Finra's head of advanced data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , have left the government and moved directly to Finra, where salaries are much higher.\par \par \uc2 Some U.S. lawmakers have in recent months questioned Finra's duties and the SEC's ability to oversee it. In a letter issued June 6, Sen. John Boozman (R., Ark.) and Rep. Ander Crenshaw (R., Fla.) demanded Ms. White explain how the SEC oversees Finra's budget and its enforcement function.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ketchum will be succeeded by Robert Cook, a former SEC official who is a partner at law firm \uc2 Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\uc2 . Mr. Cook is scheduled to become Finra's CEO in late August or early September. Finra has declined to disclose Mr. Cook's pay until next year, when it issues its next annual report.\par \par \uc2 Write to Dave Michaels at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:dave.michaels@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dave.michaels@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160701ec7100b6w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Next World Capital has added a fourth general partner, promoting Tom Rikert to that position. Mr. Rikert {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120141124eaboahlts"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 joined Next World}}}\uc2  as a partner in 2014 after spending two years as a partner at \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He led {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nextworldcap.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Next World's}}}\uc2  investments in drone startup Airware, marketing \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  startup Origami Logic Inc. and energy \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  startup \uc2 FirstFuel Software Inc\uc2 ., and focuses on the tech areas of internet of things, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and software delivered as a service to vertical markets.\par \par \uc2 The promotion won't change Mr. Rikert's day-to-day responsibilities because he is already leading deals and taking board seats, according to Next World co-founder and General Partner Craig Hanson, but it demonstrates "our show of faith and support in him," Mr. Hanson said. "It's not hard to find good VCs, but it's more rare to find people who are good investors and want to be great builders of firms."\par \par \uc2 Next World is based in San Francisco and invests in enterprise tech startups that are hitting what the firm calls "early revenue stage," meaning they are generally raising Series B and C rounds.\par \par \uc2 The venture firm spun out of global investment firm Next World Group in 2009 and also has offices in London and Paris. It specializes in helping its portfolio companies expand in Europe. Top executives from large European companies serve as Next World advisors, Mr. Hanson said, and Next World holds events for these advisers and its portfolio companies and also has an innovation center in San Francisco that brings European executives to the Bay Area to learn about the latest technology.\par \par \uc2 Given the investment climate in the Bay Area this year, with falling valuations and a glut of seed-backed startups that are running out of money, Next World's deal flow is up dramatically since January, Mr. Hanson said.\par \par \uc2 If the firm was tracking five startups in an area, it is now tracking about 15, he said, "and our biggest work right now is handling the opportunities we're looking at and still looking for that rare fantastic company" to back.\par \par \uc2 Next World is raising a new fund, according to a May regulatory filing, which said the firm has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/next-world-capital-gathers-122-8m-for-enterprise-technology-fund-1462914850"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 raised $122.8 million}}}\uc2  toward a second fund that the firm hoped could reach $125 million. Mr. Hanson declined to comment on fundraising.\par \par \uc2 Next World's other two general partners are \uc2 Ben Fu\uc2  and founder Sebastien Lepinard.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160701ec7100bhx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- After \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . unexpectedly failed the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's annual stress tests in March 2014, the bank opened its checkbook and called in the consultants.\par \par \uc2 The firm had to address several of the regulator's concerns in a short time frame, and no single consulting firm could do the job, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank hired multiple firms and said it spent about $180 million on stress tests during the second half of 2014. The next year, it passed.\par \par \uc2 The stress tests -- designed to determine whether banks can withstand severe economic shocks -- have made U.S. banks stronger. Also more robust is the multibillion-dollar industry that has developed around the annual exercise. Last week, the Fed said the 33 largest U.S. banks cleared the first round of stress tests. On Wednesday, the firms will find out which ones can boost dividends or buy back shares.\par \par \uc2 Globally, banks spent about $29 billion on consultants last year, much of that for stress tests in the U.S. and elsewhere, according to analysis firm ALM Intelligence. That compares with $16.35 billion in 2007. The total has increased every year since 2009, a period when banks have been relentlessly cutting expenses and employees in areas such as trading and branches.\par \par \uc2 The Big Four accounting firms and Big Three consulting firms all have built practices offering manpower and advice to pass regulatory muster. Big financial advisers are also in on the act. Last year, \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . sold forecasting help to about two-thirds of the banks taking the tests.\par \par \uc2 There are even consultants offering advice on the most economical use of other stress-test consultants.\par \par \uc2 "Kick out the consultants," risk analysis firm Novantas advertised recently, telling banks it can help them cut back.\par \par \uc2 The industry has sprung up because failing the stress tests, which the Fed made mandatory in their current form in 2011, can have grave consequences. Banks that don't pass the test can be limited in their ability to raise dividends or buy back shares.\par \par \uc2 The early versions of the tests helped stem the global financial crisis in 2009 by showing big banks weren't about to collapse. Since then, both regulators and bankers said the exams have made banks such as \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  better able to weather shocks like the British vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One executive said this year's scenario -- which included negative interest rates, along with a 10% unemployment rate and a roughly 50% drop in the stock market -- helped catch flaws in systems that weren't ready to compute rates below zero.\par \par \uc2 But many question whether the Fed is going overboard. Rob Nichols, president of industry group the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2 , last week called the tests "unrealistically severe" and "unnecessarily opaque." The Fed has made the tests harder to pass each year and surprised banks such as \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  by flunking them for risk-management practices. Hence, the need for heavy spending each round to adapt to the new versions of the tests.\par \par \uc2 Banks are expected to quantify precisely how much money they would lose under the scenarios, a herculean task for firms with global footprints, taking hundreds of mathematical models to predict the behavior of millions of assets. Each loan or investment has unique characteristics a bank must gather, track, check and recheck.\par \par \uc2 Banks generally underinvested in those skills before 2008, one reason they were hit so hard by the downturn.\par \par \uc2 The test submissions include a "narrative" document the size of a thick paperback, describing what the firm has done, accompanied by thousands of pages of documentation. Some banks employ professional writers to pen the narratives' chapters, so the Fed will have fewer questions when it examines the firms.\par \par \uc2 In all, building a stress-test program can cost banks $150 million to $250 million apiece at the start.\par \par \uc2 Financial firms globally will spend $4 billion on stress-test information technology this year, estimates Chartist Research. That is up from $3 billion in 2014 and is expected to increase 15% in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Forecasting models generally range in cost from about $100,000 to more than $1 million, depending on their complexity.\par \par \uc2 "We offer customized and off-the-shelf models to help you calculate the stressed probability of defaults," reads a "Stress Testing Suites" brochure from Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc., a unit of \uc2 Moody's Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The banks taking the Fed exams treat stress-test preparation like its own business line, often paying the executives who lead the effort seven-figure salaries.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., the largest U.S. bank by assets, last year had about 550 people working solely on the Fed stress tests, with more than 2,000 employees contributing indirectly, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 "It's like a whole new department at the bank," said \uc2 Joe Sullivan\uc2 , president of International Market Recruiters, which helps banks fill stress-testing jobs.\par \par \uc2 Stress has become a problem among stress-test employees, who often race to finish the exams before the Fed's deadline. The night before submissions are due, bank employees have had to stay up loading documents onto the Fed's slow-moving website, one of many late nights.\par \par \uc2 The test due date for years was January, notoriously ruining bankers' year-end holidays. In sympathy, the Fed this year changed the tests' due date to April, though one banker pointed out that conflicted with spring breaks instead.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the goal is for banks to scale back this mammoth exercise, for executives to have a kind of "push-button" ability to quickly assess their risk, said Michael Alix, who was a senior executive at Bear Stearns during its near-collapse in 2008 and a former \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York\uc2  official who now advises banks on the tests as financial services consulting risk leader at \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Banks continue to build up their teams.\par \par \uc2 The posting for a \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  job in Mumbai analyzing the bank's risks there and reporting up to the U.S. parent asks for: "Strong attention to detail, willingness to 'roll up sleeves' and produce a polished, high quality, accurate product; tireless work ethic with ability to work well under pressure."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Emily Glazer and Sarah Krouse contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20160629000012"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020160824ec6t0003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Anyone who believes that the merger between Germany's \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  and the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  is going ahead must have their head buried in the sand. Just like the people who designed the deal.\par \par \uc2 It was meant to bring together London, Europe's leading financial hub, with Frankfurt, the home of the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 , to create a behemoth able to trade in equities and futures, and supply benchmarks, index and data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . When it was first announced in February, both sides were publicly dismissive of the impact of a British vote to leave the \uc2 EU\uc2  - and it appears the deal terms were designed with similar insouciance. These terms cannot now be changed - making the likelihood of the deal closing vanishingly small, despite reassuring utterances by both companies to the contrary.\par \par \uc2 It is not unusual for the architects of a deal to become so fixated on getting it done that they fail to focus on what might derail it. Mergers and acquisitions history is littered with the corpses of overconfident companies that were unable to get their deals from the drawing board to the board room. Nor are \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  and the \uc2 LSE\uc2  the only members of the business community to have underestimated and underprepared for a Brexit. A lack of contingency planning as well as a fastidious refusal to dirty their hands in the political debate have left many other businesses scrambling to react to the vote. A survey of corporate clients by one big advisory group on Friday found that a staggering four-fifths had neither a Brexit response committee set up, nor a specific plan for what to do if the outcome was for Leave.\par \par \uc2 This complacency is shocking. But more so at \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  and the \uc2 LSE\uc2 . When the deal was unveiled, advisers to both were keen to suggest that their timing was cunning. This bid, they said, had been deliberately launched amid the political uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum to "steal a march on US rivals". They said the risk of Brexit "provided the camouflage" under which the deal terms were finalised. Quite how clever that was is now moot.\par \par \uc2 Since Friday, both companies have put a reassuring gloss on the referendum news. They were committed, according to statements on Friday and again yesterday, to the deal's agreed and binding terms, irrespective of the vote, and the outcome did not affect its "compelling strategic rationale". Behind the scenes, though, it was a different story, with senior managers at the \uc2 LSE\uc2  privately acknowledging that the deal would be the first corporate casualty of the vote.\par \par \uc2 There was good reason for their gloom: those "agreed and binding terms". Because they cannot be tinkered with, and because they state that the combined companies' headquarters will be in London, they make the deal highly unlikely to close. German regulators - not to mention politicians - were already queasy at the prospect of a London HQ, and are even more likely to put their foot down now given that, after a Brexit, London's financial activities will not be overseen by Europe. Putting the HQ of the merged company in a city no longer able to trade freely with the bloc also reduces the financial logic of the deal - as does the sharp fall in sterling since Friday.\par \par \uc2 A particular spanner in the works is likely to be the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 's demand that the future clearing of euro-denominated derivatives transactions takes place inside the \uc2 EU\uc2 . That would entail routing trades through a city such as Paris or Frankfurt, rather than London.\par \par \uc2 All these consequences to a Brexit vote were foreseeable at the time the deal was announced and its terms were designed. But this was a pet project of \uc2 Xavier Rolet\uc2  , the chief executive of the LSE and it provided a dramatic start to \uc2 Carsten Kengeter\uc2  's new job as chief executive of \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 . Such considerations, it appears, trumped any proper evaluation of the risks.\par \par \uc2 Millions of pounds will already have been spent on lawyers, PR executives and other advisers to this deal, as well as thousands of management hours. Messrs Kengeter and Rolet are unlikely to take personal responsibility for the deal falling through, rather as the UK's political leaders have brushed off their share of the blame for last week's referendum outcome. A six-person referendum committee drawn from the boards of both companies and led by \uc2 Joachim Faber\uc2 , \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 's supervisory board chairman, will now meet to "work through the challenges" the Brexit vote has posed.\par \par \uc2 This will be a further waste of time and shareholders' money for a deal that no longer makes sense.\par \par \uc2 sarah.gordon@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160630ec6u0002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

"Consistent failure to produce accurate data is just unacceptable."\par \par \uc2 A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment. The firm didn't admit or deny the charges, but consented to the entry of the findings, according to Finra. The bank also has agreed to employ an independent consultant to help improve its procedures related to blue-sheet submissions, said Finra.\par \par \uc2 Data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  have become a driving force in regulation, with proponents arguing that access to timely and accurate data can allow regulators to act more swiftly to stop activity that could hurt investors.\par \par \uc2 As such, regulators have been looking closely at data production from brokerages and brought a number of enforcement cases against firms in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Late last year, Finra fined a unit of \uc2 Macquarie Group Ltd\uc2 . $2.95 million for inaccurate blue-sheet data, while the U.S. arm of \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-in-sec-pact-over-blue-sheet-submissions-1443469915"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 agreed to pay $4.25 million for deficient blue-sheet data}}}\uc2  in a settlement with the SEC in September.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 , Finra said it found the firm had multiple failures in the system it uses to put together and submit its blue-sheet data between 2008 and 2015, affecting thousands of submissions and more than 1 million trades.\par \par \uc2 The regulator also found that between January 2014 and August 2015 about 40% of the global investment bank's blue-sheet submissions missed the required 10-business-day deadline for responding to requests. That portion was 90% between July and August 2015.\par \par \uc2 Write to Anna Prior at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:anna.prior@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 anna.prior@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160629ec6t008hr\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc32}{\*\bkmkend toc32}\b \uc2 LSE-Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse dealmakers were wrong to ignore Brexit risk\b0\par\par\uc2 Sarah Gordon \par \uc2 801 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par 05:04\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Anyone who believes that the merger between Germany\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  and the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  is going ahead must have their head buried in the sand. Just like the people who designed the deal.\par \par \uc2 It was meant to bring together London, Europe\u8217\'20\'19s leading financial hub, with Frankfurt, the home of the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 , to create a behemoth able to trade in equities and futures, and supply benchmarks, index and data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . When it was first announced in February, both sides were publicly dismissive of the impact of a British vote to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/thirdpartywrapper/webappliveeurope"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 leave the EU }}}\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 and it appears the deal terms were designed with similar insouciance. These terms cannot now be changed \u8212\'20\'14 making the likelihood of the deal closing vanishingly small, despite reassuring utterances by both companies to the contrary.\par \par \uc2 It is not unusual for the architects of a deal to become so fixated on getting it done that they fail to focus on what might derail it. Mergers and acquisitions history is littered with the corpses of overconfident companies that were unable to get their deals from the drawing board to the board room. Nor are \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  and the \uc2 LSE\uc2  the only members of the business community to have underestimated and underprepared for a Brexit. A lack of contingency planning as well as a fastidious refusal to dirty their hands in the political debate have left many other businesses scrambling to react to the vote. A survey of corporate clients by one big advisory group on Friday found that a staggering four-fifths had neither a Brexit response committee set up, nor a specific plan for what to do if the outcome was for Leave.\par \par \uc2 This complacency is shocking. But more so at \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  and the \uc2 LSE\uc2 . When the deal was unveiled, advisers to both were keen to suggest that their timing was cunning. This bid, they said, had been deliberately launched amid the political uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum to \u8220\'20\'1Csteal a march on US rivals\u8221\'20\'1D. They said the risk of Brexit \u8220\'20\'1Cprovided the camouflage\u8221\'20\'1D under which the deal terms were finalised. Quite how clever that was is now moot.\par \par \uc2 Since Friday, both companies have put a reassuring gloss on the news of the referendum\u8217\'20\'19s result. They were committed, according to joint statements on Friday and again on Wednesday, to the deal\u8217\'20\'19s agreed and binding terms, irrespective of the vote, and the outcome did not affect its \u8220\'20\'1Ccompelling strategic rationale\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Behind the scenes, though, it was a different story, with senior managers at the \uc2 LSE\uc2  privately acknowledging that the deal would be the first corporate casualty of the vote.\par \par \uc2 There was good reason for their gloom: those \u8220\'20\'1Cagreed and binding terms\u8221\'20\'1D. Because they cannot be tinkered with, and because they state that the combined companies\u8217\'20\'19 headquarters will be in London, they make the deal highly unlikely to close. German regulators \u8212\'20\'14 not to mention politicians \u8212\'20\'14 were already queasy at the prospect of a London HQ, and are even more likely to put their foot down now given that, after a Brexit, London\u8217\'20\'19s financial activities will not be overseen by Europe.\par \par \uc2 Putting the HQ of the merged company in a city no longer able to trade freely with the bloc also reduces the financial logic of the deal \u8212\'20\'14 as does the sharp fall in sterling since Friday.\par \par \uc2 A particular spanner in the works is likely to be the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s demand that the future clearing of euro-denominated derivatives transactions takes place inside the \uc2 EU\uc2 . That would entail routing trades through a city such as Paris or Frankfurt, rather than London.\par \par \uc2 All these consequences to a Brexit vote were foreseeable at the time the deal was announced and its terms were designed. But this was a pet project of \uc2 Xavier Rolet\uc2 , the chief executive of the LSE and it provided a dramatic start to \uc2 Carsten Kengeter\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s new job as chief executive of \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 . Such considerations, it appears, trumped any proper evaluation of the risks.\par \par \uc2 Millions of pounds will already have been spent on lawyers, PR executives and other advisers to this deal, as well as thousands of management hours. Messrs Kengeter and Rolet are unlikely to take personal responsibility for the deal falling through, rather as the UK\u8217\'20\'19s political leaders have brushed off their share of the blame for last week\u8217\'20\'19s referendum outcome. A six-person referendum committee drawn from the boards of both companies and led by \uc2 Joachim Faber\uc2 , \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s supervisory board chairman, will now meet to \u8220\'20\'1Cwork through the challenges\u8221\'20\'1D the Brexit vote has posed.\par \par \uc2 This will be a further waste of time and shareholders\u8217\'20\'19 money for a deal that no longer makes sense.\par \par \uc2 sarah.gordon@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170227ec6t003xp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Britain's decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  could benefit a group thousands of miles away: U.S. homeowners.\par \par \uc2 Several lenders posted rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages of about 3.5% on Monday, nearing a 3.5-year low, and analysts expect coming reports to show that average U.S. mortgage rates have decreased since the Brexit vote Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The main reason: Investors have flocked to the safety of U.S. Treasurys, pushing interest rates lower as riskier assets such as stocks tumbled. Mortgage rates tend to move up and down with 10-year Treasury rates, though the relationship isn't perfect.\par \par \uc2 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 1.460% on Tuesday, down from 1.579% before the result of Thursday's vote was announced and 2.273% at the end of 2015, according to \uc2 Tradeweb\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Last Wednesday, the \uc2 Mortgage Bankers Association\uc2  reported that the average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.76%. Housing-market analysts will be watching closely on Wednesday when the MBA releases its next weekly report.\par \par \uc2 If mortgage rates decline, that could be a boon both to prospective home buyers and to homeowners who qualify for refinancing. Refinancing could make sense for many people locked into rates of 4% or higher, according to mortgage experts.\par \par \uc2 Lenders are expecting a miniwave of refinancing in coming weeks. In all, 40% of borrowers have loans with a rate of 4.5% or higher, according to \uc2 CoreLogic Inc\uc2 ., a real-estate \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm, meaning they could save about $90 a month on average by refinancing at 3.5%.\par \par \uc2 Lenders across the country said refinancing applications since Thursday are up between 10% to 40% compared with typical volume this time of year.\par \par \uc2 "Unless we see interest rates tick back up, I think we will see a boomlet" in refinancing activity, said Bob Walters, chief economist at Detroit-based \uc2 Quicken Loans Inc\uc2 ., the country's third-largest mortgage lender. Mr. Walters said Quicken is seeing refinancing applications up 30% to 40% compared with typical volume.\par \par \uc2 Because mortgage rates have been near multidecade lows for the past six years, most borrowers who could refinance already have done so. Those who held back largely did so because their home was still underwater or their credit was poor.\par \par \uc2 But strong home-price growth in the past several months has helped increase the pool of borrowers with equity in their homes who are eligible to refinance. About 13% of homeowners owe more than their home is worth, down from a high of 31% in 2012, according to Zillow, a real-estate research firm.\par \par \uc2 The Brexit vote is expected to usher in a period of economic uncertainty across Europe as companies and investors pause to weigh the impact and seek out safe investments such as government bonds. Economic turbulence could prompt the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  to hold off on raising interest rates until next year, which would likely help keep mortgage rates low, economists said.\par \par \uc2 Economists said major global economic shocks tend to boost refinancing activity because homeowners have learned over the years to expect the possibility that rates will fall. Some economists and executives said they expect the impact will be longer lasting than that of other recent shocks, such as the Greek debt crisis several years ago or the Chinese stock-market tumble last August and this January.\par \par \uc2 "I think this will have some legs on it," said Mr. Walters of Quicken Loans.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160629000016"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec6t0005i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- After \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . unexpectedly failed the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's annual stress tests in March 2014, the bank opened its checkbook and called in the consultants.\par \par \uc2 The firm had to address several of the regulator's concerns in a short time frame, and no single consulting firm could do the job, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank hired multiple firms and said it spent about $180 million on stress tests during the second half of 2014. The next year, it passed.\par \par \uc2 The stress tests -- designed to determine whether banks can withstand severe economic shocks -- have made U.S. banks stronger. Also more robust is the multibillion-dollar industry that has developed around the annual exercise. Last week, the Fed said the 33 largest U.S. banks cleared the first round of stress tests. On Wednesday, the firms will find out which ones can boost dividends or buy back shares.\par \par \uc2 Globally, banks spent about $29 billion on consultants last year, much of that for stress tests in the U.S. and elsewhere, according to analysis firm ALM Intelligence. That compares with $16.35 billion in 2007. The total has increased every year since 2009, a period when banks have been relentlessly cutting expenses and employees in areas such as trading and branches.\par \par \uc2 The Big Four accounting firms and Big Three consulting firms all have built practices offering manpower and advice to pass regulatory muster. Big financial advisers are also in on the act. Last year, \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . sold forecasting help to about two-thirds of the banks taking the tests.\par \par \uc2 There are even consultants offering advice on the most economical use of other stress-test consultants.\par \par \uc2 "Kick out the consultants," risk analysis firm Novantas advertised recently, telling banks it can help them cut back.\par \par \uc2 The industry has sprung up because failing the stress tests, which the Fed made mandatory in their current form in 2011, can have grave consequences. Banks that don't pass the test can be limited in their ability to raise dividends or buy back shares.\par \par \uc2 The early versions of the tests helped stem the global financial crisis in 2009 by showing big banks weren't about to collapse. Since then, both regulators and bankers said the exams have made banks such as \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  better able to weather shocks like the British vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One executive said this year's scenario -- which included negative interest rates, along with a 10% unemployment rate and a roughly 50% drop in the stock market -- helped catch flaws in systems that weren't ready to compute rates below zero.\par \par \uc2 But many question whether the Fed is going overboard. Rob Nichols, president of industry group the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2 , last week called the tests "unrealistically severe" and "unnecessarily opaque." The Fed has made the tests harder to pass each year and surprised banks such as \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  by flunking them for risk-management practices. Hence, the need for heavy spending each round to adapt to the new versions of the tests.\par \par \uc2 Banks are expected to quantify precisely how much money they would lose under the scenarios, a herculean task for firms with global footprints, taking hundreds of mathematical models to predict the behavior of millions of assets. Each loan or investment has unique characteristics a bank must gather, track, check and recheck.\par \par \uc2 Banks generally underinvested in those skills before 2008, one reason they were hit so hard by the downturn.\par \par \uc2 The test submissions include a "narrative" document the size of a thick paperback, describing what the firm has done, accompanied by thousands of pages of documentation. Some banks employ professional writers to pen the narratives' chapters, so the Fed will have fewer questions when it examines the firms.\par \par \uc2 In all, building a stress-test program can cost banks $150 million to $250 million apiece at the start.\par \par \uc2 Financial firms globally will spend $4 billion on stress-test information technology this year, estimates Chartist Research. That is up from $3 billion in 2014 and is expected to increase 15% in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Forecasting models generally range in cost from about $100,000 to more than $1 million, depending on their complexity.\par \par \uc2 "We offer customized and off-the-shelf models to help you calculate the stressed probability of defaults," reads a "Stress Testing Suites" brochure from Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc., a unit of \uc2 Moody's Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The banks taking the Fed exams treat stress-test preparation like its own business line, often paying the executives who lead the effort seven-figure salaries.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., the largest U.S. bank by assets, last year had about 550 people working solely on the Fed stress tests, with more than 2,000 employees contributing indirectly, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 "It's like a whole new department at the bank," said \uc2 Joe Sullivan\uc2 , president of International Market Recruiters, which helps banks fill stress-testing jobs.\par \par \uc2 Stress has become a problem among stress-test employees, who often race to finish the exams before the Fed's deadline. The night before submissions are due, bank employees have had to stay up loading documents onto the Fed's slow-moving website, one of many late nights.\par \par \uc2 The test due date for years was January, notoriously ruining bankers' year-end holidays. In sympathy, the Fed this year changed the tests' due date to April, though one banker pointed out that conflicted with spring breaks instead.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the goal is for banks to scale back this mammoth exercise, for executives to have a kind of "push-button" ability to quickly assess their risk, said Michael Alix, who was a senior executive at Bear Stearns during its near-collapse in 2008 and a former \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York\uc2  official who now advises banks on the tests as financial services consulting risk leader at \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Banks continue to build up their teams.\par \par \uc2 The posting for a \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  job in Mumbai analyzing the bank's risks there and reporting up to the U.S. parent asks for: "Strong attention to detail, willingness to 'roll up sleeves' and produce a polished, high quality, accurate product; tireless work ethic with ability to work well under pressure."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Emily Glazer and Sarah Krouse contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160629000006"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec6t0004u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Pamlico Capital Management, which traces it roots to the private-equity arm of \uc2 Wachovia Corp\uc2 ., received regulatory clearance to back PrizeLogic LLC, according to an early antitrust filing with the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The FTC issues early antitrust notifications when the agency and the \uc2 U.S. Department of Justice\uc2  don't think a proposed deal, if completed, would violate U.S. antitrust laws. Early antitrust clearance doesn't necessarily indicate a deal has closed or will close.\par \par \uc2 Pamlico secured clearance to purchase the stake in PrizeLogic from shareholder \uc2 Kenneth Barnett\uc2 , who is the global chief executive of Mars Agency and an advisory board member of early-stage venture firm Mars Ventures. Mr. Barnett also has owned or continues to own other digital marketing companies, including social marketing company \uc2 Collective Bias Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Triad Retail Media\uc2 , which was sold to an investment banking team in 2009, according to his biography on Mars Ventures' website.\par \par \uc2 According to the filing, Pamlico would invest in PrizeLogic from Pamlico Capital III LP, a $650 million fund the firm raised in 2013. The Charlotte, N.C., firm typically invests $20 million to $100 million of equity per deal in companies with annual revenue of $15 million to $200 million.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2008, PrizeLogic offers digital-rewards programs and promotion-management services to a range of corporate clients, including \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 ., \uc2 MillerCoors\uc2 , Subway Group and \uc2 Walt Disney Co\uc2 . In addition to its corporate locations in Southfield, Mich., and Scottsdale, Ariz., the company has offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.\par \par \uc2 In the past year, the company has been beefing up its senior management team. Last year, it hired Jeff Blackman as its first chief financial officer. Mr. Blackman previously spent seven years as CFO at Foresee Results Inc., a customer experience \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company that was sold to \uc2 Answers Corp\uc2 . in 2013. Foresee was backed by Updata Partners and Investor Growth Capital before its sale to Answers.\par \par \uc2 Pamlico, which began investing in private equity in 1988, spun out of its former corporate parent, \uc2 Wachovia\uc2 , in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160629ec6t004bp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Britain's decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  could benefit a group thousands of miles away: U.S. homeowners.\par \par \uc2 Several lenders posted rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages of about 3.5% on Monday, nearing a 3.5-year low, and analysts expect coming reports to show that average U.S. mortgage rates have decreased since {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-projected-to-leave-european-union-1466740486"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the Brexit vote Thursday}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The main reason: Investors have flocked to the safety of U.S. Treasurys, pushing interest rates lower as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/european-markets-remain-pressured-by-brexit-1467013530"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 riskier assets such as stocks tumbled}}}\uc2 . Mortgage rates tend to move up and down with 10-year \uc2 Treasury\uc2  rates, though the relationship isn't perfect.\par \par \uc2 The yield on the 10-year \uc2 Treasury\uc2  note was 1.460% on Tuesday, down from 1.579% before the result of Thursday's vote was announced and 2.273% at the end of 2015, according to \uc2 Tradeweb\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Last Wednesday, the \uc2 Mortgage Bankers Association\uc2  reported that the average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.76%. Housing-market analysts will be watching closely on Wednesday when the MBA releases its next weekly report.\par \par \uc2 If mortgage rates decline, that could be a boon both to prospective home buyers and to homeowners who qualify for refinancing. Refinancing could make sense for many people locked into rates of 4% or higher, according to mortgage experts.\par \par \uc2 Lenders are expecting a miniwave of refinancing in coming weeks. In all, 40% of borrowers have loans with a rate of 4.5% or higher, according to \uc2 CoreLogic Inc\uc2 ., a real-estate \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm, meaning they could save about $90 a month on average by refinancing at 3.5%.\par \par \uc2 Lenders across the country said refinancing applications since Thursday are up between 10% to 40% compared with typical volume this time of year.\par \par \uc2 "Unless we see interest rates tick back up, I think we will see a boomlet" in refinancing activity, said Bob Walters, chief economist at Detroit-based \uc2 Quicken Loans Inc\uc2 ., the country's third-largest mortgage lender. Mr. Walters said Quicken is seeing refinancing applications up 30% to 40% compared with typical volume.\par \par \uc2 Because mortgage rates have been near multidecade lows for the past six years, most borrowers who could refinance already have done so. Those who held back largely did so because their home was still underwater or their credit was poor.\par \par \uc2 But strong home-price growth in the past several months has helped increase the pool of borrowers with equity in their homes who are eligible to refinance. About 13% of homeowners owe more than their home is worth, down from a high of 31% in 2012, according to Zillow, a real-estate research firm.\par \par \uc2 The Brexit vote is expected to usher in a period of economic uncertainty across Europe as companies and investors pause to weigh the impact and seek out safe investments such as government bonds. Economic turbulence could prompt the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  to hold off on raising interest rates until next year, which would likely help keep mortgage rates low, economists said.\par \par \uc2 Economists said major global economic shocks tend to boost refinancing activity because homeowners have learned over the years to expect the possibility that rates will fall. Some economists and executives said they expect the impact will be longer lasting than that of other recent shocks, such as the Greek debt crisis several years ago or the Chinese stock-market tumble last August and this January.\par \par \uc2 "I think this will have some legs on it," said Mr. Walters of Quicken Loans.\par \par \uc2 Scott Eggen, director of capital markets at Dallas-based \uc2 PrimeLending\uc2 , said the number of clients trying to lock in their rates at current levels is up 10% in June from May. He said that if rates remain low, he would expect an even bigger jump in activity.\par \par \uc2 "It will go crazier than it is now, which is very busy," he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Kusisto at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.kusisto@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.kusisto@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 The Property Report\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/06/28/mortgage-rates-how-low-can-they-go/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How Low Could Mortgage Rates Go?}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-vote-roils-real-estate-markets-1467146797"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Real Estate Takes a Hit From Brexit}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-buyers-look-again-at-u-k-property-1467137560"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Some in China Look to London}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/singapores-sovereign-wealth-fund-is-in-talks-to-buy-manufactured-home-owner-1467106203"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 GIC in Talks on U.S. Deal}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/06/28/mortgage-rates-how-low-can-they-go/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How Low Could Mortgage Rates Go?}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160628ec6s009vl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

With its first product, Drive, Anki created "smart" robot car racing, combining elements of video games into a physical set of cars and track, all controlled by a mobile device. Cozmo, which will go on sale later this year, takes inspiration from Hollywood robots such as Star Wars ' R2-D2 and \uc2 Pixar\uc2  animated film Wall-E .\par \par \uc2 The diminutive robot, little bigger than a Matchbox car, is able to recognise faces, compete in tabletop games against human players and learn new tricks via a connected smartphone. It also has an "emotion engine" which Anki says will give it an unpredictable personality, depending on how customers play with it.\par \par \uc2 "When you look at robots in movies - whether that's R2-D2 or Johnny 5 from Short Circuit or Wall-E - they all have a very well-defined personality," says \uc2 Hanns Tappeiner\uc2  , Anki's co-founder and president. "The idea for Cozmo is to create a real-life robotic character the way you would normally only see in movies."\par \par \uc2 Anki will start taking orders for the $179 toy this week before it is released in October.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020160628ec6s0002l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Last year, \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . sold forecasting help to about two-thirds of the banks taking the tests.\par \par \uc2 There are even consultants offering advice on the most economical use of other stress-test consultants.\par \par \uc2 "Kick out the consultants," risk analysis firm Novantas advertised recently, telling banks it can help them cut back.\par \par \uc2 The industry has sprung up because failing the stress tests, which the Fed made mandatory in their current form in 2011, can have grave consequences. Banks that don't pass the test can be limited in their ability to raise dividends or buy back shares.\par \par \uc2 The early versions of the tests helped stem the global financial crisis in 2009 by showing big banks weren't about to collapse. Since then, both regulators and bankers said the exams have made banks such as \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  better able to weather shocks like the British vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One executive said this year's scenario\u8212\'20\'14which included negative interest rates, along with a 10% unemployment rate and a roughly 50% drop in the stock market\u8212\'20\'14helped catch flaws in systems that weren't ready to compute rates below zero.\par \par \uc2 But many question whether the Fed is going overboard. Rob Nichols, president of industry group the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2 , last week called the tests "unrealistically severe" and "unnecessarily opaque." The Fed has made the tests harder to pass each year and surprised banks such as \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  by flunking them for risk-management practices. Hence, the need for heavy spending each round to adapt to the new versions of the tests.\par \par \uc2 Banks are expected to quantify precisely how much money they would lose under the scenarios, a herculean task for firms with global footprints, taking hundreds of mathematical models to predict the behavior of millions of assets. Each loan or investment has unique characteristics a bank must gather, track, check and recheck.\par \par \uc2 Banks generally underinvested in those skills before 2008, one reason they were hit so hard by the downturn.\par \par \uc2 The test submissions include a "narrative" document the size of a thick paperback, describing what the firm has done, accompanied by thousands of pages of documentation. Some banks employ professional writers to pen the narratives' chapters, so the Fed will have fewer questions when it examines the firms.\par \par \uc2 In all, building a stress-test program can cost banks $150 million to $250 million apiece at the start.\par \par \uc2 Financial firms globally will spend $4 billion on stress-test information technology this year, estimates Chartist Research. That is up from $3 billion in 2014 and is expected to increase 15% in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Forecasting models generally range in cost from about $100,000 to more than $1 million, depending on their complexity.\par \par \uc2 "We offer customized and off-the-shelf models to help you calculate the stressed probability of defaults," reads a "Stress Testing Suites" brochure from Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc., a unit of \uc2 Moody's Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The banks taking the Fed exams treat stress-test preparation like its own business line, often paying the executives who lead the effort seven-figure salaries.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., the largest U.S. bank by assets, last year had about 550 people working solely on the Fed stress tests, with more than 2,000 employees contributing indirectly, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 "It's like a whole new department at the bank," said \uc2 Joe Sullivan\uc2 , president of International Market Recruiters, which helps banks fill stress-testing jobs.\par \par \uc2 Stress has become a problem among stress-test employees, who often race to finish the exams before the Fed's deadline. The night before submissions are due, bank employees have had to stay up loading documents onto the Fed's slow-moving website, one of many late nights.\par \par \uc2 The test due date for years was January, notoriously ruining bankers' year-end holidays. In sympathy, the Fed this year changed the tests' due date to April, though one banker pointed out that conflicted with spring breaks instead.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the goal is for banks to scale back this mammoth exercise, for executives to have a kind of "push-button" ability to quickly assess their risk, said Michael Alix, who was a senior executive at Bear Stearns during its near-collapse in 2008 and a former \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York\uc2  official who now advises banks on the tests as financial services consulting risk leader at \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After the tests are submitted, the Fed comes to question banks about them. Consultants aren't allowed in the room.\par \par \uc2 Banks continue to build up their teams.\par \par \uc2 The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://jobs.citi.com/in/mumbai/risk-management/jobid10227050-capital-comprehensive-analysis-review-(ccar)-risk-weighted-assets-(rwa)-forecasting-assistant-vice-president-jobs"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 posting for a Citigroup job}}}\uc2  in Mumbai analyzing the bank's risks there and reporting up to the U.S. parent asks for: "Strong attention to detail, willingness to \u8216\'20\'18roll up sleeves' and produce a polished, high quality, accurate product; tireless work ethic with ability to work well under pressure."\par \par \uc2 Emily Glazer and Sarah Krouse contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ryan Tracy at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ryan.tracy@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ryan.tracy@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160628ec6s00aq9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 If you grew up watching movies like "Star Wars," "Short Circuit" or "WALL-E," you've probably daydreamed of what it'd be like to have a robot sidekick, a machine that genuinely reacts to you, recognizes you and talks back.\par \par \uc2 The team at Anki, a San Francisco startup known for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/09/25/anki-overdrive-review-the-future-of-fun/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 smartphone-controlled toy race cars}}}\uc2 , had the same dream. Their new product isn't a car, it is a friendly robot named Cozmo.\par \par \uc2 Anki announced Monday the addition of $52.5 million in Series D funding to bring the robot to consumers. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  led the round, with participation from \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , \uc2 Index Ventures\uc2  and Two Sigma Ventures. The company has now raised a total of $182.5 million.\par \par \uc2 "The reason we love the robots we see in movies so much is because they don't just respond with the same canned responses, they surprise you," says \uc2 Hanns Tappeiner\uc2 , Anki's president and co-founder. "It's taken years but our technology is finally to a point where we can build a robot with personality\u8212\'20\'14and bring some of the things you see in the movies to real life."\par \par \uc2 Cozmo is cute and palm-sized, and looks a bit like a dump truck with an old tube TV for a head. It moves around on tank-style tracks, and has built-in speakers which play a soundtrack of music that changes based on Cozmo's "emotions" at the time. Anki designed its endearingly goofy moves using the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview-dts?s_tnt=69290:1:0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 same animation software filmmakers use}}}\uc2 , only now the action plays out in real life.\par \par \uc2 Cozmo's smarts and gameplay are reminiscent of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/09/25/anki-overdrive-review-the-future-of-fun/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Anki's Overdrive toy race cars}}}\uc2 , which let users unlock new characters and attributes as they race. Like Overdrive cars, Cozmo has onboard sensors, but its brains are in the smartphone or tablet used for gameplay. The software in the app includes Cozmo's "emotion engine," some \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to handle decision making and computer vision that lets Cozmo know where it is in relation to other objects.\par \par \uc2 Those emotions are key to Cozmo's appeal. When it recognizes a new person, Cozmo is social and curious. When ignored, it gets sad or plays on its own. It is frustrated when it loses games, and celebrates when it wins.\par \par \uc2 "Cozmo never gives you the same reaction twice," Mr. Tappeiner said. "The head movement, the arm movement, the ways his eyes animate on his face, or the inflection of his voice\u8212\'20\'14the combinations change to create personality."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tappeiner says Anki will add more games and even more emotional reaction by the time Cozmo goes on sale for $180 in October.

But {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/treasurys-jacob-lew-brexit-not-developing-into-a-financial-crisis-1467034882"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew}}}\uc2  on Monday offered what passes for consensus reassurance in the wake of the Brexit bombshell, telling CNBC there's "no sense of a financial crisis developing" and "it's been an orderly impact so far."\par \par \uc2 "So far" is the operative phrase. There has been much exhaling since Friday about how the U.K. vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  hasn't become a "Lehman moment." And that is true in the literal sense that markets have functioned much more smoothly since June 24 than after Sept. 15, 2008.\par \par \uc2 But what if this is a \uc2 Bear Stearns\uc2  moment? (The March 2008 collapse seemed to pass without broader repercussions but actually presaged the bigger meltdown of \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  later in the year.) Or the Thai baht moment? (The July 1997 devaluation triggered the Asia crisis-turned-emerging market crisis.) Or the \uc2 Long-Term Capital Management\uc2  moment? (The 1998 hedge-fund blow-up stoked fears of a destructive chain reaction across Wall Street).\par \par \uc2 Maybe the postcrisis regulatory regime has inoculated the system against such contagions, as the optimists argue. Or maybe it's just too soon to know. Here are some signs of strains, echoing earlier crises, to monitor in coming days.\par \par \uc2 Hedge Funds: No major funds have yet reported big losses, and many boasted after the fact that they had learned their lessons from other recent shocks {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-funds-limited-risk-ahead-of-brexit-vote-1467045278"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 to minimize their exposure}}}\uc2 . Perhaps. Or it could just be too soon to know how badly they were hit. \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  issued a note Friday {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/06/27/hedge-funds-bought-european-shares-in-run-up-to-brexit/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 flagging "notable net buying" in European shares}}}\uc2  by the firm's hedge-fund clients ahead of the referendum. \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  reported its hedge-fund clients were holding bullish stakes in emerging markets, which have been hit particularly hard post-Brexit, warning of a "long squeeze."\par \par \uc2 European Banks: "Just a few years ago, Europe's banks managed to stagger out of crisis brought on by the Continent's debt woes," {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-risks-for-european-lenders-1466973158"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 begins one Journal article}}}\uc2 . Brexit "could push them back in"\u8212\'20\'14due to factors from lingering bad debts to renewed fears of a eurozone breakup. Italy's government is worried enough to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/rome-mulls-capital-injection-to-support-italian-banks-after-brexit-shock-1467021718"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 weigh a fresh capital injection}}}\uc2  into its banking system.\par \par \uc2 Emerging Markets: The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-effect-ripples-through-emerging-markets-1467033481"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Brexit rout ricocheted}}}\uc2  from South Africa to Poland to Mexico, as investors fretted, among other things, that the stronger dollar would increase debt burdens as dollar-denominated debt becomes more expensive to service and pay back. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-upends-chinas-plans-for-turmoil-free-summer-1466950552"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 China is particularly vulnerable}}}\uc2  if the gap between the dollar and the yuan expands, raising risks for a destabilizing acceleration of capital outflows. The last big global market shocks, pre-Brexit, came from similar sharp gyrations in China.\par \par \uc2 Policy Impotence: Policy makers have been able to cushion the blow from recent shocks\u8212\'20\'14including the Lehman moment\u8212\'20\'14with aggressive monetary stimulus and big bailouts. But the political and economic hangover from those rescues will make it harder to respond if the next crisis hits soon. One particularly worrisome constraint: The negative interest rates central banks have been forced to adopt actually weaken the banking sector, by pinching margins for lenders.\par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Claudio Borio\uc2 , chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-for-international-settlements-warns-of-risks-to-global-growth-1466937001"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 told the Journal}}}\uc2 : "The room for maneuver has narrowed."\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Treasury\uc2 's \uc2 Jacob Lew\uc2 : Brexit Not Developing into a Financial Crisis\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/treasurys-jacob-lew-brexit-not-developing-into-a-financial-crisis-1467034882"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew}}}\uc2  on Monday said following the U.K.'s decision to exit the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , there doesn't appear to be a financial crisis in the making and that the world's economic systems are working.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lew, in an interview on CNBC, said there is "no sense of a financial crisis developing'' in the aftermath of last week's "Brexit'' vote, and that while there has been market volatility, "it's been an orderly impact so far."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-aftermath-first-thing-we-do-hire-all-the-lawyers-1467036544"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Brexit Aftermath: First Thing We Do, Hire All the Lawyers}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/groundhog-day-for-banks-as-market-winter-extended-1467041191?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Analysis: Groundhog Day for Banks as Market Winter Extended}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/strengthening-currencies-bedevil-central-banks-1467063653"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Currency Woes Rack Central Banks}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-and-china-currency-calculus-just-got-more-complicated-1467021725"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  \u8216\'20\'18Brexit' and China: Currency Calculus Just Got More Complicated }}}\par \par \uc2 Banks Get Reprieve From Brexit Hammering\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-get-reprieve-from-brexit-hammering-1467106689"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.

U.S. companies will be required to start complying with the rules in late 2018, the \uc2 SEC\uc2  said. As many as 755 companies could be affected by the requirements, it said.\par \par \uc2 SEC Drafting Rule Requiring Firms Reveal Board Diversity\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-drafting-rule-requiring-firms-reveal-board-diversity-1467078153"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Investors should have more information}}}\uc2  about how many minorities and women serve on corporate boards, and regulators must intervene to require fuller disclosure, the country's top securities regulator said Monday.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2  said her agency would propose a rule to elicit more information about the diversity of board members. Ms. White, speaking to a conference in San Francisco, said the \uc2 SEC\uc2 's current rules have failed to draw out meaningful information, while the share of minority directors for the largest public companies has "stagnated" at 15% for the past several years.\par \par \uc2 Supreme Court Turns Away Debt Buyer Appeal on Loans Sold by National Banks\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-turns-away-debt-buyer-appeal-on-loans-sold-by-national-banks-1467035137"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Supreme Court's move Monday to turn away}}}\uc2  a banking industry appeal involving New York's interest-rate cap on sold debt has left some lenders and debt buyers with two options: lower their rates or stop lending to riskier borrowers in certain states with usury caps.\par \par \uc2 "For now, this causes a great deal of havoc for all kinds of credit, especially consumer credit," said Robert Jackson, a professor at Columbia Law School who recently co-wrote a study on how state usury caps affect borrowers with low credit scores in light of the case.\par \par \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  Lauds CFPB in Appearance With Elizabeth Warren\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-lauds-cfpb-in-appearance-with-elizabeth-warren-1467072813"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton}}}\uc2 , during an appearance with Sen.

They find that U.S. commercial banks located farther from their regulatory field offices face "significantly higher administrative costs," at a rate of 20% of administrative costs per hour of travel time. Those costs can be mitigated if firms are located in an area with other firms facing the same regulatory regime. Banks that operate in an area with numerous other similar firms benefit from that proximity, which the authors attribute to "information spillovers between firms" that can "limit uncertainty about regulatory expectations."\par \par \uc2 Engagement With Regulators Will Help Fintech Firms Innovate\par \par \uc2 The federal government has begun to actively engage with fintech firms, but more venues for such engagement are needed, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/three-steps-to-stronger-fintech-government-ties-1081664-1.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 writes Ohad Samet in American Banker, a trade publication}}}\uc2 . Mr. Samet\u8212\'20\'14co-founder of TrueAccord, a debt-recovery startup that uses messages targeted to different demographics, among other things, to get debtors to pay up\u8212\'20\'14recommends a "more formal model" for regulator-firm engagement. He refers to creating something along the lines of the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 's "Project Catalyst," which allows firms to schedule appointments to discuss innovation with CFPB officials and runs pilot programs for possible new ideas. These venues for discussion, Mr. Samet writes, should involve regulators seeking feedback on possible regulations or explaining the tangible effects of new rules for particular companies. Established relationships between regulators and the fintech industry will allow companies more leeway to innovate, so they can "run their craziest ideas by agencies to get a sense if these are products that regulators can accept," the author says.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-to-say-au-revoir-tschuss-to-english-language-1467036600"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The U.K.'s departure from the European Union}}}\uc2  will erode the status of the English language in \uc2 EU\uc2  institutions to the benefit of French and German, with the bloc's executive arm already moving to ditch English from some of its official communications.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/accounting-choices-blur-profit-picture-1467086625"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Just 29 companies in the S&P 500 index}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14or 5.7% of the total\u8212\'20\'14closed their books for 2015 exclusively using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.

This is where algorithms are used to suggest funds to investors, replacing some human financial advisers in the process.\par \par \uc2 Less spoken about is the impact robotics and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  could have on the role of the portfolio manager. But commentators believe many fund managers' jobs could come under threat as developments are made in technology.\par \par \uc2 "\b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  can replace stock pickers in many funds," says Alexey Utkin, who leads the UK financial services practice at \uc2 DataArt\uc2 , the technology consultancy. "Why employ hundreds of asset managers, each selecting stocks and implementing investment strategies, when a few programs can do it for you?"\par \par \uc2 Sudhir Nanda , head of the quantitative management arm at T Rowe Price, the US asset manager, told the FT earlier this year: "Humans aren't going to be completely replaced [in fund management], but they will be mostly replaced."\par \par \uc2 In the UK, the Investment Association, the trade body, estimates there are 6,700 individuals employed in asset allocation and stock selection. If robots replaced just 15 per cent of these, there would be 1,000 fewer staff in fund management roles.\par \par \uc2 Any shift towards robot stock pickers, which lack the human emotions that can drive portfolio managers to make rash investment decisions, would be a huge change for an industry that sells itself as a "people business".\par \par \uc2 Analysts believe it would mean lower costs for investors and larger profits for asset managers, because it would end one of the industry's biggest expenses: salaries.\par \par \uc2 This shift away from human fund managers is not some far-flung dream that will happen decades into the future, adds Mr Utkin. "Within the next two years I expect to see more and more examples of AI-led investing. Within the next five years this could very well become the standard," he says.\par \par \uc2 Matt Thomas, a partner at \uc2 KPMG\uc2 , the professional services firm, agrees: "We could see, in five years' time, a relatively automatic process [when it comes to fund management], bringing together data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , stock picking, quantitative investment decisions and automatic trading."\par \par \uc2 Increased competition from robots could not come at a worse time for the active fund industry, which is already facing criticism for poor performance. According to research by S&P Dow Jones, the index provider, almost every actively managed equity fund in Europe that invests in global, emerging and US markets has failed to beat its benchmark over the past decade.\par \par \uc2 Concerns about performance have prompted some investors to shun active funds in favour of cheaper passive products, where funds track an index, or smart-beta funds , a halfway house between active and passive management.\par \par \uc2 The rise of the passive market has meant investors are increasingly used to investing in funds without a high-profile portfolio manager, making the shift to investing in funds run by computers less daunting.\par \par \uc2 Active managers are now grappling with how to respond to this change. Michelle Seitz, head of William Blair Investment Management, the $64bn US fund house, says robots could "partially" replace portfolio managers.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think we should be afraid of [\b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 ]. The answer is we should embrace change. If \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  is part of delivering great value to a client over time, then the answer is we will figure out a higher and better use for what it is we do," she says.\par \par \uc2 Parts of the fund industry have a history of embracing technology. In a quantitative, or quant, fund, investment houses build computer-based models to determine whether an investment is attractive or not.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, the computer also makes the final decision on buying or selling a stock, in the belief that if technology can beat world champion chess players, it should also be able to beat the market.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, this thesis has been proved in some quant hedge funds, which have outperformed their highly paid human counterparts during volatile markets.\par \par \uc2 Fund managers have also started to incorporate \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the analysis of vast amounts of data by computers, into their investment processes. The hope is this will allow them to discover information about potential investment opportunities.\par \par \uc2 It seems likely that humans will face much tougher competition from machines, which can both source investment ideas from \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and decide when to make investment decisions without emotional interference.\par \par \uc2 The shift towards \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  is expected to have a mixed impact on asset managers. Dean Ungar, senior analyst at Moody's, the rating agency, says: "Getting rid of staff would be a plus for profit margins, but offset by fee compression."\par \par \uc2 Ben Phillips, a partner at Casey Quirk, the consultancy, adds that while humans will still be necessary to monitor and program automated technology, far fewer individuals will be needed to oversee each fund.\par \par \uc2 Instead of having two portfolio managers on a single fund, for instance, one individual could oversee 10 funds. "The scalability is much higher. These portfolio managers [that are backed by \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 ] can run a lot more money," he says.\par \par \uc2 But building strong \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology is expensive. Mr Utkin says: "With the relatively high cost of running and advancing AI, we may see certain players losing the competition and disappearing."\par \par \uc2 Active managers are now weighing up how they can use the technology to their advantage. \uc2 Kai Sotorp\uc2 , chief executive of Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $325bn, says the Canadian company is looking "very carefully" at how it can use technology, especially \b \highlight22\uc2 big data analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , within its investment funds.\par \par \uc2 But he believes humans will continue to play an important role in active fund management. "It doesn't matter what is out there. Judgment, skill and expertise is always going to be necessary and I don't think you can put all that into an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  solution," he says.\par \par \uc2 "You can definitely gain tremendous benefit from \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and its development. That will be complementary with active managers. I don't think one necessary replaces the other."\par \par \uc2 Mr Ungar agrees: "Humans add experience. \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  clearly is going to be incorporated more and more into [fund managers'] decision processes. But at the same time, humans still have experience, judgment and creativity that may not exist within the AI world."\par \par \uc2 The fund managers who closely follow their benchmarks are most at risk of losing out to robots, according to Mr Philips.\par \par \uc2 "People who say robots will wipe out human stock pickers are wrong. What they will wipe out is bad stock pickers," he says.\par \par \uc2 Joe Sullivan, chief executive of Legg Mason, the US fund house, agrees: "There is not a simple answer to whether technology will replace human capabilities. If individuals perform, they will get good flows [from investors]. If they don't, they will lose."\par \par \uc2 Warning from literature\par \par \uc2 Rely on machines - and things go wrong\par \par \uc2 When investment funds rely on machines, things go wrong. Or at least that is the premise behind Robert Harris's novel, The Fear Index.\par \par \uc2 In the 2011 book, a hedge fund creates a system called VIXAL-4, which uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to trade on fear. It anticipates flights from stocks before human traders retreat.\par \par \uc2 But then the machine appears to move beyond the control of its human creators, wreaking havoc in the process.\par \par \uc2 The risks of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  within finance might not be as great as that espoused by The Fear Index, but that does not mean there are not concerns about the increasing use of machines in investment management.\par \par \uc2 Alexey Utkin, financial services practice lead for the UK at \uc2 DataArt\uc2 , the technology consultancy, says the growth of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  in investment products brings both rewards and risks for investors.\par \par \uc2 "It may change the market structure, bringing more centralisation and other systemic risks, leading to greater volatility," says Mr Utkin.\par \par \uc2 He gives the example of currency trading, where rather than hundreds of foreign exchange traders selecting which currencies to trade and at what price, a few algorithms could dominate the market in future.\par \par \uc2 "This kind of centralisation within markets often leads to greater risk and higher volatility," he says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160627ec6r00008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

He was also appointed chairman of Lancashire Holdings, the reinsurer, in February, and is a member of the treasury committee of \uc2 King's College London\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Dan Mannix\uc2 , chief executive of RWC, which experienced a 40 per cent rise in its assets last year, to $11.5bn, said the board appointment reflected the company\u8217\'20\'19s ambition to win business from large institutional clients in the US, Asia, Australia and Europe.\par \par \uc2 He said: \u8220\'20\'1CWe are in growth mode. We wanted to ensure we have experienced people around who are very well regarded by clients, are known to various regulators, and can help us in our strategic decision making.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Clarke, who stepped down from \uc2 Man Group\uc2  in 2013 after it suffered a significant fall in its share price and assets under management, added that his knowledge of the fintech industry would prove valuable to RWC.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Mr Clarke joined the board of Essentia \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a fintech business that uses psychology software to help traders at fund companies \u8212\'20\'14 including \uc2 Man Group\uc2  and Artemis \u8212\'20\'14 analyse the link between their sleeping patterns and investment performance.\par \par \uc2 Mr Clarke said: \u8220\'20\'1C[RWC] wants to show it is going places and is solid, sustainable and of institutional quality. They are conscious they need to build out the board to reflect that ambition.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 RWC also wants underline its independence from \uc2 Schroders\uc2 , the UK\u8217\'20\'19s largest listed fund company, which has a 43 per cent stake in RWC, by adding an independent director to the board for the first time, according to Mr Clarke.\par \par \uc2 The remaining board members are Gemma Bainbridge (chairman), finance director at RWC; Paul Larche, chief operating officer; John Innes, the first fund manager at RWC; Nicky Richards, head of equities at \uc2 Schroders\uc2 ; Roger Goodchild, head of corporate development at \uc2 Schroders\uc2 ; and Mr Mannix.\par \par \uc2 The chief executive said Mr Clarke\u8217\'20\'19s long history in the industry will be particularly useful at a time when asset management is struggling with volatile markets and heavy outflows.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor all of us 2016 has been a difficult start to the year, and we have had some outflows. UK fund flows were at their lowest level in the first quarter of 2015 in 15 years, and that is reflected across Europe\u8217\'20\'19s fund industry,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020160626ec6q0008h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

"The question is how negative is the news."\par \par \uc2 Although many observers tried to play down some of the gloom-and-doom predictions that have rippled around the world, venture capitalists widely frowned on the historic referendum as bad for business and bad for the future of startup opportunities, especially in Britain.\par \par \uc2 Anxiety about Thursday's "Brexit" vote centers on the countless questions and uncertainty surrounding what to expect in watching a nation break away from the \uc2 EU\uc2 , an event without precedent.\par \par \uc2 How Britain negotiates terms of its exit, a process that could take at least two years, could have far-reaching consequences since the U.K. accounts for about one-third of Europe's venture capital fundings.\par \par \uc2 For decades, London has benefited from its dual role as the de facto banking capital and primary hub for entrepreneurship in Europe, identities that flourished under the \uc2 EU\uc2 's charter of free movement of goods, capital and migration. Several startup watchers and investors said much of that could be lost by leaving the 28-member union.\par \par \uc2 Britain's departure represents "a devastating blow" to the momentum the nation's startup scene has enjoyed in recent years, said \uc2 Kristian Segerstrale\uc2 , a co-founder of the social-game company Playfish who is now an investor with Initial Capital in London and Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 "Talent may be barred from entering in the future, but already now the writing is on the wall," Mr. Segerstrale said via email. "Should you as a top-of-your-field [\b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 ] researcher from Italy move to Berlin, Helsinki, Silicon Valley or London to pursue your startup? London will seem a lot less interesting now."\par \par \uc2 On the day after the vote, President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  coincidentally addressed an entrepreneurship conference of venture capitalists and startup founders at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 . Speaking to the group, he pointed to the referendum as a reminder of the challenge facing innovators in a world ever changing from globalization.\par \par \uc2 "The world has shrunk, it's interconnected, and all of you represent these interconnections," Mr. Obama said. "Many of you are catalyzing and accelerating it. It promises to bring extraordinary benefits, but also challenges, concerns and fears."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Nelis of \uc2 Accel Partners\uc2 , which just closed a $500 million fund in April to target investments in Europe and Israel, is looking to invest in startups that have very strong reasons to exist, and even though the vote a step back, "it won't kill any of those companies."\par \par \uc2 Dan Ciporin\uc2 , general partner at \uc2 Canaan Partners\uc2 , who invests in fintech companies, said the vote will "definitely impact European startups, and fintechs specifically. London has been the center of fintech innovation in Europe, and that is now clearly threatened by the Brexit vote."\par \par \uc2 One of the big losers in the aftermath, Mr. Ciporin said, will be London's long renown as a beachhead for foreign companies making inroads into continental Europe.\par \par \uc2 "I think the impact on U.S. startups...is less clear, although certainly it will mean that any decision to put in place a European HQ will be driven much more towards the continent rather than London," he said. "For fintech, this will probably be a boon to Stockholm in particular, which was probably second to London as a fintech innovation center."\par \par \uc2 Tim Wilson\uc2 , a partner with \uc2 Artiman Ventures\uc2  who specializes in early-stage investing, said the vote makes investors more likely to stay away from U.K. opportunities because of the shadow of uncertainty hanging over the issue.\par \par \uc2 "When I'm comfortable, and I feel like I know the future, then I make different decisions than if I feel like I'm uncertain, and I'm not sure where this goes."\par \par \uc2 One of the companies he invested in, Prysm, is based in San Jose, Calif., but has an office in London, where it sells a video technology priced in dollars. With the British pound tumbling on foreign exchanges, Prysm's sales staff faces a fresh hurdle because their product just got much more expensive for buyers in the U.K., Mr. Wilson said.\par \par \uc2 Mavra Bari, a British national from Pakistan who was attending the Stanford summit, said she was born in the U.K. because her parents were refugees and were granted asylum.\par \par \uc2 "I owe a lot to the U.K.," she said. But she called the Brexit vote "a historically idiotic move."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Yuliya Chernova, Tomio Geron, Deborah Gage and Patience Haggin contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160625ec6p000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Even regional, U.S. focused banks, such as U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc., were hit due to fears that even lower interest rates could pressure profits further.\par \par \uc2 The drubbing followed what had been a tense night for many bankers.

He added that he had been in touch with Chief Executive \uc2 James Dimon\uc2  several times through the night.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  , Chief Executive \uc2 Michael Corbat\uc2  stayed up until about 11:30 p.m. Thursday watching the results come in, according to a person familiar with the matter. He slept for an hour and a half before getting on the phone at 1 a.m. with other executives. He slept again for an hour at 4 a.m., before arriving at the office at 6 a.m. Friday.\par \par \uc2 Underscoring the situation's severity, the Fed's point person on regulation, Governor \uc2 Daniel Tarullo\uc2  called the heads of several large U.S. financial institutions Friday to gauge how those firms and markets were faring, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Like other financial firms, \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  is still assessing what the Brexit vote means. The bank employs around 16,000 people in the U.K. At \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  , top executives wrote a memorandum to employees Friday to quell rumors that it would move employees from its U.K. offices.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the big U.S. banks' direct exposures to Europe, \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2  . got around 26% of its 2015 revenue from the continent, more than any of its peers, according to analysts at \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2  . In terms of balance-sheet risk, \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  had around $144 billion in loans, securities and other exposure to countries in the \uc2 EU\uc2  at the end of the first quarter, with around 35% of that in the U.K., according to a securities filing.\par \par \uc2 For European banks, the potential outcomes are bleakest. \u8220\'20\'1CI'm afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe," Deutsche Bank Chief Executive \uc2 John Cryan\uc2  said in a statement. \u8220\'20\'1CAt this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there's no doubt that they will be negative on all sides."\par \par \uc2 Europe's banks were already retrenching before the vote and markets remain fearful many don't have thick enough capital buffers. Even before the vote, shares were valued at levels that signaled distress; \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  trades at just 30% of its book value, or net worth.\par \par \uc2 Contributing to the woes of European banks is an anemic economic backdrop despite extraordinary stimulus measures from the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  that have included buying bonds and the introduction of negative rates for some deposits banks keep with the central bank.\par \par \uc2 One big question for U.S. banks is how any further economic and market disruption in Europe will affect already subpar U.S. growth. Worrying, even if it doesn't ding the economy too much, market and political turmoil could keep the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  from raising interest rates further.\par \par \uc2 That means banks could continue to labor under superlow rates, which weigh on profits. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, for example, fell to 1.57% Friday from 1.74% before the U.K. decision Thursday.\par \par \uc2 But while bank stocks were battered, credit markets weren't panicking. The cost of insuring big, U.S. banks against default jumped Friday, but remained low compared with the cost during market turmoil a few years ago. Bank executives in London said there was no pressure on interbank funding, which is crucial to keep financial markets functioning.\par \par \uc2 What's more, there weren't visible signs Friday of bank distress. That is a difference between today and 2008, according to Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of research firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe reason is market confidence in the resilience of the largest U.S. and U.K. banks\u8212\'20\'14this time, counterparties know they can count on these banks for the funding that is their lifeblood," she wrote in a note Friday. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat's going on now is ugly, but not cataclysmic."\par \par \uc2 Peter Rudegeair and Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160624ec6o00b9l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 ., fared particularly well, with their capital ratios -- a key measure of financial strength -- increasing briskly from levels seen during last year's drill and comfortably exceeding the level that the regulator views as a minimum.\par \par \uc2 A senior Fed official, in a conference call with reporters, noted the broad improvement banks had made in recent years, saying they entered this year's exam with more capital and higher-quality loans. They also benefited as the heavy legal costs from their role in the financial crisis recede.\par \par \uc2 Next week, the Fed will release the second part of the tests, which include regulators' decisions on whether to allow or block banks' plans to return capital to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks.\par \par \uc2 Thursday's results don't necessarily predict the Fed's verdict next week, since in the second round the Fed judges banks not just by their balance sheets, but by how officials assess banks' risk-management practices.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the Fed calculated that 33 of the largest U.S. banks would have loan losses of $385 billion under a hypothetical scenario that envisions the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubling to 10%, the stock market losing half its value and financial markets becoming so topsy-turvy that short-term \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  rates turn negative as investors pay the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  to hold their money. Even with those big losses, they would still have enough capital to satisfy regulators, the Fed said.\par \par \uc2 This year's exams were "arguably the most stressful stress tests yet," said Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Chief Economist Mark Zandi in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Big bank shares added to their gains of the day in after-hours trading after the results were released, with shares of the biggest six U.S. banks -- \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 , \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  -- rising between 0.3% and 2.2%.\par \par \uc2 The stress tests were created during the financial crisis and helped in 2009 to convince panicky investors that big banks weren't on the brink of collapse. Congress in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law made annual stress tests mandatory, and the Fed has adopted its own rules tying shareholder dividends to the tests.\par \par \uc2 The goal is to force banks to manage their finances in a way that they would be able to keep lending during the worst economic conditions and to diminish the risk of big bank failures.\par \par \uc2 The stress tests are just one of several new drills that regulators have been running with banks to prevent a new crisis.\par \par \uc2 They also have to file annual "living wills" which show how -- if all of those other defenses collapse and the banks find themselves on the brink of bankruptcy -- they could be unwound without an infusion of taxpayer funds or without traumatizing the broader financial system.\par \par \uc2 Despite Thursday's results, Fed officials say they are going to force the very largest banks to maintain even more capital, in part because stress tests won't necessarily anticipate the source of the next crisis.\par \par \uc2 Critics say the Fed programs are overkill, going to extremes to prevent a crisis while hampering the economy's ability to recover from the last one.\par \par \uc2 "I think the Fed is trying to make these entities fail-proof; I think it's kind of spilling over the entire financial community," Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R., Texas) told Fed Chairwoman \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  during a congressional hearing Wednesday. "We've got economists trying to run banks," he added, blaming that for "anemic growth."\par \par \uc2 The stress tests "will make you very safe," Bank of America Corp. CEO \uc2 Brian Moynihan\uc2  told a Wall Street Journal conference last week. "The question is whether it restricts lending."\par \par \uc2 Fed defenders say the tests have made banks stronger, and stronger banks make more loans than weaker ones.\par \par \uc2 This is the second year in a row in which all the banks taking the tests maintained capital levels above what the Fed views as a minimum allowance. The Fed said the banks collectively maintained at least 8.4% high-quality capital as a share of assets, staying well above the Fed's 4.5% minimum even after being pounded by a severe economic downturn. That was also better than the 7.6% in high-quality capital they maintained in last year's test. The banks collectively started this round of tests with 12.3% capital at the end of 2015.\par \par \uc2 The Fed says banks have more than doubled their capital since 2009, boosting common equity by more than $700 billion.\par \par \uc2 The Fed changes the details of its recession scenarios from year to year, so the specifics can hit one type of bank harder than another. Relative to last year, this year's negative-rate scenario took a tougher toll on traditional banking businesses that rely on deposits as a source of funding, the senior Fed official said. That was a contrast from last year, when large trading banks were harder hit than in the past because the Fed in that scenario assumed significant corporate defaults. The low-rates scenario also helped to boost trading revenue for the biggest banks by limiting stock-price declines and market volatility, the Fed official said.\par \par \uc2 This led all six of the biggest U.S. banks to show higher predicted net revenue before credit losses in the test. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 's predicted revenue more than doubled compared with last year's exam, and that of \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  quintupled. That, along with a higher starting point for their capital bases, helped all six post minimum capital levels in the test that were higher than those registered in last year's exams.\par \par \uc2 In addition to running the stress tests on their current balance sheets, the banks have also submitted to the Fed their desired plans to return capital to investors, making the case that they could pass the test even after making those payouts.\par \par \uc2 If the firms determine, based on Thursday's results, that their capital plans would push them below the Fed's minimum required threshold, they have until Saturday to take a one-time shot at a "mulligan" -- cutting their request for dividends or buybacks to stay above the Fed's minimum requirement.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Christina Rexrode and Emily Glazer contributed to this article.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich264\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal5240\pichgoal5280

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14An event Thursday aimed at exploring how policy makers should oversee financial technology is set to be the scene of a rarity: financial-services firms asking for more regulation.\par \par \uc2 The national bank regulator, the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , is hosting the daylong public forum at its Washington headquarters to review comments it received the past few months in response to a report on overseeing fintech.\par \par \uc2 Many of the 60 comment letters submitted were paradoxical to the banking industry, which has long argued it is overburdened with regulation. Many of the commenters\u8212\'20\'14including executives at banks such as \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . and online lenders like \uc2 LendingClub Corp\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14were {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/fintech-startup-craves-more-regulation-1465517775"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 largely in favor of further regulation}}}\uc2  in the hope that it would provide clarity on how they can develop new technology or form partnerships between banks and fintech firms.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFocus on making regulatory expectations very clear, and coordinated with other regulatory agencies," wrote \uc2 Richard Neiman\uc2 , head of regulatory and government affairs at \uc2 LendingClub\uc2 , the largest online lender.\par \par \uc2 LendingClub\uc2  has partnerships with dozens of large and small banks but Mr. Neiman said many of those banks perceive \u8220\'20\'1Cregulators have not been clear in their expectations" of such partnerships. \u8220\'20\'1CThis perception of unclear regulatory expectations prevents many banks from moving forward with platform arrangements, and forgoing the benefits they offer," he said.\par \par \uc2 Heather Cox\uc2 , the chief of Citi's fintech operation, said it would be \u8220\'20\'1Cinvaluable" to have further guidance on how banks should oversee their third-party partners that are new or not a part of the bank's core function, such as new data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  of borrowers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs we seek to provide relevant offers and new services to consumers, we perform exhaustive reviews of new data sources and models to insure that we treat consumers fairly and do not disadvantage any of our diverse communities," Ms. Cox wrote. \u8220\'20\'1CImproved guidance on the level of due diligence and required documentation would assist in testing and implementing new programs."\par \par \uc2 Consumer advocates also supported {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-see-risks-in-online-lending-technology-behind-digital-currencies-1466549690"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 further regulation in fintech}}}\uc2  but took a more hard-line stance by cautioning the \uc2 OCC\uc2  that some fintech firms can team up with a national bank, which exempts them from certain state laws, for instance those including interest-rate caps for consumer loans. Many consumer groups also oppose an \uc2 OCC\uc2  idea to create a federal charter for fintech firms. A federal charter would help such firms avoid having to go state-by-state for licensing, but it could also give them pre-emption from certain state laws.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPartnerships should not be used to evade state consumer protection laws, and we oppose a federal charter for fintech companies," wrote \uc2 Lauren Saunders\uc2 , associate director of the \uc2 National Consumer Law Center\uc2 , slated to be a panelist at the \uc2 OCC\uc2  forum. \u8220\'20\'1CFintech companies also need to be supervised directly, in addition to the indirect supervision they may receive through bank regulators."\par \par \uc2 Not every commenter agreed with further regulation. In an interesting twist, Meredith Fuchs\u8212\'20\'14who recently left a post as acting deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to join \uc2 Capital One Financial\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14said the \uc2 OCC\uc2 's existing guidance on third-party oversight and risk management was enough.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGiven the significant risk management progress made by the banking industry, we do not believe that any additional \uc2 OCC\uc2  regulations or formal guidelines are necessary to further define or enhance the concept of \u8216\'20\'18responsible innovation,' " said Ms. Fuchs, senior vice president and chief counsel on regulatory issues at \uc2 Capital One\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Instead, Ms. Fuchs said the \uc2 OCC\uc2  should take a \u8220\'20\'1Cprinciples-based" approach on fintech supervision rather than using \u8220\'20\'1Cone-size-fits-all regulations."\par \par \uc2 Write to Rachel Witkowski at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:rachel.witkowski@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rachel.witkowski@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160623ec6n003h2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

The ranks of subprime borrowers swelled during the financial crisis, peaking at 25.5% in 2010, as mortgage payments, credit-card bills and other debts went unpaid.\par \par \uc2 The improving trend could bring relief to big banks, which tightened credit standards in the wake of the crisis. An increase in more-creditworthy borrowers could allow them to increase lending without lowering standards. Banks are desperate for revenue growth since the same superlow rates helping borrowers are also squeezing their own profits.\par \par \uc2 "It will have a positive impact on loan volume, loan growth and revenue," Morgan Whitacre, a consumer client underwriting executive at \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 ., said. Credit-card and auto lending would be the first areas to benefit.\par \par \uc2 This, in turn, could bolster consumer spending and the U.S. economy. As more people gain access to credit, consumer spending in the short term should rise, said Rob Martin, U.S. economist at Barclays PLC. "It frees people from having to spend only the cash they have on hand," he said.\par \par \uc2 "It's good for the economy in the sense that there's a lot less risk in the credit that's extended," he added.\par \par \uc2 In some ways, the improvement is natural as the housing downturn and financial crisis fade further into the past. After a set number of years, foreclosures or missed debt payments drop off consumers' credit reports, helping increase their scores and expanding their access to financing. This is particularly true for subprime borrowers, or those whose FICO credit scores range from 300 to 599 on a scale that tops out at 850.\par \par \uc2 There are other factors at work: The economy has recovered since the financial crisis and the unemployment rate, at 4.7%, is less than half of its late-2009 peak. Wage growth of around 2% isn't as high as the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  would like, but it is still providing consumers with more firepower.\par \par \uc2 Superlow interest rates have played a big role. Monthly debt-service payments accounted for 10.07% of households' disposable personal income at the end of last year, down from a peak of 13.21% at the end of 2007, according to Fed data. Low interest rates, which have lessened required monthly payments for many borrowers, have helped bring this figure down.\par \par \uc2 Many borrowers have also been paying down credit-card debt, a move that can help increase their credit scores. Martha Souder, an administrative assistant in Silver Spring, Md., says she currently has a credit score of about 712. That is up sharply from around545 in 2012, when she had roughly $50,000 in debt spread between 25 to 30 credit cards, many of which were maxed out.\par \par \uc2 "I have suffered a really long time, and it was a crushing burden," she said. Her goal is to buy a house in coming years.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, as credit scores are rising, defaults are near record lows. Some 0.81% of consumer-loan dollars -- including mortgages, auto loans and general-purpose credit cards -- were in default as of May, the lowest level in records going back to 2004, according to the S&P/Experian Consumer Credit Default Composite Index. This is down from 0.88% a year ago and a peak of 5.51% in May 2009. Much of that improvement is due to plummeting mortgage defaults in recent years.\par \par \uc2 "People are putting those delinquencies further and further in the rearview mirror," said Ethan Dornhelm, senior director of scores and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  at FICO.\par \par \uc2 Borrowers also are managing their debt more responsibly, with fewer incidences of defaults and collections. Some 11.8% of borrowers were 90 days or more past due on at least one debt obligation during the 12 months through April, down from 13.3% during the 12 months through October 2013, according to FICO.\par \par \uc2 Already, consumers are starting to borrow more again. Auto-loan balances surpassed $1 trillion for the first time ever this year, according to credit-reporting firm \uc2 Experian\uc2 . Credit-card debt is on pace to hit $1 trillion this year. Student-loan debt continues to swell.\par \par \uc2 That does raise some concerns. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief \uc2 James Dimon\uc2  earlier this month called the auto-lending market "a little stretched." And \uc2 Synchrony Financial\uc2 , the largest U.S. retail-store card issuer by purchase volume and balances, recently increased its forecast for credit losses forthe next 12 months. Separately, May marked the fifth consecutive month of higher defaults for general-purpose credit cards.\par \par \uc2 Still, consumer-loan default levels remain at historically low levels. In addition, household balance sheets have gone through years of postcrisis repair. U.S. household debt was equal to 102% of disposable income at the end of the first quarter, Fed data show, down markedly from a peak of about 130% in late 2007.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160623000100"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160623ec6n0002q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The mobile ad company Verve, which helps marketers target people with ads using location data, is acquiring Roximity Inc., a Denver-based startup that manages a network of beacons in stores across the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Verve recently raised $30 million in debt financing through its partnership with \uc2 Silicon Valley Bank\uc2  . Some of that new funding will be used to pay for Roximity, said Verve Chief Executive \uc2 Nada Stirratt\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Roximity's investors included \uc2 Fenox Venture Capital\uc2  , Fraser McCombs Capital and \uc2 Ludlow Ventures\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.\par \par \uc2 The 11-year-old Verve provides software and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to 25,000 mobile apps and websites, such as apps like WeatherBug and a range of local news and information websites owned by media companies including \uc2 Meredith Corp\uc2  . and Gannett's Co.'s \uc2 USA Today\uc2  . Verve sells ads for 40,000 mobile publishers overall.\par \par \uc2 The company is able to collect first-party location data on 30 million devices from these relationships, which it then uses to deliver targeted mobile ads.\par \par \uc2 Now, the plan is to take that location data and connect it with Roximity's beacon data culled from 35,000 store locations (such as \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  ) to start helping marketers gauge whether mobile ads spur visits to stores.\par \par \uc2 More retailers are placing beacons\u8212\'20\'14small pieces of hardware\u8212\'20\'14in their stores in the U.S. These retailers, in partnership with beacon providers, can track when people enter stores and, in some cases, even when they visit specific aisles. Companies like Apple have been investing in this area.\par \par \uc2 Beacons like Roximity's product emit a unique Bluetooth signal. In this case, as long as a person has installed an app on their phone that Verve's software is connected to and they've opted in to allow that app to use their location, a beacon can ping their phone. Roximity can use that beacon signal to determine where a person's phone is\u8212\'20\'14near a store's entrance or in a particular aisle. The beacon devices only work when a person is nearby, and they don't know exactly who the individual is.\par \par \uc2 Tom Kenney\uc2  , Verve's chief innovation officer and co-founder, said the combination of the two companies' technologies should prove more powerful than typical data pulled from just mobile devices.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGPS is good," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut it is sometimes not great. The best and most accurate data comes from beacons." As a result of the deal and Roximity's partnerships with retailers, Verve should have access to direct, first-party data from over 50 million mobile devices, he said.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with CMO Today at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Ms. Stirratt said that for too long, when it comes to mobile location data, the ad industry has focused on the idea of beaming someone a coupon when they walk past a \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  . That sort of tactic is a smaller part of Verve's business.\par \par \uc2 The bigger opportunity is using a person's anonymously collected location history to serve that person an ad at a later time, Ms. Stirratt said. And with Roximity's data, Verve should be able to better prove that location-based advertising drives results, she said. \u8220\'20\'1CBrands want to see this is working, and attribution is a big deal," she said.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Roximity has beacons installed in \uc2 National CineMedia\uc2  movie theaters. Instead of delivering an ad to a moviegoer when they are already headed to the latest blockbuster and have probably made up their mind about what they want to see, Verve can use Roximity's data to put together a collection of anonymous mobile phone users who have visited certain theaters multiple times over a given period and send those people ads at a later date for the next big summer movie on the calendar.\par \par \uc2 According to Ms. Stirratt, Verve is profitable and has grown revenue by 50% over the past four years.\par \par \uc2 In addition to pushing into beacon technology, Ms. Stirratt said that Verve is starting a new initiative aimed at creating better, more mobile-appropriate ad units, including an ad that people will be able to save on their phones and respond to later so as not to interrupt their mobile content experiences.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160622ec6m005mw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Profits at banks are under pressure from spiralling regulatory costs and low interest rates, while faster and cheaper computing power is allowing outsiders to handle vast quantities of data far more easily.\par \par \uc2 Venture capital-backed fintech companies raised $14.4bn of financing last year - almost double the previous year - according to a report from \uc2 KPMG International\uc2  and CB Insights.\par \par \uc2 "The future exchange and market infrastructure organisation will have a larger responsibility in fostering growth and innovation throughout financial markets," said \uc2 Carsten Kengeter\uc2  , \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 's chief executive. "Technology is at the core of our business, so partnering with innovative fintech firms that are relevant for our clients is an absolute priority for us."\par \par \uc2 Rivals have also encouraged innovation in financial markets, following a path taken two years ago by \uc2 CME Group\uc2 . \uc2 ICAP\uc2 , the interdealer broker, will also make venture capital investments a significant part of its growth when it becomes NEX Group .\par \par \uc2 The fund will focus on areas such as market operator infrastructure, digitisation of post-trade services and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The move will be "formalising and institutionalising investing within \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 ", said Ankur Kamalia, head of venture portfolio management at the exchange, and responsible for DB1 Ventures. "It's not a fintech fund that will invest randomly. It will invest only in areas that are strategic to \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 ," he added.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 's investments include minority stakes in fixed-income platforms Digital Vega and GMEX , and a venture to trade capacity for cloud computing, as well as a trade repository it runs with Spain's Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u241\'00\'F1oles (BME).\par \par \uc2 However, since Mr Kengeter's arrival, it has started to rejig its portfolio, selling off a 50 per cent stake in Infobolsa, a data provider, to BME for \u8364\'20\'AC8.2m.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160622ec6m0002p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 S\u195\'00\'C3O PAULO\u8212\'20\'14Shares of Brazil's largest bank took a hit Tuesday, a day after telephone company \uc2 Oi SA{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/telecom-oi-files-largest-bankruptcy-request-in-brazils-history-1466463734"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 filed the nation's largest request ever for bankruptcy protection}}}\uc2  and raised the likelihood of steep losses for creditors owed nearly $19 billion by the troubled carrier.\par \par \uc2 State-controlled Banco do Brasil SA, the country's biggest bank by assets, finished down 4.5%. Oi's shares fell 18%.\par \par \uc2 Private-sector lenders \uc2 Itau Unibanco Holding SA\uc2  and \uc2 Banco Bradesco SA\uc2  opened lower, then recovered over the course of the day. Itau ended at 29.39 reais, from 29.40 on Monday, after falling as much as 2.6% during the day, and \uc2 Banco Bradesco SA\uc2  fell as much as 1.8% before turning positive before the close of trading.\par \par \uc2 Oi's debt to \uc2 Banco do Brasil\uc2  is estimated at more than 5 billion Brazilian reais, while Itau and \uc2 Bradesco\uc2  are said to be owed some 1.5 billion reais each by the telecommunications company, according to Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Pedro Brugger, an analyst at investment company Leme Investimentos. The three banks declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 At the end of March, about one-quarter of the roughly 50 billion reais ($14.75 billion) Oi owed to lenders was in the hands of commercial banks. Oi owes billions more to Brazil's tax agency, the country's telecoms regulator and others. Monday's filing by Oi and six subsidiaries lists 65.4 billion reais ($19.26 billion) in total debt.\par \par \uc2 A brutal recession has sent bankruptcy filings soaring in Brazil, forcing banks to boost their reserves. Oi\u180\'00\'B4s bankruptcy protection request will further weigh on the financial sector, said Luis Miguel Santacreu, an analyst with credit-ratings firm Austin Rating.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis happens at a difficult time [for Brazil] and requests for bankruptcy protection will probably continue to increase," he said.\par \par \uc2 Oi's shares were suspended several times on Tuesday as the price of its preferred shares plunged as much as 30% soon after they started trading. The shares fell as much as 31% during the day and closed down 18.2%, while the benchmark Ibovespa index finished up 1%.\par \par \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2 , \uc2 Standard & Poor's\uc2  and \uc2 Moody's Investors Service\uc2  all said Tuesday they downgraded their ratings for Oi. Fitch, which had downgraded Oi just last Friday as well, cited the phone company's \u8220\'20\'1Cdebt-laden precarious capital structure" and negative free cash flow generation.\par \par \uc2 Oi, Brazil's fourth-largest telecom firm, blamed its financial collapse on a series of factors, including heavy borrowing to complete mergers and acquisitions that have not helped the firm close the technology gap with its main competitors.\par \par \uc2 Telecoms clients now favor mobile telephones and broadband internet access, and Oi has had less success than its competitors in penetrating those two markets. Oi's two mergers, with \uc2 Brasil Telecom SA\uc2  and \uc2 Portugal Telecom SGPS SA\uc2 , failed to have the desired effect of improving its balance sheet.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COi has financial and operations problems, competition is hard, the market is very regulated and technology becomes obsolete fast," said Alexandre Furtado Montes, a telecommunications analyst at Rio de Janeiro-based consulting firm Lopes Filho.\par \par \uc2 The company posted a net loss of 1.64 billion reais (about $476 million) in the first quarter, compared with a loss of 447 million reais in the prior-year period. Net revenue dropped 4% over the same period.\par \par \uc2 Oi, which has a 34.4% share of Brazil's fixed-line market and about 70 million clients, asked a Rio de Janeiro court late Monday for protection from creditors, the equivalent to a chapter 11 filing in the U.S., after debt restructuring talks with creditors recently.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, Chief Executive Officer Bayard Gontijo resigned while the talks were still open. The company gave no specific reason for his departure, but people close to him said he backed a proposal to convert debt into equity and give bondholders a controlling stake in the restructured company.\par \par \uc2 The plan, however, was opposed by the firm\u180\'00\'B4s main shareholder, Bratel BV, which was created by former shareholders of \uc2 Portugal Telecom\uc2  using the official name \uc2 Pharol SGPS\uc2 . Pharol controls 27.2% of Oi shares directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe main reason for Oi\u180\'00\'B4s bankruptcy protection request is Pharol," Mr. Montes said, noting Oi has a market capitalization of only about 1 billion reais, and owes more than 30 times its value to international creditors. Shareholders \u8220\'20\'1Clost the company a long time ago, it's no longer theirs," he added.\par \par \uc2 Pharol supported Oi's bankruptcy filing plan, and rejected the deal favored by Mr. Gontijo, because it didn't want to dilute its stake so sharply, according to people familiar with the situation. Pharol on Tuesday said it reaffirms its \u8220\'20\'1Cdetermination to continue to defend the value of its main asset."\par \par \uc2 Shareholders including Pharol had been negotiating with creditors represented by investment bank \uc2 Moelis & Co\uc2 , which will continue working with international investors such as \uc2 Pacific Investment Management\uc2  and Co., \uc2 Citadel LLC\uc2  and \uc2 Wellington Management Co\uc2 , according to a person close to the negotiations.\par \par \uc2 The indebted company could also be sold or merge with a local or international telecommunications player, some analysts said.\par \par \uc2 Oi could also sell only a specific business or one of its subsidiaries, said Arthur Almeida, a S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo-based legal analyst at \uc2 Debtwire\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Its large base of fixed-line clients could be helpful to a competitor wanting to expand its businesses in other segments as well, Mr. Almeida noted.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt's possible one of the larger telecommunications companies operating in Brazil may show interest in Oi. It's also viable that an international candidate could come up, as Brazil is cheap for outsiders, \u8220\'20\'1C said Leme's Mr. Brugger.\par \par \uc2 Oi has been roiled by management instability and failed attempts to find new sources of capital. Marco Schroeder, who replaced Mr. Gontijo earlier in this month, is the company's sixth chief executive since 2011. A potential deal with Russian billionaire \uc2 Mikhail Fridman\uc2  to help Oi finance a merger with \uc2 Telecom Italia SpA\uc2 's Brazilian unit fell through in February.\par \par \uc2 Local news media have reported that Egyptian billionaire \uc2 Naguib Sawiris\uc2 , owner of Global Telecom, is considering purchasing part of Oi.\par \par \uc2 Write to Luciana Magalhaes at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Luciana.Magalhaes@dowjones.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Luciana.Magalhaes@dowjones.com}}}\uc2 , Rogerio Jelmayer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:rogerio.jelmayer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rogerio.jelmayer@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Patricia Kowsmann at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:patricia.kowsmann@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 patricia.kowsmann@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160621ec6l00asy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

"They may want to be part of a pan-European exchange group where they can still keep their identity but grow at the same time."\par \par \uc2 Euronext\uc2 , which was spun out of \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange\uc2  of the US in an initial public offering in 2014, runs bourses in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. The remaining independents in the region include Madrid, Luxembourg and Vienna.\par \par \uc2 Others potential targets include any exchanges that have to be sold to win regulatory approval for the LSE-Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse deal, which is expected to close at the start of next year.\par \par \uc2 "Some assets might be sold [as part of the deal], and some of those assets might be interesting to look at," he says.\par \par \uc2 Analysts point to the \uc2 LSE\uc2 's 57 per cent stake in LCH.Clearnet, a clearing house for derivative and bond trades, and \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 's ownership of Clear-stream, one of the region's biggest settlement houses.\par \par \uc2 Large deals are not the core of Euro-next's three-year strategy, however. Its official plan, outlined in May, is to grow "quasi-organically", investing \u8364\'20\'AC100m to \u8364\'20\'AC150m by 2019 to diversify away from its core equity strength. The group wants to grow in areas such as data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , exchange traded funds, open-source indices and commodities.\par \par \uc2 Euronext\uc2  plans to increase revenue about 5 per cent a year and increase group operating margins from 57 per cent - one of the highest in Europe - to between 61 and 63 per cent by 2019.\par \par \uc2 Mr Boujnah says the group cannot just be "more efficient", however. "When you are small, you can be agile, and you must be agile . . . The conditions are there for us to be able to use our balance sheet to react very quickly."\par \par \uc2 An interest in larger deals comes in part because \uc2 Euronext\uc2 , with a market value of about \u8364\'20\'AC2.4bn, is four times smaller than \uc2 LSE\uc2  and \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 . The expected merger would make \uc2 Euronext\uc2  a minnow in Europe.\par \par \uc2 Mr Boujnah stresses that the LSE-Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse combination is far from done. "All I can say is that the last 20 years show that these transformational deals always take a lot longer than expected and never turn out as initially anticipated."\par \par \uc2 He highlights some of the potential hurdles. "The \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  shareholders, the \uc2 LSE\uc2  shareholders, the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 , the prudential supervisors and various other regulators in Germany all need to sign off on this. Anything can happen."\par \par \uc2 Careful not to criticise the deal itself, he says there could be competition issues creating a trading group some 10 times the size of \uc2 Euronext\uc2 , its next largest competitor in Europe.\par \par \uc2 The planned combination of LCH and Eurex Clearing "is essentially combining two banks", Mr Boujnah says, and so could raise "too big to fail issues".\par \par \uc2 There is also the risk that the value of the two companies will change, particularly after this week's referendum on whether or not the UK will remain in the \uc2 EU\uc2 , he says.\par \par \uc2 "It is always difficult to deliver any paper deal a year from closing, let alone with Brexit in the middle."\par \par \uc2 His carefully chosen words belie the intense lobbying that is going on in France against the British-German deal.\par \par \uc2 Last month Michel Sapin, French finance minister, said he wanted to "express the concern of the French government on this tie-up . . . We have doubts about the consequences this could have for the financing of the real economy in France and Europe".\par \par \uc2 If a deal goes ahead, says Mr Boujnah, it will not change his core strategy. "They [\uc2 LSE\uc2  and \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2 ] will focus on being a global player in indices, derivatives and post-trade," he says.\par \par \uc2 Euronext\uc2 's focus in on profitability, strengthening the core business, and to "focus on financing the real economy in Europe", he says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160621ec6l00033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The mobile ad company Verve, which helps marketers target people with ads using location data, is acquiring Roximity, a Denver-based startup that manages a network of beacons in stores across the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Verve recently raised $30 million in debt financing through its partnership with \uc2 Silicon Valley Bank\uc2 . Some of that new funding will be used to pay for Roximity, said Verve Chief Executive \uc2 Nada Stirratt\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.\par \par \uc2 The 11-year old Verve provides software and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to 25,000 mobile apps and websites, such as apps like WeatherBug and a range of local news and information websites owned by media companies including \uc2 Meredith Corp\uc2 . and Gannett's Co.'s \uc2 USA Today\uc2 . Verve sells ads for 40,000 mobile publishers overall.\par \par \uc2 The company is able to collect first-party location data on 30 million devices from these relationships, which it then uses to deliver targeted mobile ads.\par \par \uc2 Now, the plan is to take that location data and connect it with Roximity's beacon data culled from 35,000 store locations (such as \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 ) to start helping marketers gauge whether mobile ads spur visits to stores.\par \par \uc2 More retailers are placing beacons\u8212\'20\'14small pieces of hardware\u8212\'20\'14in their stores in the U.S. These retailers, in partnership with beacon providers, can track when people enter stores and, in some cases, even when they visit specific aisles. Companies like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-latest-offering-explores-the-great-indoors-1401655436"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Apple have been investing in this area }}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Beacons like Roximity's product emit a unique Bluetooth signal. In this case, as long as a person has installed an app on their phone that Verve's software is connected to and they've opted in to allow that app to use their location, a beacon can ping their phone. Roximity can use that beacon signal to determine where a person's phone is\u8212\'20\'14near a store's entrance or in a particular aisle. The beacon devices only work when a person is nearby, and they don't know exactly who the individual is.\par \par \uc2 Tom Kenney\uc2 , Verve's chief innovation officer and co-founder, said the combination of the two companies' technologies should prove more powerful than typical data pulled from just mobile devices.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGPS is good," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut it is sometimes not great. The best and most accurate data comes from beacons." As a result of the deal and Roximity's partnerships with retailers, Verve should have access to direct, first-party data from over 50 million mobile devices, he said.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with CMO Today at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Ms. Stirratt said that for too long, when it comes to mobile location data, the ad industry has focused on the idea of beaming someone a coupon when they walk past a \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 . That sort of tactic is a smaller part of Verve's business.\par \par \uc2 The bigger opportunity is using a person's anonymously collected location history to serve that person an ad at a later time, Ms. Stirratt said. And with Roximity's data, Verve should be able to better prove that location-based advertising drives results, she said. \u8220\'20\'1CBrands want to see this is working, and attribution is a big deal," she said.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Roximity has beacons installed in \uc2 National CineMedia\uc2  movie theaters. Instead of delivering an ad to a moviegoer when they are already headed to the latest blockbuster and have probably made up their mind about what they want to see, Verve can use Roximity's data to put together a collection of anonymous mobile phone users who have visited certain theaters multiple times over a given period of time and send those people ads at a later date for the next big summer movie on the calendar.\par \par \uc2 According to Ms. Stirratt, Verve is profitable and has grown revenue by 50% over the past four years.\par \par \uc2 In addition to pushing into beacon technology, Ms. Stirratt said that Verve is starting a new initiative aimed at creating better, more mobile-appropriate ad units, including an ad that people will be able to save on their phones and respond to later so as not to interrupt their mobile content experiences.\par \par \uc2 Write to Mike Shields at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:mike.shields@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mike.shields@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160621ec6l008vh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Here is a transcript of the hearing, provided by Federal News Service.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: The committee will come to order.\par \par \uc2 Today, we received testimony from Federal Reserve Chair \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  regarding the Fed's semi-annual report on monetary policy. While Humphrey Hawkins' testimony is a key part of Congress' oversight ofour nation's central bank, it is not sufficient to provide Congress and the American public with a full picture of Fed policy making.\par \par \uc2 I have often remarked during these hearings about the importance of striking the right balance between transparency and independence. One of the Fed's stated reasons for maintaining its independence is to avoid politicizing its decisions.\par \par \uc2 I agree that politics have no place at the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , and while the line between politics and policy can be quite fine, it should, nonetheless, be clear and unambiguous. The Fed should act, I believe, in a manner consistent with its statutory mandate in the interest of the stability of the U.S. economy, whether or not such policies are aligned with the goals of Congress or the administration.\par \par \uc2 Related Reading\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-points-to-slow-growth-and-low-rates-in-the-long-run-1466517612"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Yellen: Recession Unlikely, but Long-Run Growth Could Be Slow}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-says-fed-isnt-considering-negative-rates-1466521890"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Yellen: Not Considering Negative Rates, Chances of Recession \u8216\'20\'18Quite Low'}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-chair-janet-yellen-warns-of-volatility-if-uk-exists-eu-1466521889?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Yellen Warns of Volatility if U.K. Exits EU}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-chair-janet-yellen-says-minorities-have-yet-to-benefit-from-economic-recovery-1466517599?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Fed Pressed on Questions of Diversity}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-fed-working-on-stress-test-tailoring-1466521380?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Yellen: Fed Working on Stress Test Tailoring}}}\par \par \uc2 Our central bank is independent and should remain so. The desire to preserve the Fed's independence should not preclude consideration of additional measures to increase the transparency of the board's actions. In fact, some have argued that better disclosure of monetary policy strategy could actually bolster independence.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, a prominent group of economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, agreed in a statement that, and I'll quote, \u8220\'20\'1CPublicly reporting a strategy helps prevent policymakers from bending under pressure and sacrificing independence." The Fed continues to resist calls by Congress to disclose monetary rules, even though it claims it uses such rules regularly.\par \par \uc2 It is public communication the Fed has veered further away from data-driven analysis towards the exercise of even more discretion.\par \par \uc2 For example, rather than adhering precisely to its stated goals for inflation and employment, the Federal Open Market Committee appears to base certain decisions on factors such as, quote, "Financial and international developments that cannot be derived from quantitative analysis."\par \par \uc2 Similarly, the Fed's regulatory conduct is becoming increasingly opaque and complicated. This is demonstrated by the inherent complexity and overlap in its capital and liquidity rules, stress testing and resolution and recovery planning. Two weeks ago, a panel of experts testified before this committee that complex regulations might actually increase, rather than decrease risk in the banking system. They also criticized the lack of analysis and transparency in the rulemaking process.\par \par \uc2 This is especially true of the Basel Rules established by the international committee and imposed by domestic regulators on our institutions without adequate tailoring. The Fed did not even do its own quantitative study for Basel III as it did, Madam Chair, for Basel I and II. It instead relied on the \uc2 Basel Committee\uc2 's analysis, which included data from only 13 -- only 13 U.S. banks out of the 249 banks that were studied. Such an approach is concerning.\par \par \uc2 The Fed should perform, I believe, rigorous analysis, not only for each rule, but also on a cumulative impact of capital and liquidity regulations. If our banking regulation -- regulators are unable or unwilling to conduct such analysis then we should consider mandating it.\par \par \uc2 Even the European -- \uc2 European Commission\uc2  analyzes these factors in its regulatory framework. In a recent call for evidence, it solicited feedback from the public, quote, "to evaluate the interaction between financial regulations and asses their cumulative impact." We should expect no less from our regulators.\par \par \uc2 Chairman -- lady -- Yellen, I look forward to your testimony today and your thoughts on these important issues and I think it's a very important hearing.\par \par \uc2 Senator Brown.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam chair, welcome back to the committee. We're so glad you're here.\par \par \uc2 Since your last appearance, the economy has made only modest gains. Inflation remains low. Job creation seems to have slowed. Economies of our trading partners are struggling. Uncertainty, most notably with the possibility of Britain's exit from the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , uncertainty remains high.\par \par \uc2 The face of these headwinds, you would think that politicians here at home would do everything we could to promote our economy. Instead, many of them seem intent on doing just the opposite. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are failing to invest in infrastructure, in public works, in research and development, in education and training. The very building blocks of our economic success.\par \par \uc2 If that were not enough, they are trying their level best to undermine the safeguards that dampen the economic crisis and were erected to prevent the next one. They would like to repeal Dodd-Frank and return our country to the casino capitalism that caused so much ruin for families and communities across our country. And they are trying to politicize and undermine the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  despite that key actions that it has taken to help the recovery. Congress rated its reserves and reduced dividend payments in order to pay for a transportation bill.\par \par \uc2 Many of my colleagues are trying to insert Congress into monetary policy decisions. This committee has yet to even hold a hearing on the two nominees to the board of governors of the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 . Bad legislative ideas continue to multiply.\par \par \uc2 The presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is a factory of bad ideas. Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  recently released a report that states that if adopted, his economic proposals would leave our economy, quote, "significantly weaker," unquote.\par \par \uc2 He suggested he replace the current Fed chair based on imagined partisan political considerations. That is a bad idea. You might argue that someone is failing to pursue the right course in monetary regulatory policy, but partisan labels should never be part of that discourse.\par \par \uc2 The presumptive nominee has suggested he would simply renegotiate or renege on our debt, comfortable in the belief that the United States can never default, quote, "because you print the money." In his opinion, he understands debt better than probably anybody. His words. He also thinks along with the runner-up for the Republican nomination that this country should return to the gold standard.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Ron Paul\uc2  was promoting this idea a few years ago, The Wall Street Journal reported on a poll of a panel of economists on whether a return to the gold standard would improve price stability and unemployment. The response was split between those who disagreed and those who strongly disagreed. Not one person thought it would help. So we don't know if it's just a bad idea or a really, really bad idea.\par \par \uc2 But as one University of Chicago professor put it, love of the gold standard implies macroeconomic illiteracy. If your own very good brain is your top consultant, I suppose unanimous opinion of a diverse group of economists does not count for much.\par \par \uc2 But for those of us in the evidence-based world, the prospect of this nominee trading imagined for real authority gives added significance to what we do in the banking committee and Congress. That's true in general. It's particularly true with maintaining the independence of the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  and the other regulators of the financial services industry.\par \par \uc2 Madam Chair, I think you have shown your commitment to an independent data-driven \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 . I commend you for that, we are grateful for that, I hope we can work together to maintain it.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Madam Chair, your written testimony in its entirety will be made part of the hearing record. We welcome you here today again, you're no stranger to this committee and you proceed as you wish.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Thank you, Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Brown, and other members of the committee. I am pleased to present the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's semi-annual monetary policy report to the Congress. In my remarks today, I will briefly discuss the current economic situation and outlook before turning to monetary policy. Since my last appearance before this committee in February, the economy has made further progress toward the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's subjective of maximum employment. And while inflation has continued to run below our two percent objective, the Federal Open Market Committee expects inflation to rise to that level over the medium term.\par \par \uc2 However, the pace of improvement in the labor market appears to have slowed more recently, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate. In the labor market, the cumulative increase in jobs since its trough in early 2010, has now topped 14 million, while the unemployment rate has fallen more than 5 percentage points from its peak. In addition, as we detail in the monetary policy report, jobless rates have declined for all major demographic groups including for African Americans and Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 Despite these declines however, it's troubling that unemployment rates for these minority groups remain higher than for the nation overall and that the annual income of the median African American household is still well below the median income of other U.S. households. During the first quarter of this year, job gains average 200,000 per month. Just a bit slower than last year's pace. And while the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent over this period, the labor force participation rate moved up noticeably.\par \par \uc2 In April and May however, the average pace of job gains slowed to only 80,000 per month, or about 100,000 per month after adjustment for the effects of the strike. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in May, but that decline mainly occurred because fewer people reported that hey were actively\par \par \uc2 seeking work. A broader measure of labor market slack it includes workers marginally attached to the workforce and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work, was unchanged in May and remains above its level prior to the recession. Of course it's important not to overreact to one or two reports. In several other timely indicators of timely labor market conditions still look favorable. One notable development is that there is some tentative signs that wage growth may finally be picking up.\par \par \uc2 That said, we will be watching the job market carefully to see whether the recent slowing in employment growth is transitory as we believe it is. Economic growth has been uneven over recent quarters. U.S. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is currently estimated to have increased in an annual rate of only three quarters percent in the first quarter of this year.\par \par \uc2 Subdued far in growth and the appreciation of the dollar weighed on exports. While the energy sector was hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid-2014. In addition, business investment outside of the energy sector was surprisingly weak. However, the available indicators point to a noticeable step up in GDP growth in the second quarter. In particular, consumer spending has picked up smartly in recent months. Supported by solid growth in real disposable income and the ongoing affects of the increases in household wealth. And housing has continued to recover gradually, aided by income gains and the very low levels of mortgage rates.\par \par \uc2 The recent pickup in household spending together with underlying conditions that are favorable for growth, lead me to be optimistic that we will see further improvements in the labor market and the economy more broadly over the next few years. Monetary policy remains accommodative. Low oil prices and ongoing job gains should continue to support the growth of incomes, and therefore consumer spending. Fiscal policy is now a small positive for growth and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. As a result, the FOMC expects that with gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen further.\par \par \uc2 Turning to inflation, overall consumer prices is measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased just one percent over the twelve months ending in April, up noticeable from its pace through much of last year, but still well short of the committee's two percent objective.\par \par \uc2 Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy prices and lower prices for imports. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to one and a half percent.\par \par \uc2 As the transitory influences holding down inflation fade, and the labor market strengthens further, the committee expects inflation to rise to two percent of the median term.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, in considering future policy decision, we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal. Of course, considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook remains. The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk that domestic demand might falter. In addition, although I'm optimistic about the longer run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue into the future.\par \par \uc2 Vulnerabilities in the global economy also remain. Although concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth. More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation and all ready very accommodative monetary policy, in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of an appetite for risk can change abruptly.\par \par \uc2 One development that could shift investors' sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the \uc2 European Union\uc2  could have significant economic repercussions. For all of these reasons, the committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and their implications for domestic economic activity, labor markets and inflation. I will turn next to monetary policy. The FOMC seeks to promote maximum employment and price stability as mandated by Congress. Given the economic situation I just described, monetary policy has remained accommodative over the first half of this year. To support further improvements in the labor market and a return of inflation to our two percent objective.\par \par \uc2 Specifically, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at one quarter to one half percent and has kept the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's holdings of longer terms securities at an elevated level.\par \par \uc2 The committee's actions reflect a careful assessment of the appropriate setting for monetary policy taking into account continuing below target inflation and the mixed readings on the labor market and economic growth seen this year. Proceeding cautiously in raising the federal funds rate will allow us to keep the monetary policy -- the monetary support to economic growth in place while we asses where the growth is returning to a moderate pace, whether the labor market will strengthen further and whether inflation will continue to make progress toward our two percent objective.\par \par \uc2 Another factor that supports taking a cautious approach in raising the federal funds rate, is that the federal funds rate is still near its effective lower band. If inflation were to remain persistently low or the labor market were to weaken the Committee would have only limited room to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. However if the economy were to overheat, and inflation seemed likely to move significantly or persistently above two percent, the FOMC could readily increase the target range to the federal funds rate.\par \par \uc2 The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions will improve further, and that the economy will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds, which include restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation and meager productivity growth mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards.\par \par \uc2 If these headwinds slowly fade over time, as the Committee expects, then gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be needed. In line with that view, most FOMC participants based on their projections prepared for the June meeting anticipate the values for the federal funds rate of less than one percent at the end of this year and less than two percent at the end of next year will be consistent with their assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Of course the economic outlook is uncertain, so monetary policy is by no means on a preset course and FOMC participants projections for the federal funds rate are not a predetermined plan for future policy.\par \par \uc2 The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and associate risks. Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee anticipates would likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly. Conversely if the economy were to disappoint a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with their attainment over time.\par \par \uc2 The Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing \uc2 Treasury\uc2  securities and principle payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As highlighted in the statement released after the June FOMC meeting, we anticipate continuing this policy until normalization of the level of federal funds rate is well under way. Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to the effective lower band in the event of a future, large, adverse shock.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Madam Chair, in recent years the Fed has increasingly used forward guidance to shape market expectations. Our defense (ph) frequently incorrect predictions of interest rate increases have caused it to lose some credibility among some quarters. How would you rate the utility of your forward guidance over the past several months?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: In the past several months we have used forward guidance less than we did in the aftermath of the financial crisis when we named calendar dates or gave explicit economic conditions that we would need to see prevailing in the economy before considering an increase in the federal funds rate. We used that forward guidance in the aftermath of the crisis in order to help market participants understand how serious the crisis was and how long we thought we would need to maintain the federal funds rate at a ...\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Are you saying you're not using forward guidance now or you're not relying on it as much?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: We're not relying very much on forward guidance. We do publish every three months participants' projections for the paths of the federal funds rate that they believe will be appropriate in light of their expectations about the performance of the economy and sometimes those paths which participants discuss in their remarks are thought to constitute forward guidance about policy.\par \par \uc2 I do believe those projections are helpful to the public in understanding the path of the economy that participants think is likely and how if those conditions prevail they would see monetary policy as evolving, but as I always emphasize on every occasion including in my prepared remarks those paths, while I think they're helpful, are not a preset plan and not in any way a commitment. We are constantly trying to evaluate in light of incoming information the outlook in risks and you see those paths change over time as we update our evaluation of the economic outlook and I think that's a critical part of monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Has the slowing of the economy in certain areas caused you to kind of hold back a little bit at times the information that you see there?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: For quite some time now we've seen mixed developments in the economy. Some sectors slowing because of the decline in energy prices, strong dollar foreign growth, others providing an offset.\par \par \uc2 Throughout, until the last couple of months, progress in the labor market has held up extremely well.\par \par \uc2 Now for the last few months as I mentioned job gains averaged 100,000 on a strike (ph) adjusted basis, which is a substantial slowdown from the first quarter and from last year.\par \par \uc2 And it is important for us to see ongoing progress in the labor market so that's something we want to carefully evaluate and use a focus of our attention, but economic growth has picked up from a weak pace and if that slowdown is a reflection of weak growth earlier in the year I'm hopeful that we will see stronger job gains going forward and while it is an important report I would also emphasize that it's important never to over-blow the significance of a single report or a short -- a small amount of data.\par \par \uc2 Other information about the labor market suggests it continues to perform well.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Do you see a clear path ahead as far as either trajectory going forward on the economy picking up, or are you not sure yet?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: It's our expectation that is what you see in all of the projections that we're provided in connection last week with our June FOMC meeting, but of course there is uncertainty about that and given that inflation remains low we have the ability to watch economic developments and try to make sure the economy is on a favorable path before raising rates.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Madam Chair, the FOMC's target for the fed funds rate has been at one-half percent or lower since December, 2008. A report last year from the \uc2 Bank of International Settlements\uc2  found that the prolonged period of low interest rates may be damaging the U.S. economy resulting in, and I'll quote, "Too much debt and too little growth." In addition the report states, "The low rates may in part have contributed to costly financial booms and busts." Do you agree that persistently low interest rates can have negative long-term effects on the U.S. economy and could you explain?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, I believe that persistent low interest rates we've had have been essential to achieving the progress, but of course low rates can induce households or banks or firms to reach for yield and can stoke financial instability and we are very attentive to that possibility and I would not at this time say that the threats from low rates to moderate to financial stability are elevated. I do not think they're elevated at this time, but it is of course something that we need to watch because it can have that impact. You mention debt, I don't think we're seeing an (inaudible) build up of debt throughout theeconomy.\par \par \uc2 Leverage remains at moderate levels well below where it was prior to the crisis. We are looking at credit growth, which has picked up but is not at worrisome levels so we are monitoring for potential impacts of low rates on financial stability which I think is appropriate.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Madam Chair, in an interview earlier this month, Governor Tarullo stated that the Fed is reviewing the application stress test to regional banks and he used the word probably will exempt regional banks from the qualitative portion of CCAR. Last December, the Fed announced it was tailoring CCAR, but the tailoring turned out to be just a restatement of existing policy. What assurances can you give that this current review is a meaningful effort to tailor CCAR in a way that recognizes the different risk profiles of banks and if so, what do you expect -- when do you expect to publish such changes for comment?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So we are engaging in a five year very serious review that's been informed by consultation with both financial sector participants and outside economists, and I do think that you'll see meaningful changes the suggestion that Governor Tarullo made that banks between $50 and $250 billion that are subject to the stress test and CCAR might be left out of the qualitative portions of CCAR still the stress test would be applied but the full qualitative part of CCAR that relates to capital planning that they might be exempted form that. I think that's very likely, we will look at other changes as well that as you said, are designed to appropriately tailor it so that its impact is most significant for the largest and most systemic firms. It will be a very meaningful review and I believe we will be proceeding on it shortly.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: My last observation has to do with you alluded to the fact that come Thursday there's a big referendum in the United Kingdom on to whether to stay in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  or start leaving -- what's the real implication or can you tell at this point, if the British were to leave the common market, on us? Could be implications for the common market and for Britain.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, it is a very important relationship. It would be significant for the United Kingdom and for Europe as a whole. I think it would usher in a period of uncertainty and it is very hard to predict, but there could a period of financial market volatility that would negatively affect financial conditions and the U.S. economic outlook that's by no means certain, but it is something that we will be carefully monitoring.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Thank you, Senator Brown.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 Madam Chair I first thank you for your work on the recent insurance rerolls (ph), I'm pleased that the Fed has put out an advanced notice for proposed rule making to implement capital standards for the two large insurance companies the two (inaudible) and the 12 insurance companies that are savings and loan holding companies.\par \par \uc2 I appreciate how quickly you've moved on this and your constructive dialogue with stakeholders. I think that your response to our efforts here made a huge difference in doing this right. This week, the banking committee will have a hearing -- second hearing on capital liquidity (ph) rules. Please discuss for us the Fed's approach to capital and liquidity (ph) rules for the nation's largest banks. Specifically, how these new rules made our financial system stronger.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So I do believe that the enhancements that we've put in place to capital and liquidity requirements that are tailored by firm size and systemic importance have made an enormous difference to the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial system. The quantity of capital at the largest banking work organizations is essentially double from before the crisis and the quality of that capital is very much higher. In addition to imposing higher static risk based capital and leverage requirements, our stress testing and capital planning exercises are very detailed forward looking exercises that are working to ensure that the largest firms in extremely stressful conditions would be able to go on supporting the credit needs of the U.S. economy of households and businesses and I think this has been a very significant exercise and has resulted in far superior understanding by the firms themselves of the risks they face and improve management of those risks. Capital isn't sufficient to assure financial stability, often liquidity is what disappears in a financial crisis, and we've put in place, especially for the largest banking organizations, enhancements to liquidity through the liquidity coverage ratio and our proposed (inaudible) funding ratio. And so I think this also works to enhance financial stability, so I think we have a much safer and sounder list (ph) crisis prone system because of the enhancements that we've put in place.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you. We've talked in the past about how the current labor market data did not reflect what's happened to minorities whose rates of unemployment are still much higher than average. Your testimony today, for the first time and thank you for that, you talked about minority unemployment rates and have included a new section in the semi-annual monetary policy report with this data in a discussion of whether the gains of the economic expansion have been widely enough shared. Discuss why the Fed made this addition to the report.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's job is to try to achieve maximum employment and broad gains in the labor market that are as widely distributed as possible. And I believe it's very important for us to monitor how different groups in the labor market are doing to see if what we perceive is broad-based labor market improvement is being widely shared and there are very significant differences in success in the labor market across demographic groups. And I think it's important for us to be aware of those differences and to focus on them as we think about monetary policy and the forward work (ph) that the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  does in the area of community development in trying to make sure that financial services are widely available to those that need it including low and moderate income...\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Well, that brings to my -- the meeting I had just a few minutes ago with three people from my hometown of Cleveland. Three community leaders about the lack of diversity in terms of gender and ethnicity and race and the lack of diversity in terms of ideas that are the class C (ph) directors in many of your Federal Reserves, your 12 Federal Reserves around the country, including in Cleveland. I'd like to see a more -- and I think many of us on this panel, would like to see a more diverse \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  system including the governors, the bank presidents, and the 12 regions, the board of directors, the advisory committees and employees. Discuss what you've done as chair of the Fed, what more you can do to better address the financial needs of all Americans as you reach into the community better.\par \par \uc2 And I know you've had a goal of doing that. You said that at the first hearing, certainly at one of our first meetings. Particularly serving those unserved and underserved by the financial system.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I am personally committing, the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  as an organization is committed to, achieving diversity within our workforce and within our leadership at absolutely all levels. I believe we have made progress. I am committed to seeing us make further progress and in order to make sure that we're taking all of the steps that we possible can to promote diversity in economic inclusion. I've launched an interdisciplinary effort within the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  to focus on all of our diversity initiatives, both in terms of our own hiring, hiring throughout the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  system, our working community development to promote access to credit, our work in the payments system, to foster better and faster payments that can promote financial inclusion.\par \par \uc2 I do believe we're making some progress but I want us to make greater progress. If the Board minorities currently represent 18 percent and women represent 37 percent of senior leadership, that's relatively common that's throughout the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  system you would see similar numbers, and we've worked very hard to increase diversity among the Reserve Bank Directors and Directors on the branch boards and made quite a lot of progress. At this point minority representation stands at about 24 percent of Reserve Bank and branch board directors, about 30 percent are women.\par \par \uc2 It's a matter that the Board focuses on annually in its oversight of the Reserve Banks. We regularly track our progress in increasing diversity in the boards of directors and it's something we will continue to focus on. Diversity is an extremely important goal and I will do everything I can to further it. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: My last question. I want you to share with us the continual way the progress you're making there especially in the Class C directors that today more represent the community than -- it's not just diversity of look and background but diversity of ideas and all that. Last question -- there are currently a record number of job openings, 6 million, but the May data show that workers are not being hired for these jobs. What do we do to get Americans who want to work into these available jobs? What do we need to do better?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: There are an enormous number of job openings and there is a certain degree of mismatch of workers who are looking for work with the job openings that are available. And within the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , and I personally have been looking at workforce development programs, job training programs, some of which I think are doing a very good job of trying to build the skills that are needed to fill available jobs and work to match workers with jobs.\par \par \uc2 I was recently in Philadelphia and visited a very impressive program that's placing workers who've had trouble in the job market into real jobs that can lead to upward mobility in a career in some of the Philadelphia hospitals. I've seen such programs around the country that I think have been effective but obviously our job at the Fed is to make sure we have a strong job market that there are enough jobs that are being created but helping that matching process, looking at training programs and educational opportunities. I think that's a piece of the puzzle as well.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: As you have from time to time mentioned -- exhorted is maybe too strong a word -- that Congress needs to do a better job in terms of investment in public works and infrastructure. Also you have made comments from time to time about job training. Can you give us more instruction -- in my last minute or so -- can you give us more instruction on what we should do here?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I'm not going to give you detailed instruction and I think this is up to Congress to decide, but when one looks at either inclusion or inequality or more broadly the fact that we're suffering as a country from very low productivity growth, disappointingly low productivity growth, and we think about what the factors are that over time influence productivity growth, the things that have long been identified as important are investments, both private and public and we have had private investment really since the financial crisis has been very weak, but private and public investments, education and workforce development and the pace of technological progress which is influenced by the environment that contributes to innovation, the startup of new firms and research and development and other basic supports.\par \par \uc2 So I think that all of those areas should be on Congress' list to focus on.\par \par \uc2 BROWN: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Corker?\par \par \uc2 CORKER: Madame Chairman, we thank you for being here and thank you for your service. I had numbers of conversations in this setting and others with your predecessor about QE2 and QE3. And I know the Fed announced in 2014 the normalization process and both your predecessor and the normalization process was announced in 2014 stated that the securities that we had built up on the balance sheet would be held to maturity. And then they would run off the balance sheet.\par \par \uc2 You basically announced today that we're embarking on QE4. By reinvesting the proceeds have you not -- in new securities, which is a major policy change, is it not? From where the Fed has been and allowing these securities to run off and allowing -- maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying but I thought I heard you say that the Fed is now, when we reach maturity on these securities, going to reinvest them,which is a pretty big policy change, is it not?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: It is not a policy change. That's long been our policy. Ever since QE3 ended we made clear that we would continue to reinvest maturing proceeds. We've been doing that ever since. We did say that as the economy recovers and the fed funds rate rises to a somewhat higher level than it is at present that a day would come when based on economic and financial conditions the Committee would begin the process you just described of gradually allowing securities to run off our balance sheet so that we would reduce our holdings to a more normal level.\par \par \uc2 And we fully intend to do that, but I can't give you a precise timetable for when that policy will begin. It's going to depend on how the economy evolves. But a long time ago we put out a set of normalization principles where we made clear that that was how we would proceed, namely continue reinvestment until after we had begun the process of raising the federal funds rate and achieve sufficient progress there. That remains our intention.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: Well, thank you for clearing that up. I appreciate that. I know last time you were here we alluded to negative rates and I know that's what's happened in Japan and the E.U. And you were looking into the legality, or your staff was looking into, you felt the legal basis to pursue negative rates. Have you come to a conclusion relative to that?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I believe we do have the legal basis to pursue negative rates but I want to emphasize it is not something that we are considering. This is not a matter that we are actively looking at, considering.\par \par \uc2 When we've looked at it, or looked at that in the past, we have identified significant shortcomings of that type of approach. I don't think we're gonna have to provide accommodation and if we do that's not something that's on our list. But I do think we have the legal authority.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: Very good and I really appreciate your clearing that up. Obviously, Japan and the E.U. have not had good benefit from that, or at least it's not benefit that we can see that has been good for them. So I appreciate you clearing that up, that's very good.\par \par \uc2 We look at the Taylor Rule (ph) from time to time and I know the Fed has not adopted the Taylor Rule.\par \par \uc2 But if you look at it, Bloomberg has a chart that tracks it and basically, Fed rates and the Taylor Rule have been within a -- within a range.\par \par \uc2 Recently, there's this (ph) biggest dichotomy that we've seen in years and years between Fed funds rate and what they would be if the Taylor rule was being employed. Today, it's at 25 to 50 basis points, under the Taylor rule; we would be at 3.7 percent.\par \par \uc2 That would be our (ph) target fed rate today. Big, big range difference and is that is that because of the headwinds that you've been alluding to and just what you're generally seeing in the market?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Yes, I believe it is because of the headwinds. One of the numbers in the Taylor Rule reflects Professor Taylor's estimate of what we sometimes refer to as the neutral level of the fed funds rate.\par \par \uc2 It's a level of the fed funds rate that is consistent with the economy operating at full employment. And that's something that, by our estimate, has been very depressed in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Discussions about secular stagnation are very much about what is the level of interest rates that is consistent with the economy operating at full employment.\par \par \uc2 I'm hopeful that rate will rise over time, although I'm uncertain. But at the moment, most of the divergence between our settings and what would be the higher levels that would be called for merely reflect the headwinds facing the economy since the financial crisis...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 CORKER: The labor, the labor -- I've only got a little bit of time -- the labor, the employment rate really, is misleading, is it not? Relative to where we are in the labor market today? Meaning that there's still a lot of excess capacity.\par \par \uc2 And I know Ranking Member Brown was alluding to that and you. So that equation is a little bit off just because you're not really feeling the employment levels, even though the rates that we show her there, the involvement by the labor market it's not what we'd like for it to be.\par \par \uc2 Let me just ask one last thing gratefully, living wills. I know under Section 165 of Dodd-Frank, the larger institutions are supposed to present living wills. And you all are supposed to ensure that they can be resolved in bankruptcy and I know we're going through hopefully the final iteration in the next several months.\par \par \uc2 But I was confused in that Governor Powell recently mentioned that if the fed just keeps raising capital levels, these institutions will own their own downsides or become less complex. And I'm just confused by that.\par \par \uc2 Is the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , if these institutions cannot be resolved in bankruptcy, going to do what Section 165 of Dodd-Frank gives them -- tells them to do or are you going to rely on raising capital to cause the banks to do it themselves?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, we are insisting that the firms address in some cases deficiencies and in other shortcomings that are -- that we've found and numerated it in the living wills and the last submission.\par \par \uc2 There's a timetable for doing that.\par \par \uc2 If the firms fail to address the deficiencies or if later on, by the summer of 2017, they fail to address the shortcomings, we've identified and we find (ph) them deficient. Dodd-Frank does say what (ph) the \uc2 FDIC\uc2  and the Fed can impose higher capital requirements, liquidity requirements or ultimately structural changes. Don't expect to have to go there.\par \par \uc2 But we are insisting that the firms address the deficiencies in shortcomings that we've carefully identified.\par \par \uc2 CORKER: Thank you, Madam Chairman.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Reed?\par \par \uc2 REED: Well, thank you very much Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 And thank you, Madam Chair. It strikes me that over the last several years you've had a very difficult challenge, we all have had. But we've been operating in some respects with one hand tied behind our back. Which is you've been pursing a very expansionary policy to stimulate the economy, cutting rates and reluctant to raise rates.\par \par \uc2 While we have not had a complementary fiscal policy that invests in infrastructure and other things and it allows you the room to raise rates, if necessary, or to complement your activity with what we're doing.\par \par \uc2 And the point you just made in response to Senator Brown is that this productivity gap, which is very troubling, some of that is just related to decrepit infrastructure. If it takes two hours to get someplace, that's two lost hours for (inaudible) someone delivering a package. If it takes 10 minutes in a superhighway (ph), that's productivity increased. So you're in a position I think that you're doing all you can but it's not enough and we have to step up. Is that something you would tend to sympathize with?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, I think in the United States and many other advanced nations where interest rates are at very low levels, it's common to say that monetary policy, central banks, who've been carrying the load in many parts of the world, fiscal policy has -- because of concern about large standard, not played a supportive role.\par \par \uc2 I think we have achieved a lot in the United States. We have created over 14 million jobs. The unemployment rate has come down to 4.7 percent. Inflation is still under two percent but I believe moving up.\par \par \uc2 So I think we are making good progress but if there were to be a negative shock to the economy and I mentioned this in my testimony, starting with very low levels of interest rates, we don't have a lot of room using our traditional tried and true method to respond.\par \par \uc2 If fiscal policy were more expansionary this neutral level of interest rates, one of the factors that affects what level of interest rates is neutral for the economy keeps it on an even keel. The level would be higher with a different stance of fiscal policy.\par \par \uc2 REED: We had made progress, all right, great. But I think the sense is not only could we have made more progress but we're at a point now where you've exhausted most of your leverage in a nonfinancial sense.\par \par \uc2 But your leverage and if there was a shock, you have very little to respond with.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, we have the same tools that we used earlier, mainly. Asset purchases, forward guidance, maturity distribution, duration of our portfolios and those are the tools we would rely on.\par \par \uc2 REED: And just very quickly, the other part of this dilemma is the sense in some places is that because interest rates have been so low, there is a possibility of creating a bubble.\par \par \uc2 Fro example, driving people into equities because there's no return and the price is driven up, not because of the underlying quality of the equity but simply that's -- that's where they can get some money fast. Are you concerned about that?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, that is -- yes, I mean -- as I said earlier, I don't see signs of extreme threats to financial stability at this time. This is something we monitor very closely. But it is something that can happen in a low-interest rate environment.\par \par \uc2 So I don't think that I see any broad-based evidence of those financial stability concerns but it is -- it is something that's possible.\par \par \uc2 REED: And I have less than a minute but let me just -- with respect to cyber security, we had a discussion last time you were here. It is an increasing problem, in fact, the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  and public reports that you have been breached, in some respect.\par \par \uc2 But just getting to the point, do you have the authority to require you're regulated to companies to put people on their boards that have cyber security expertise? And also to publicly disclose what their cyber security general for evidence are or something to Indicate to the public that they're taking this seriously?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, it is a focus of our supervision. We do have standards that we expect financial institutions to meet. And just what's expected depends on the complexity and importance of the firm. So this is -- we do regard this as a very significant threat.\par \par \uc2 On your question about boards of directors, I don't know that we have -- that we have looked at that. I'd need to get back to you on that. But we are certainly supervising financial institution ability to address cyber threats.\par \par \uc2 REED: Thank you, Madam Chair.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Vitter?\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Thank you, Madam Chair, for being here and for your service.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Madam Chair, in April the Fed finally released the results of the 2015 resolution plans of eight systemically important domestic banking institutions and five of the nation's largest banks failed that exercise, including JP MorganChase Bank of America. I have three questions related to that.\par \par \uc2 First, the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  in April described this Fed release as stating "that suggests that if there were another crisis today, the government would need to prop up the largest banks if it wanted to avoid financial chaos." So question one is do you agree with that, question two is what do these five banks need to do first to fully remediate their deficiencies, and question three is if they don't by October 1, will the Fed take more systemic action like raising capital levels?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So those banks who've over the span of the last several years and in which they have been preparing living wills greatly increased their ability to be resolved in the event of trouble by bankruptcy or alternatively, title II (ph) is available. I couldn't guarantee at this point, you know it depends just what the circumstances are in which a bank fails that bankruptcy would work at this point as a means to resolve one of these firms we have identified for five of the firms deficiencies. We've been extremely careful in spelling out in detail what those deficiencies are that we want to see remedied by October 1.\par \par \uc2 And in addition we have listed jointly with the \uc2 FDIC\uc2  a large number of specific shortcomings that the firms have until the summer of 2017 to remedy.\par \par \uc2 And we will be monitoring very carefully and evaluating whether that's done and as I said if the deficiencies are not remedied, or later if the shortcomings are not remedied, they could turn into deficiencies that would provoke us -- lead us to impose higher capital standards or other, you know other remedies on these firms if that isn't done. But I think we have learned a lot in the course of the years we have been evaluating these living wills about what it takes to actually resolve a firm in bankruptcy, the firms who've learned in this process and I do think we have made substantial advances in terms of being able to do that...\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Let me go back to my question -- three questions. First in terms of the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  quote needing to prop up the largest banks, you would not categorically refute that possibility.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, I would not say at this point that all of the mare prepared for resolution under bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 VITTER: And again, if they don't get there for October 1, would you very soon thereafter consider something more systemic like higher capital requirements or not?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 VITTER: OK, and Madam Chair, my second to last question is about the Puerto Rican crisis. You have said you don't think the Fed should be involved and I appreciate that and agree with that. However, my concern is the Fed has authority to be involved, do you think the Fed has authority to issue as a last resort, emergency loans to Puerto Rican institutions or not?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I think our authority is extremely limited and it wouldn't be appropriate for us to give loans to Puerto Rico. We have very limited authority to buying municipal debt and the authority we have, if we were buy eligible debt, I don't think it would be helpful to Puerto Rico, and beyond that we have no ability to make emergency loans. We could not use 13.3 (ph) or emergency powers of that type to extend the loan to Puerto Rico and I don't think it would be this is inherently a matter for Congress and is not something that's appropriate for the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 VITTER: Thank you Madam Chair.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Menendez.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you Madam Chair for your service and your insight, I always appreciate it. Recently in the national public discourse, there are those who propose reducing the national debt by persuading creditors to take a haircut on their investments. And in my opinion policies like that would drive our economy off a cliff and endanger working families in our country. And I really don't know of anyone more qualified to answer this question than you, in your opinion what would be the consequences if the president of the United States were to propose that holders of U.S. treasury bonds accept less than the face value of their investments?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So this is a topic that I've spoken on many times when Congresses were faced debt ceiling type situations. I feel the consequences for the United States and the global economy of defaulting on treasury debt would be very severe. U.S. treasury securities are the safest and most liquid benchmark security in the global financial system. They play a critical role in financial markets and the consequences of such a default while they're uncertain, I think there could be no doubt that it would be long-run harmful to the U.S. interests and at a minimum result in much higher borrowing costs for American households and businesses.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: And saying that you should take a haircut, is it actually means a default because you're not paying the full amount that you're obligated to on the security. And just for clarification purposes, am I right, my understanding that U.S. citizens and American entities such as state and local governments, pension funds, mutual funds, and the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , own the vast majority of U.S. debt estimated at approximately 67.5 percent.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: U.S. entities and foreign entities.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: OK U.S. entities and foreign entities?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: OK my understanding is and, I'd like to get for the record -- my understanding is that just U.S. citizens and American entities, state local governments, pension funds, mutual funds, 401(k)s, \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , own the majority of U.S. debt, and that would be about 67.5 percent, but for the record if you could submit that I'd appreciate it.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Certainly.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Which means the overwhelming majority who would be taking a haircut as proposed by Mr. Trump would ultimately mean U.S. citizens, state and local governments, so that's pretty outrageous. Let me ask you this, in the nearly eight years since the start of the financial crisis, our economy has indeed shown signs of growth and progress, yet many data points indicate that we are far from a full recovery in the labor market.\par \par \uc2 In the past you have advocated for the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's use of a metric called the Labor Market's Condition Index. That index, which pulls data from 19 different labor market sources including labor force participation, workers that are classified as part time for economic reasons, hires, quits and so forth, has fallen nearly 15 points over the last five months. In fact the index has fallen to its lowest level since 2010. My understand is that every other time the index has turned negative for five months or longer over the last 25 years, the Fed has moved to ease monetary policy, not tighten it.\par \par \uc2 So I'm concerned that given the path the Fed has laid out for potential rate increases later this year and next, the Fed will neither have the ability nor the will to temper the impacts of this slowdown in the labor market. Shouldn't the Fed wait to consider additional rate hikes until we see indications of growth in the labor market?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So the numbers that are released on the Labor Market Conditions Index don't refer to the level of the index, but rather the change, and the move that you have mentioned in that index suggests not that the labor market is not operating -- the labor market is operating at a good level according to the level of that index, which we do not publish. There is loss of momentum, that is what the negative numbers show, and we have seen the same thing in the recent job reports that I referred to in my testimony.\par \par \uc2 So, without a doubt, for the last several months, a number of different metrics suggest a loss of momentum, not a deterioration in the labor market, but a loss of momentum in terms of the pace of improvement. And that is an important consideration, as I mentioned. We believe that will turn around, expect it to turn around, but we are taking a cautious approach and watching very carefully to make sure that expectation is borne out before we proceed to raise interest rates further.\par \par \uc2 MENENDEZ: Ms. Chair, one final point, not even a question. I want to echo what Senator Brown has said, and in the letter that I, Senator Warren and Murphy, and 124 members of Congress sent to you with reference to improving the representation at regional banks, 83 percent of \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  members are white, 92 percent of regional bank presidents are white.\par \par \uc2 There is not a single president who is either African-American or someone like me, Latino. That is fundamentally wrong, and I would hope that you would share some diversity effort, because leadership on this issue always comes from the top, regardless of the institution. And with your own experiences as a woman, and in that regard, we seem to be doing a lot better in the system, but we are not doing that much better with people of color. And I hope that you will seriously consider such an effort.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I agree with you that it is extremely important, and I will do everything I can to see that our performance improves in that dimension.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Toomey.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chair Yellen.\par \par \uc2 Chair Yellen, your predecessor, Chairman Bernanke, both before this committee and in columns that he has discussed some of the limits of monetary policy, what monetary policy is capable of, and what it is not capable of. And one of the things that he said -- I'm paraphrasing, but I think he said this on numerous occasion -- is that accommodative monetary policy has the limit of being only stimulative in the sense that it brings economic activity forward in time. It does not create new wealth, goods or services, but it shifts the timing of economic activity.\par \par \uc2 Do you agree with Chairman Bernanke in that respect?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, it -- it sometimes does shift the timing of economic activity, brings forward a decision that might have made -- been made later.\par \par \uc2 But I think the stance of policy also has repercussions that have a more longer-lasting impact on the state of demand. It is not only a matter of shifting purchases early by having more accommodative financial conditions. There are repercussions that can be longer- lasting than that.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: Well, my -- you may disagree, but my sense of the academic consensus is the main effect of accommodative monetary policy is to induce economic activity that was going to occur later, at an earlier time, and that that is the principal activity, or the principle -- but you are acknowledging there is some of that phenomenon.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: There is some of that phenomenon; it is not the only thing.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: So, to what extent is this unprecedented accommodative monetary policy for these many years now part of the reason that we've had relatively anemic growth today?\par \par \uc2 Isn't it very likely the case that some of the economic activity that would be occurring today was dragged forward in years gone by, and it has already occurred in the past?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So, I -- it is very hard to know how large that effect is, but I continue to thank our accommodative stance of policy, for example, low mortgage rates, is continuing to boost activity in the housing sector. It has not only pulled activity forward to suppress it now.\par \par \uc2 I believe it has...\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: The housing sector has still not recovered its previous highs, I mean...\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, it has undergone very substantial shocks.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: Have you attempted to quantify how much of the economic growth that would be occurring in 2017, and 2018, and 2019, is happening now because this ongoing activity of having these extremely low, unnaturally low interest rates?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: We have not tried to determine that. We have, in the past, looked at whether or not low rates have had less impact on spurring economic activity than in the past, namely whether or not there might be some attenuation in the impact of policy.\par \par \uc2 But in the past, our analysis suggested that it is not only a matter of shifting the timing of economic activity, but also stimulating investment and spending decisions...\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: Even if that is so, I mean, my guess is that the principle effect is shifting the timing, and you may disagree with that. I -- I got the from your predecessor impression is that his view was that the principle effect was shifting the timing.\par \par \uc2 It's certainly an effect, and I would think it is something that the Fed ought to be looking at, because to the extent that that is a significant effect, what you're doing today is damaging economic growth going forward to some extent.\par \par \uc2 Let me -- let me touch on another concern. It seems from the many -- from what you and others have said, there has been a great focus on the demand side of the effect on the -- of monetary policy, and not so much on the supply side.\par \par \uc2 One of the concerns that I have is the danger that -- first of all, you have been missing the estimates on the supply side, as well as economic growth overall, right? I mean, we are now, I think, 12 consecutive years in which the Fed has systematically overestimated economic growth, it has been overly optimistic about the supply side phenomenon such as workers returning to the workforce, improving productivity level -- that have not been happening to the extent that the Fed has hoped.\par \par \uc2 And one of my concerns is that the inducement to expand capacity, the unnatural excess capacity that comes from unnaturally low interest rates could get the Fed into a kind of vicious cycle, where all of that capacity creates excess commodities, downward pressure on prices. Makes it that much harder to hit your 2 percent inflation goal. And creates this dilemma that is hard to get out of.\par \par \uc2 Is there a danger that -- that the ultra-low interest rates are contributing to that?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, I -- well, I think investment has been running at a very slow pace. We have really not had the creation of a lot of excess capacity.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: Globally, we have (ph).\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: One of the reasons that productivity growth has been so slow and it has been disappointingly slow is that we have had very weak investment in the aftermath of the crisis, and more recently in recent months, it has turned negative and is extremely low, even outside of energy, where we have a substantial cutback in drilling activity.\par \par \uc2 So, I don't think an impact of low interest rates has been to stimulate an investment boom or a boom in capacity.\par \par \uc2 TOOMEY: No, it's -- I think there's -- that is largely true in the United States, but globally, where this experiment has been going on, since everybody is in this business of ultra-low interest rates, it seems there -- certainly, if you talk to people in the steel industry, they would suggest that there is a massive overcapacity, and not just steel, but in other commodities as well.\par \par \uc2 And I do worry that we have encouraged companies to take on massive amounts of debt to create this overcapacity, and it is just one of many distortions.\par \par \uc2 But I thank you for your time. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Tester.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Yellen, thank you for being here. I have got a couple of questions that I have asked before, and I frankly will do it again. Senator Crapo and myself sent a letter in the (inaudible) process and how that is moving forward.\par \par \uc2 I'm continually concerned about community banks and the level of regulation that match the risk that they pose to the economy and to their depositors and borrowers.\par \par \uc2 We are seeing consolidation in Montana, we're probably consolidation across the country with small banks. And that is not good for capitalism; I don't think it's good for rural America as we see small banks combining with bigger banks, combining with bigger banks.\par \par \uc2 So, my question is, do you -- do you see a problem with the process right now of regulation on our small banks? And if so, what are we doing about it?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: We are heavily focused on trying to find ways to relieve community banks of undue burden. And our tailoring of our regulatory system and supervision system to suit the risks that an entity entails is a core principle for us of proper supervision.\par \par \uc2 So have done, I think -- made very meaningful efforts to reduce the burdens of our examinations on community banks, to reduce the complexity of capital requirements that they face. The (inaudible) process we are taking very seriously and I believe will come out with meaningful proposals for relief and we are looking at something that might be a significant simplification of the capital regime for those community banks.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: OK. I think simplification is important. Are you happy where the Fed is right now as it regards to the community banks?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I think we've made progress, but we'll continue to focus on it.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: OK. Do you -- do you believe that consolidation in the banking industry in particular as it applies to -- well, across the board, doesn't matter -- is not a good thing? And do you think that the regulatory issues have contributed to the consolidation?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I think there have been a number of factors that have contributed to it. This is a challenging environment for banks, a low interest rate environment and profitability has also been important.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Right. In -- and in some cases some of these small banks are putting out literally (ph) millions, and these are small banks, millions of dollars to meet the regulatory issues that are brought up in front -- I just -- I just want to get your commitment you're going to continue to work...\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Absolutely.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: The consolidation piece is something that really bothers me big time, especially as it applies tostates like Montana because that forces us to the big guys and I don't necessarily think that is good for the consumer coming down the line. I think it should be their choice if they want to go that direction.\par \par \uc2 International insurance rules, the Fed has proposed rules for two nonbank SIFIs, \uc2 AIG\uc2  and \uc2 Prudential\uc2  and I'm pleased that the Fed's moving forward with the international insurance rules. Could you give me an idea of when you think these might be complete?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, I think there are some ways to go in terms of the international work that's ongoing. We put out a few weeks ago an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for the framework that we intend to take here in the United States. You know, we are in discussions internationally in advancing these ideas, but I think we are ahead of that process here in the United States.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: So I'll take one more run at it, because I may not have worded it correctly. Do you have any idea when they will be done?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: No.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Will it be done in this administration?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I -- I'll have to get back to you. I don't know what the timetable is.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: OK...\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: You're talking about the international efforts...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Yes. Right. And, you know, how those are going to impact, for instance, \uc2 GE\uc2 , for example, who is a nonbank SIFI. Just curious to figure out how that's going to come down the pipe.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well so \uc2 GE\uc2 , we already published a...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: It's a SIFI.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: ...a rule.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Right.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: It's not insurance.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: It's not an insurance company. What happens to those guys? Does this insurance rule have no impact on them? What happens to those guys moving forward?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: They are not an insurance company.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: I know. But they are a SIFI and they have divested their financial -- their banking part of their business. So what happens to them moving forward?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: There will be something that the FSOC...\par \par \uc2 TESTER: Will take up.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: ...will take up.\par \par \uc2 TESTER: All right. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Kirk.\par \par \uc2 KIRK: Madam Chair, I want to take you to the -- what -- you were just talking about the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for the insurance industry. I am speaking on behalf of large Illinois employers like (ph) State Department (ph) All State would say that Senator Collins and I have been working very hard to make sure the Fed recognizes the great difference between the business of banking and insurance and I would say the ANPR (ph), the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, heads in the right direction there.\par \par \uc2 And I would (ph) ask you that as we look forward to this, as I look at the essence of the ANPR, it seemed like the key stress test was a 90-day window of liquidity that, if I look at the details I would say, 90-day, if you look at someone like \uc2 State Farm\uc2  that affects 80 million families, you would say the stress would be -- given the 2008 drop in various sales of various products, do you have enough money to -- over 90 days -- to sustain the enterprise?\par \par \uc2 I wanted to explore this with you, a common-sense way of letting people know because this is a -- this is a route (ph), the way we should go. I would urge you to follow in the direction of Senator Collins and I, making sure the normal Fed culture of bank regulation does not impinge on the uncertainty (ph) in the insurance industry.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, we have tried to do that very much in developing this proposal. We, you know, have put forward some conceptual frameworks and are going to be looking very carefully at comments before we proceed with more detailed rules and the Collins fix (ph) was very helpful to us in having the flexibility to design something that is appropriate for insurance and not bank centric.\par \par \uc2 KIRK: Thank you. I would -- because I think we got 60 days to comment and I will comment off that (ph)...\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Yes.\par \par \uc2 KIRK: And I will be -- approaching members of this committee to also provide their comments and (inaudible) want to make sure we have a robust and strong insurance sector.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Yes. And we will look at those very carefully. We are trying to proceed in a very thoughtful and careful way based on a great deal of consultation with other regulators, state regulators, the NAIC, the industry, we have taken a lot of comment and look forward to more.\par \par \uc2 KIRK: From what we have heard, the ANPR has been pretty well- received, reflecting the Collins fix nicely.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Great.\par \par \uc2 KIRK: Thank you. Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Warner.\par \par \uc2 WARNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Chair Yellen, it's great to see you. I'm going to try to get three questions in and respect the five-minute rule -- (inaudible) respect this morning to make sure that all our colleagues continue to ask questions. I want to go back to Senator Reed's point about cyber. I think Senator Garner (ph) (inaudible) cyber caucus. I think this is increasingly going to be a challenge for every institution.\par \par \uc2 Senator Reed raised the question about whether under prudential regulations we can make sure that bank (inaudible) -- bank boards and others have cyber expertise. I would hope you would move forward with that.\par \par \uc2 I want to move slightly on your question to the issue around what happened at the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  with the Bangladeshi incursion that was through the SWIFT system. Obviously, the SWIFT system is -- by evidence by this cyber attack, it has some challenges, enormously important to the international baking regimes.\par \par \uc2 Does the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  or the overall Fed, do you feel like you have enough ability to -- work with SWIFT to increase their cyber protections?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: We are part of an oversight group for SWIFT. It's left -- it's led by the National Bank of Belgium.\par \par \uc2 And many supervisors from different countries participate in that group and we also participated in that group. SWIFT and the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  are working with the Bank of Bangladesh to try to understand what happened...\par \par \uc2 WARNER: I would just urge you that this is going to be an area that's going to exponentially grow in importance and both in terms of the Fed's internal expertise and ensuring that we are working more closely with the overall banking industry to up their game, I think, is critically important.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WARNER: ... try to get to the others. A number of us have talked about how we can generate additional job growth. One of the concerns that I have is that -- particularly with -- inside the public markets, that we have seen an enormous rush over the last decade plus starting in the '90s, but really over the last decade and the last few years, even more particular toward short-term (ph) in terms of views versus long-term value creation and that many ways this is undermining basic tenets of American capitalism as more and more people -- choose and more and more -- more and more institutions, financial institutions, choose to invest in financial instruments, rather they're investing in lending to business institutions.\par \par \uc2 Matter of fact, I have seen some data that says as low as 15 percent of financial institutions -- activities are actually geared toward business -- supporting businesses, making investments in communities. We have clearly seen amongst public companies a shift from 80 percent in the 1980s where 50 percent of profits were reinvested back into plant and equipment and (ph) employees and (ph) R&D.\par \par \uc2 Now we are seeing 95 percent of corporate profits used for stock buybacks and dividends. We have seen\par \par \uc2 some of America's largest iconic tech firms with huge balance sheets still go into the markets, borrow\par \par \uc2 billions of dollars to use, not for R&D, but to use share buybacks.WARNER: I think there's an increasing consensus amongst CEOs and I think even some more sophisticated investors that this is long-term, destructive to real value creation in business and consequently to job growth.\par \par \uc2 Has the Fed and do you individually have any views on this challenge about short-termism (ph)? Is it a challenge in some of this movement, particularly amongst public companies, away from investing back in their businesses, back toward stock buyback and dividends? Prognosis here?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, we have looked very closely at investment spending and tried to understand why it has been so very depressed in the aftermath of the crisis. You know, I think one reason for it is simply that the economy's been growing slowly. Sales growth has been slow and many firms have found they actually don't need to invest very much in order to satisfy the demand growth that they're seeing.\par \par \uc2 The workforce has been expanding less quickly than it had been. When you have a rapidly expanding workforce firms need, they're hiring those people and they need to invest to equip new entrance with the tools to be productive that others already in the workforce has. Slowing in the workforce has also played a role, but beyond that, I mean, would agree with you that there's been...\par \par \uc2 WARNER: I would -- I would simply add there has been some level of activist investors who come in to say first thing you shutdown are your worker training programs, your investment in infrastructure, and I believe that is a negative long-term. I'll...\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I -- I would agree with you...\par \par \uc2 WARNER: I'll adhere to my five minute request, although I would ask for the public record that you come back. I am concerned on Section 165 on the living wills. We've got to move this process along. I am concerned about the level of disagreement between the Fed and the \uc2 FDIC\uc2 . So -- but I'll take that for the record so that other members can get their questions in.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Thank you, Senator Warner.\par \par \uc2 Senator Heller?\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. And Madam Chair, I want to thank you for being here today and thanks for taking time. I always find these to be very informative.\par \par \uc2 I want to go back to Brexit for just a minute. The chairman brought Brexit up and you also mentioned it in your opening comments. You said that the U.K. vote to exit the \uc2 European Union\uc2  would have significant economic repercussions. Can you go more into detail of what that means and perhaps what the plan of attack by the Feds are if, in fact, that were to pass two days from now?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So I said it could. I don't know that it would, but I think it could have significant economic consequences by launching a period of uncertainly, both for the United Kingdom and possibly the future of European economic integration. Most analyses suggest it would have negative economic consequences for the U.K. and spillover to Europe.\par \par \uc2 More broadly speaking, I think the financial market reaction to the uncertainties that would be unleashed by that decision could result in a kind of risk -- risk-off (ph) sentiment that we would see impacts on financial markets, that we might see flight to safety flows that could push up the dollar or other so-called safe haven currencies.\par \par \uc2 And I don't want to overblow the likely impacts, but we're aware of them. We will watch them and consider those impacts as we make future decisions on monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Is there any reason to believe that if Brexit were to pass, it -- that it would have an effect on the U.S. economy to the point that we'd go back into a recession?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I don't think that's the most likely case, but we just don't really know what will happen and we'll have to watch very carefully.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: What's the chance of the U.S. economy being in recession by the end of the year?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I think it's quite low. I think the U.S. economy is doing well. And although I've indicated that we're watching this recent slowdown in the job market carefully, my expectation is that the U.S.\par \par \uc2 economy will continue to grow. We have seen a pickup -- a strong pickup in consumer spending and growth in the economy. If the weakness in the labor market for the last couple of months was a reaction to earlier slowdown in growth, that looks to be reversing.\par \par \uc2 I remain optimistic in the kinds of conditions that have been associated in the past with U.S. recessions.\par \par \uc2 Often, that occurs when inflation is -- the economy is overheated, inflation has been quite high, the Fed has had to tighten monetary policy. We don't have any such conditions in play now. Households are in much improved shape.\par \par \uc2 And while there are negative influences in the economy, particularly on manufacturing stemming from slow growth abroad, the strong dollar, lower commodity prices, very seriously depressing hiring, causing\par \par \uc2 job loss in the energy sector and slowing investment in drilling and mining, still overall, the U.S. economy has been progressing even with those negatives. And I think the odds of a recession (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 certainly not what I expect.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Chairman, thanks for your answer.\par \par \uc2 A week ago, Friday, I think the 10-year yield on Japanese bonds and also German bonds were negative.\par \par \uc2 What impact does that have on our \uc2 Treasury\uc2  yields with these investors obviously looking for any kind return coming in to (ph) buying up our \uc2 Treasury\uc2  bonds? What kind of impact is that going to have on our yields?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So it does tend to induce capital inflows into the United States, which push down our \uc2 Treasury\uc2  yields, so ours are considerably higher. But in absolute terms, they're really quite low.\par \par \uc2 And differentials in the stance of monetary policy also put impacts on the value of the dollar. The dollar has gone up around 20 percent against a broad basket of currencies since mid 2014, and that's had a negative effect on our trade with the rest of the world and put downward pressure on corporate profits and hiring and manufacturing.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Are you concerned that it Feds raise rates, that -- that bond traders will ignore that, in fact reversing exactly what you're trying to achieve by raising rates?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, I think one of the factors that does influence bond pricing, if this is what you're referring to, is the anticipated path of rates. And there is some further increase built into market expectations, and often, the response of bond markets to what we do depends on how our -- how our actual actions compare with those expectations.\par \par \uc2 HELLER: Chairwoman, thank you. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 WARNER: Senator Warren?\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 It's good to see you again, Chair Yellen. I want to follow up on questions raised by Senator Corker and Senator Vitter. As you know, Dodd-Frank requires giant financial institutions to submit living wills, documents that describes how these giants could be liquidated in an orderly and rapid way in (ph) bankruptcy without either bringing down the economy or requiring a taxpayer bailout.\par \par \uc2 Now, a few months ago, the Fed and the \uc2 FDIC\uc2  jointly determined that the living will submitted by five of the biggest banks in the country were not credible and those banks must resolve the problems identified in their living wills by October 1st; that's 14 weeks from now. If the banks fail to do that, the Fed and the \uc2 FDIC\uc2  have the power to reduce the risks posed by these giant banks by, for example, raising higher capital standards or stricter leverage ratios.\par \par \uc2 These changes are critically important to avoiding another 2008 crisis, but the banks are unlikely to make them unless they believe that the Fed and the \uc2 FDIC\uc2  are serious about enforcing Dodd-Frank. Now, I know by law you must consider increasing capital and higher leverage ratios.\par \par \uc2 What I want today is to ask, can you commit that if any of these giant banks fail to resolve the problems in their living wills by October 1st that the Fed will use the tools that Congress gave you to reduce the risks posed by these too big to fail banks?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: We've been very serious in this review of living wills and we have clearly stated a set of well- identified changes that we want to see...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: I appreciate that.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: ... by October 1st.\par \par \uc2 Now, the decision about what we do if those deadlines are not met, those are decisions that my colleagues and I will need to look at very carefully, what is the appropriate sanction for doing that. But clearly, we are very serious about wanting to see these deficiencies remedied and well aware that wehave at our disposal the tools that you listed. So I cannot pre-commit today to tell you precisely what our response will be, and we will work closely with the \uc2 FDIC\uc2  as we have all along. But we are extremely serious about wanting to see progress and certainly will consider using those tools.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Well, as I said, you are required by law to consider them.\par \par \uc2 What I am asking for is a commitment here. I have to say, I don't fully understand why you would not make that commitment. The banks have known this was coming since Dodd-Frank was passed in 2010.\par \par \uc2 That is six years ago and they have been submitting living wills since 2013. There is no provision for all of the extensions that you have given them so far.\par \par \uc2 If any of the banks fail the credibility test on their fifth try, they need to face some real consequences.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise, why would they ever make changes if there were no consequences?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, there will be consequences.\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Well, I very much hope so.\par \par \uc2 You know, when you find that these five banks were submitting living wills that were not credible, you had said quite explicitly that, " that each of these remains too big to fail and if that anyone of them crashed, they would risk taking down the whole economy unless they got a government bailout." The entire goal of the living wills' process is to push the banks to fix this fundamental problem. I'm glad that the FED finally finally determined that some of these living wills were not credible. It will not mean anything if you're not willing to use the tools that Congress gave you to force these banks to reduce the risk that their pushing off onto the taxpayer.\par \par \uc2 A second issue I want to cover if I can briefly. And then I want to follow up on Senator Brown and Senator Menendez's questions about diversity. I think diversity is very important. There is a growing body of research showing for example, that gender diversity and leadership makes for stronger institutions. Perhaps it is not a coincident that there is a stunning lack of diversity at our biggest financial institutions, not a single one is led by a woman.\par \par \uc2 And while the Fed's leadership is somewhat more diverse, it's a not a whole lot better. Of the 12 Regional Fed President's, ten are men. Now as you know, Congressman Conyers and I, along with 120 of our colleagues sent a letter a few weeks ago about the lack of diversity among the Fed's leadership. And I appreciate the response that you sent us last week in which you acknowledged that greater diversity can help improve the Fed's decision making and that there is still work to be done to improve diversity among the Fed's leadership.\par \par \uc2 So let me just start by asking, does the lack of diversity among the Regional Fed Presidents concern you?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Yes, I believe it's important to have a diversified group of policymakers who can bring different perspectives to bare.\par \par \uc2 I think as you know it's the responsibility of the regional banks Class B and C directors to conduct a search, and to identify candidates. The board reviews those candidates and we insist that the search be national, and that every attempt be made to identify a diverse pool of candidate. We monitor those searches while they're ongoing to make sure that's been done...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: Let me just ask you then about the outcome here because, just as you say, under the law when a new regional Fed President is selected by the Regional Fed Board, that person must be approved by you and the others on the Board of Governors before taking office.\par \par \uc2 The Fed Board recently re-appointed each and every one of these Presidents without any public debate or any public discussion about it. So the question I have is, if you're concerned about this, why didn't you use either of these opportunities to say, "enough is enough, let's go back and see if we can find qualified regional presidents who also contribute to the overall diversity of the Fed's leadership?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, we did undertake a thorough review of the reappointments of the performance of the presidents.\par \par \uc2 The Board of Governors has oversight of the reserve banks. There are annual meetings between the Board's Bank Affairs Committee and the leadership of those banks to review the performance of the presidents, there were thorough reviews...\par \par \uc2 WARREN: You're telling me diversity is important and yet you just signed off on all these folks without any public discussion about it. I appreciate your commitment to diversity and I have no doubt about it. I don't question it.\par \par \uc2 It just shows me that the selection process for Regional Fed Presidents is broken because the current process has not allowed you and the rest of the board to address the persistent lack of diversity among the Regional Fed Presidents. I think that Congress should take a hard look at reforming the regional Fed selection process so that we can all benefit from a Fed leadership that reflects a broader array of both backgrounds and interests.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Thank you, Madam Chair.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Scott.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 Chair Yellen, thank you for being here today. I thank you for your hard work on behalf of all of America.\par \par \uc2 Frankly, you have a difficult task and one that will not get any easier before the year is out from my perspective.\par \par \uc2 I did find it quite interesting the opening comments of my good friend the Ranking Member, Senator Brown from Ohio as he seemed to suggest that the failure of the economy is somehow rests on the shoulder of my party. I thought to myself that, the American people aren't really looking to assign blame for why the economy is so anemic, and the so called recovery hasn't fully reached into those folks living paycheck to paycheck.\par \par \uc2 But it would be easier for them to remember that at the beginning of this recovery, that the Democrats, my good friends to left, controlled the White House, the Senate, and the House until early January 2011.\par \par \uc2 And what did they do with that trifecta? Actually, they created the most onerous regulatory state in the history of our country, and it continued until even last year when the administration proposed 80,000 plus pages of new regulations according to the \uc2 Competitive Enterprise Institute\uc2  for the economic impact. The cost of the economy of $1.85 trillion -- said differently that this anemic recovery -- perhaps it's anemic because of the regulatory burden created during those first couple of years.\par \par \uc2 I would suggest to you that people in my home state of South Carolina who are working paycheck to paycheck do not believe that we are actually have a strong recovery, and the numbers seem to bear that out. First time home-buyers down for the third consecutive year, and that disproportionately impacts African Americans who have home ownership around 45 percent. So the challenge seems to continue. Our economy grew the first quarter by 1.1 percent. We saw real income since 2007 decline by 6.5 percent. Americans eligible for food stamps is up 40 percent. Americans using food stamps are up 20 percent. Last month, we saw 38,000 jobs created and our labor force participation rate in 2007, 66.4 percent, 2010, bless you, 64.8 percent.\par \par \uc2 I've got to stop and say bless to the woman for sneezing. Is that OK with you sir? Thank you.\par \par \uc2 And in 2014 -- we're having fun up here because this is not a fun topic. In 2014, it was 62.9 percent, May of this year, 62.6 percent. I would suggest that the numbers themselves bear out the fact perhaps the anemic recovery is not a recovery for those folks working paycheck to paycheck. I don't know who is to blame but I can tell you that the American people want solutions more than blame.\par \par \uc2 My question is to is, as you look to the rest of this year, do you anticipate more months where the job creation number is 38,000 -- and the same month where we see job creation at 38,000, we celebrate a 4.7 percent unemployment rate only because 450,000 people stop looking for work? So when you take a real unemployment number based on the 2007 labor force participation rate, we would be at 9 percent.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So we do expect a thorough improvement in the coming year.\par \par \uc2 The unemployment rate fell substantially over the last year and there were jobs created in 2015 of about 225,000 or 300,000 a month. Perhaps we won't see job creation now that the economy is getting closer to estimates of normal longer run rate of unemployment. We may not see job creation at quite that pace but I expect continued improvement bringing down broader measures of unemployment which as you noted are much higher. Some include involuntary part-time employment. I expect further improvement unless (ph) the labor market continues to strengthen.\par \par \uc2 Now the last jobs report and the last couple of months of labor market performance were quite disappointing. My hope and expectations is that that's something that's temporary and we will that turn around in the coming months. Clearly it's something we will be watching very carefully. My expectation is that we will see improvement but we will watch it very carefully.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: My last question, as my time is running out, has to do with full employment and how to reach that wonderful goal of full employment. When I look at the numbers that are coming out of the need for skilled workers as well as STEM workers it appears that by 2020 we could have a shortfall of 3 million or 4 million folks in the skilled labor force, and about 5 million in the STEM labor force. My solution has a lot to do with the German model of apprenticeship programs. I'd love to hear if you have any solutions that you're going to be recommending as we look at the labor force participation rate, the number of skilled jobs that will be available and the need to get our workforce trained in that direction.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Going back probably to the mid-'80s we have seen a persistent shift in employment patterns from unskilled and people with middle skills but doing jobs that can be off-shored, outsourced, to skilled -- to demand for skilled labor.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: Yes, ma'am.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: The consequence of that has been rising inequality, a high return to education and downward pressure on the wages of those who are less skilled and middle income. I completely agree with you that education and training, perhaps apprenticeships of the type that are used in some European and other countries -- these are ideas that really have to be considered if we're going to address what comes out of that, which is that even when you have enough jobs you have downward pressure on the wages and incomes of people in the middle and the bottom of the skilled distribution.\par \par \uc2 SCOTT: Thank you, Chair Yellen. Mr. Chairman I would just suggest that at some point we are going to have to have a national conversation about the quality of education in our country and the necessity of a dual track. Back in my days we had shop which was an important part of our education apparatus and perhaps we need to have that conversation again. Thank you , Chair Yellen.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I agree with you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Donnelly?\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Chair Yellen. When you were here in February we talked about corporate offshoring and the devastating impact it's had on families in my home state of Indiana and in manufacturing towns across the country. The frustration remains. The decline in manufacturing employment is one of the factors that's led to a shrinking middle class.\par \par \uc2 We've two economies in this country. The overall economy might be doing well enough and the wealthy richer than ever, but middle and working class families aren't feeling the recovery. Wages have been stagnant for years. A recent Pew report said since 1971 each decade has ended with a smaller share of adults living in middle income households than at the beginning of the decade. What's the state of the economy for working families?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I would agree with you for decades now, as we were just discussing, there has been downward pressure on the incomes of less skilled individuals. And the kinds of jobs that once upon a time were pretty readily available, say for a high-school educated man in manufacturing, have gradually diminished. There's been a long term trend. Part of it is due to just the technological change that's consistently raised the demands for skilled workers and reduced the demands for less-skilled workers.\par \par \uc2 And I think globalization has also played some role.\par \par \uc2 More recently, slow growth in foreign economies, the strength of the dollar, which really is reflective of the U.S. doing better on balance than other countries, and...\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: I understand all these reasons, but these are real people, as you well know. There was an article not too long ago in the paper here about a fellow, he was making about $17 an hour at the plant.\par \par \uc2 He got fired because they shifted his job to Mexico for $3 an hour. But the ongoing ripple of that was that his daughter who had applied to \uc2 Indiana University\uc2 , I.U., got accepted. Found out that her dad was going to lose his job, she said, "I don't think the family can afford for me to go to college like that."\par \par \uc2 That's devastating. That's the future of America. That's what the real impact of all of this stuff is. It's just in the past few months. And these aren't because the companies aren't doing well. They're doing really well. But you know in a town next to my own town, Elkhart, 200 jobs shift overseas. That's 700 jobs, Huntington, Indiana, not the biggest county in the state. Shift to Mexico for $3 an hour wages. Fourteen hundred out of Indianapolis. Very profitable companies, and these folks are making $13, $14, $17 an hour.\par \par \uc2 As long as we have the mousetrap like this, how do we ever try to get the middle class up if even $13 an hour is too much in these companies' minds?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: These are very sad situations for...\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: They're wrong situations, is what they are.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: The kind of thing you're describing imposes terrible burdens on all too many American families.\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: SO how do we make America work for them?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Part of it is trying to make jobs which we can't stop all shifts occurring across sectors of the economy. I think we have to...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: Do you consider that a shift when a company is doing really well and somebody's making $13 an hour, not much above minimum wage, but lose their job because our laws allow them to ship them to Mexico for $3 an hour -- is that a shift? That's not really a shift in technology or anything, that's just a cold-blooded decision that Americans don't count as much as their profits.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Those forces have been in play for quite some time and for our part, at the Fed, we're trying to create a job market where there are enough vacancies and opportunities that people who lose jobs in one sector are able to find them in the sectors of our economy that are expanding. And sometimes to make that transition is difficult and may require retraining or other forms of help to connect with available job opportunities and sometimes we know that kind of job loss does cause long-lasting...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 DONNELLY: I'll just leave it like this. Gaming the system to want to make your product somewhere else in the hope that you can sell it back to here, to the United States, because you're hoping that other people will be happy to pay the $13 an hour, $14 an hour wages, so you'll have enough customers, you're just gonna game that so that you can pay the three bucks, and get your products back in here and it's like you get it on one end and you get it on the other end. And that just seems incredibly\par \par \uc2 irresponsible to me.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, Madam Chair.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Rounds.\par \par \uc2 ROUNDS: Thank you Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 Madam Chair, welcome. As I listen to your monetary policy report it strikes me that, as the Ranking Member had indicated earlier, we talk about productivity growth and the need for both public and private investment. That requires that the dollars come from someplace. And I'd like your thoughts on this, just in terms of -- on the basis what the joint economic committee had reported earlier this year and they laid it out in some pretty stark terms.\par \par \uc2 They indicated that 99 -- well let me put it this way. Ten years from now in the year 2026, which by the way is the 250th birthday of our country, we can look forward to, under current conditions, 99 percent of all the revenue coming into the federal government. Highway taxes, corporate taxes, personal taxes, personal income taxes, 99 percent of its going to go back out in two categories. Interest on the federal debt and mandatory payments on entitlements. That doesn't leave a lot for public investment and clearly does not drive private investment.\par \par \uc2 You're working on short-term activity right now and you're monitoring very closely, you're actually on a day-to- day basis following the economy right now, which as you suggested is doing very well and yet I think a lot of us would disagree. Three quarters of one percent growth on quarter hardly seems appropriate and I know that you're optimistic about the second being better, but even if it's double or even triple, we're not going to grow our way out of this crisis which is coming upon us.\par \par \uc2 I'd like your thoughts, because right now we're looking at areas in which, if we want those jobs to come back and if we want individuals or wages to rise, we're going to have to be in a position to where we actually grow this economy once again.\par \par \uc2 Tax policy, regulatory reform, actually managing our entitlements, all of which seem critical and yet today we haven't talked about that at all. We don't really seem to have a place where we can. Can you, as an impartial individual in this process who watches our economy grow or falter on a daily basis, can you talk to us about the need to do something now to avoid the crisis in 10 years?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, I think we all know, and have known for a long time that with an aging population and with healthcare costs that have by and large risen more rapidly than inflation, that we face the situation where we would have an unsustainable debt path and that this would require reforms as you say, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, those three programs will...\par \par \uc2 ROUNDS: So you're talking -- just to begin with, the Affordable Care Act needs to be reformed. That's part one.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well I didn't say anything about the Affordable Care Act, I am saying that the entitlement\par \par \uc2 programs need to be considered, how to put those on a sustainable basis.\par \par \uc2 ROUNDS: Would it be fair to say they need to be managed?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well they need to have Congress look at both revenues and the structure of expenditures to\par \par \uc2 ensure that those programs remains sustainable and the overall federal budget and debt associated\par \par \uc2 with that remain on a sustainable course because as you go out further with an aging population, as you\par \par \uc2 said, the debt to GDP ratio is rising simply unsustainably and that does require changes.\par \par \uc2 ROUNDS: Fair to say that, right now if, over the long term basis, every time the interest rate that we\par \par \uc2 have to pay at the federal level goes up by a quarter point, it's estimated that approximately a $50\par \par \uc2 billion a year additional increase in our costs being paid out. Looks to me like simply addressing and\par \par \uc2 beginning the process of slowing down the increasing federal debt and recognizing that we can't just\par \par \uc2 simply say over a one day period of time or a two day period of time that we've got all the answers.\par \par \uc2 Almost certainly, we're going to have to grow our way out of this as well as reducing some of the\par \par \uc2 ongoing expenditures. Fair to say?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: It certainly would be desirable if the U.S. economy were growing at a faster rate. You cited a very depressed number for first quarter growth. Over the last four quarters the average growth has been about two and a half -- two percent. In over eight quarters its been about two and a half percent, so sort of smoothing through the ups and downs we've been experiencing growth of two or two and a half percent...\par \par \uc2 ROUNDS: And that's -- we're not going to grow our way out based upon that number are we?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: We would certainly have to do better than that and that's a matter of productivity growth essentially being quite depressed relative to -- for example to the levels that we enjoyed in the second half of the 90's. So it's not certain what's responsible for that, but you know many factors come into play. We've had depressed levels of investment, we you know seem to have a depressed rate of business formation, the sort of technological change as it shows up in output gains seems to have fallen relative to those better times. And there are a range of policies we could consider to...\par \par \uc2 ROUNDS: Madam Chair, my time is up but it looks to me like what you're giving us is a wake up call about a crisis that isn't 10 years now, it's right now.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well it is a very serious matter that productivity growth is so slow yes, I want to highlight that. ROUNDS: Thank you Madam Chair, thank you Mr. Chairman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator (ph) Merkley.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Chair Yellen, thank you. Senator Donnelly was raising concern about manufacturing jobs in America and indeed our trade policy has given full access to our market to goods manufactured by companies in countries that do not have to abide by the same labor laws, the same wage rules, the same environmental rules or the same enforcement. This is a very unlevel playing field for American manufacturers that's having a devastating impact. The loss is extensive and is that really fair to the American worker to have American companies having to compete against companies that are allowed a completely different set of standards that lower their costs dramatically?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well I guess I would just say that in the view of most economists, more open trade creates net benefits, but that doesn't mean benefits for everyone and there are gainers but there are also losers and that's certainly...\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: The losers are the manufacturing workers. Again is that fair to the manufacturing workers?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well it's important to have policies that address the losses.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: Since mid-70's -- 1975 through now -- we've had four decades, in which virtually 100 percent of the new income has gone to the top 10 percent of Americans leaving basically nine out of 10 Americans in our economy out in the cold. This is substantially a reflection of the shift of manufacturing overseas. We've had a series of geostrategic decisions. We wanted to nurture the recovery of Japan, we wanted to pull China out of the Sino-Soviet bloc, now we want to pull the rest of Asia away from China.\par \par \uc2 Is there an understanding within the Fed how the cost of these geostrategic decisions upon the welfare of American families and through living wage jobs, the loss of living wage jobs?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: We have certainly looked at this question of wage- inequality, income-inequality, we collect data our survey of consumer finances is one of the key data sets that gives us insight into what's happening. Academic work on this topic, while it has focused to some extent on trade more broadly also looks at the importance of a phenomenon called skill-biased technical change that the nature of technological change in recent decades has continually shifted demand away from less skilled workers towards more skilled...\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: So let's take that as an additional factor -- technological change has occurred. However a lot of the shift overseas has been due to lower wages, not to technological change, in fact they've been rooting up our factory machines and shipping them overseas. So it's the same factories producing the same goods in a place that pays less. That is not technological change that is an issue of trade policy.\par \par \uc2 Technological change does have an impact so in a situation where as you point out, there's more higher skill demand -- demand for higher skilled jobs, education becomes very important.\par \par \uc2 But as compared to other developed economies, higher education be it higher skill training or college, is far more expensive. It is the single factor, more than healthcare that has gone up faster than inflation in our economy.MERKLEY: And such that not only is it daunting to our students, who in blue-collar communities like the one I live in, are getting the message that there is not an affordable path to fulfill their goals in life and statistically we see our students who do pursue that education burdened with debt that is having a profound impact both on delaying marriage and on delaying home ownership, which is the major -- has been a major engine of wealth for the middle class.\par \par \uc2 So we see this high cost of college and that seems to me like the type of structural concern in our economy that the Fed should be using its economic expertise to highlight the long-term devastating impacts of failing to provide the opportunity for the skills needed for the economy of the future. But I don't hear the Fed talking about that.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, we are looking at trends in student debt and believe we will be hosting a conference this fall on student debt and looking particularly at what it means for low and moderate income households.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: You know, I can't -- over these last few years, I've asked so many questions in which the response is always that's something we're looking at. It'd be nice to have a muscular (ph) representation of the big challenges to our economy because the Fed has the expertise to put its hands around that and be able to project that into the policy debate.\par \par \uc2 I'll just close, since my time is expiring, by saying one of those issues that I've raised multiple times is the Fed's power of the conflict of interest in commodities, the ability of large financial institutions to own pipelines, to own ships full of oil, to own energy generation stations, to own warehouses of aluminum.\par \par \uc2 And each time I hear we're looking at that, are we still looking at that? Are we actually going to do something about that?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: We're -- we -- we'll come out with a proposal on that. But some of it reflects decisions that Congress made and not Fed policy.\par \par \uc2 MERKLEY: That's true. There is -- there are some restrictions, but there's still considerable power resting with the Fed. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 WARNER: Senator Moran?\par \par \uc2 MORAN: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 Madam Chairwoman, thank you for joining us this morning. I would tell you that in my conversations with Kansans, very few -- I don't know if I've had a conversation with a Kansan who sees their economic future brighter. They see it -- they're more disillusioned. No one feels more secure in their job. No one feels like their children are going to have a brighter future.\par \par \uc2 Parents are concerned about their children's opportunities when they graduate from school, ability to pay back student loan -- loans. Worried about saving for their own retirement. People are worried about having enough income and savings to pay for healthcare emergencies. So the sense of an economic recovery is far from being felt universally with Kansans that I visit with across our state.\par \par \uc2 I wanted to just raise two questions. One, in part, that circumstance is related to significantly lower agriculture commodity prices, significantly lower prices in oil production, natural gas production, and part of that is a consequence of, I assume, the value of our dollar in comparison to other currencies and our ability to promote exports both of those -- certainly of agricultural commodities, although the law now allows for the export of oil as well.\par \par \uc2 Where are we in the value of our dollar? What's the intermediate expectations for us to be able to jump-start the sale of wheat, cattle, corn and other products, airplanes that are manufactured in our state that seemingly are not able to access those markets in part because the value of our currency?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So the value of the dollar has increased significantly since, say mid-2014. Partly, that reflects the fact that the U.S. has enjoyed a stronger recovery than many other advanced nations, and that's created an expectation that U.S. -- in the U.S., interest rates will rise at a more rapid pace than in other parts of the world, and that's induced inflows into our assets that have pushed up the dollar.\par \par \uc2 But more broadly, the trends you've seen in commodity prices I think reflect the larger set of global forces. In some cases, we've seen increases -- significant increases in the supply of commodities.\par \par \uc2 In the case of oil, the rapid growth of U.S. ability to supply oil markets has been a factor. And then there's been a slowdown in global growth and -- particularly in China, which has been an important consumer of so many commodities.\par \par \uc2 China's on a path and it's understood to be this will continue, a path of slowing growth and the plummet -- you've seen commodity prices plummet for many commodity prices just because of basic supply and demand considerations. The dollar makes some difference to that as well.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: And we often talk about -- when we talk about exports, trade agreements. Has the Fed weighed in, or have you expressed an opinion previously about other countries and their ability to manipulate currencies to our disadvantage of exports?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: The responsibility for currency policy rests with the secretary of the treasury.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: The Treasury Department.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: And we don't weigh in on that.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: Madam Chairwoman, let me ask you about something in your testimony. You indicate that business investment outside the energy sector was surprisingly weak.\par \par \uc2 Would you indicate to me, elaborate on the factors that lead you to that statement? And when you exclude the energy sector, is that just because of definition or is something happening in the energy sector that indicates investment?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, drilling activity has been very important, and it has counted as part of investment activities. So, with the huge plunge in oil prices, even though there has been some recovery, we have seen a number of rigs in operation just plummet, and that's part of why aggregate investment spending has been so weak.\par \par \uc2 And we understand that and expect it, because it reflects the decline in oil prices. But even when we go outside the energy sector, or other energy sectors that are directly related to energy and supplying inputs to it, investment spending recently -- and this is just a report on the data, it's -- I don't have a story to offer you on why this has happened.\par \par \uc2 It has been surprisingly weak over the last several months. It hasn't been very strong -- investment spending -- generally. We talked about this earlier during the recovery, but it has been -- and we think we understand some reasons why it has generally been weak, namely, slow growth and less rapid increase in the labor force. But it has been surprisingly weak in recent months, and it's something we're watching. And I don't -- I can't tell you just what that's due to.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: I wouldn't expect you to say this, but in my view, in part that lack of investment or that reduction in investment is related to a wide -- an array of circumstances. One of them would be the debt and deficit, the uncertainty of our economy. Lack of economic growth.\par \par \uc2 Generally, the economic indicators are downtrending, not uptrending a sufficient number of times to instill a sense of confidence. The next regulation that may come their way, as a business person, just decisions to make investments, people are deciding it's more risky to invest than to not.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, those issues are certainly mentioned by business people. In recent quarters, corporate earnings have also been under downward pressure for a variety of reasons.\par \par \uc2 MORAN: Well, I -- I would conclude my remarks by indicating that one of the places we ought to focus attention is on innovation, startups business and entrepreneurs. And the uncertainty they face is even more of a dramatic -- has a dramatic consequence than a larger business that can better internalize and handle that uncertainty.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Thank you, Chairwoman.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Senator Cotton.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: Thank you. And thank you, Chair, for being forced again. I know these are always two highlights of every year for you.\par \par \uc2 I want to return to some of the earlier discussion of the so- called Brexit, the referendum that will occur in the United Kingdom on Thursday on whether Great Britain should remain or leave the E.U.\par \par \uc2 Your testimony on page four says, quote, "One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions."\par \par \uc2 "Could," which you stressed to Senator Heller in his comments. That sounds to me like the usual prudence and caution you use in all of your public statements.\par \par \uc2 You also stated to Senator Heller, quote, "I don't want to overblow the likely impacts," end quote. That reminds me of Yogi Berra's old sage advice that predictions are hard, especially about the future.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: That's absolutely true. I couldn't agree with that more.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: Yet in the last few minutes, here's how the Guardian of London reports your testimony to the committee. Quote, "Yellen warns on Brexit."\par \par \uc2 Not exactly what you said, is it?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I said that we're monitoring it and it could have consequences with the (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 COTTON: But you couldn't -- you wouldn't characterize your testimony as a warning on the Brexit?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I have in this -- if that means I am warning U.K. residents -- I am not attempting to take a stand, they're going to go to the polls. They have had an active debate on the issues and I am not providing advice in that sense.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: Good. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 I sympathize when headlines don't exactly capture the exact meaning of what one says -- and to be fair to the Guardian, they're not the only outlet that's reported your testimony along those lines, the BBC, Reuters, CNBC and Fortune have as well. So to be crystal clear, you take no position on whether U.K. citizens should vote to remain or leave the E.U.? And the Federal Reserve doesn't take no position?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: That's correct. That's for them to decide. I'm simply saying the decision could have economic consequences that would be relevant to the U.S. Economic Outlook that we need to monitor carefully.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: Thank you for that because I certainly think we all in America, and particularly in positions of leadership in our government, should respect the British people's sovereign right to govern their own affairs.\par \par \uc2 One point you made in your earlier comments about Brexit, about the potential source of these economic repercussions is, quote, "a period of uncertainty." That's something I hear frequently in commentary about the Brexit. Is there any time when the global economy or U.S. economy doesn't operate in a condition of uncertainty?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, there is uncertainty but this is a unique event that has no close parallel. It's hard to know what the consequences would be, of course, there is always uncertainty domestically and globally. We operate in an uncertain environment.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: Many of your counterparts in the continent, many of my elected counterparts in the continent have not treated the matter so evenhandedly. They've opined on what the British citizens should do.\par \par \uc2 They have also been responsible for other things that have caused uncertainties in recent years like Greek Debt Crisis, or other debt crises in Europe, or the suspension of the Schengen Zone privileges because of the flow of migrants into Europe -- and terrorists now infiltrating that flow and launching attacks in Paris just a few blocks away from the heart of the European union. Those have also potentially caused periods of uncertainty in the European and global economy, wouldn't they?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Absolutely.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: Is there a risk that some of the dire predictions about Brexit could become or the reaction to the Brexit could be a self- fulfilling prophecy in the economy?\par \par \uc2 Some British politicians have promised, or perhaps I should say threatened immediate tax increases or budget cuts if the U.K. citizens vote to leave. Some continental leaders have threatened punitive or retaliatory reaction if U.K votes to leave. Our own president has said that the United Kingdom would have to, quote, "go to the back of the queue," end quote for any new trade agreement. Do these statements have the potential for creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that would lead to increased uncertainty whatever the outcome on Thursday?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: I don't want to comment what various participants in this debate have said or the advice they've given the British people. There is an active debate. It's not appropriate with a decision of this sort for many parties to weigh in about the consequences.\par \par \uc2 As I said, I'm not trying to offer advice myself to the U.K. residents about to go to the polls.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: Thank you, nor am I.\par \par \uc2 One final point, your counterpart at the ECB has said that the ECB is quote, "ready for all contingencies following the U.K.'s E.U. Referendum," end quote. Can you say the same thing about the Federal Reserve -- you're ready for all contingencies following the vote Thursday?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, in the sense that we will closely monitor what the economic consequences -- would be and are prepared to act in light of that assessment.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: And should the U.K. vote to leave the E.U., the United States as a whole and the Federal Reserve will handle that contingency in the spirit of magnanimity, generosity, and friendship among nations?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Well, it would certainly be my inclination to do so.\par \par \uc2 COTTON: Thank you for that.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Madam chairwoman, I want to shift the conversation a little bit to custody banks, which are very important. I think that would be banks like State Street, New York Mellon and I'm sure others. It's been reported that custody banks have turned away deposits or are charging fees on deposits because of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio.\par \par \uc2 You've received public comments stating that the rule could limit the ability of custody banks to accept deposits, particularly during periods of stress.\par \par \uc2 Is the Fed currently examining how this rule is impacting custody banks' ability to accept deposits? One.\par \par \uc2 Two, could this rule increase systemic risk during times of stress?\par \par \uc2 And three, just for the audience, they probably know, what is a custody bank as opposed to ordinary retail bank?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: So a custody bank is one that handles transactions for other customers...\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Very important.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: ...asset managers.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: A custody bank's important to the banking system, is it not?\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: Yes, they are.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Okay.\par \par \uc2 YELLEN: And I -- we certainly are aware that they're concerned about the supplementary leverage ratio impacting their profitability. Leverage ratios are normally intended to be a backup form of capital regulation. They're not oriented toward the risk of particular assets on the balance sheet, but impose a minimum amount of capital that applies to the entire balance sheet. All assets.\par \par \uc2 And so for safe assets in banks that hold particularly safe, large quantities of safe assets, it can be a burden. And it's something that we will monitor. But this is the way leverage ratios have always been imposed against all of the assets of the overall size of the organization.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Thank you. Senator Brown, do you have anything else (ph)?\par \par \uc2 BROWN: No, that's it (ph). Thank you.\par \par \uc2 SHELBY: Madam Chair, thank you for your participation. I know it's been long, but I thank you for you appearing before the committee again. The committee is adjourned.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160621ec6l00bq9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 It is a technology so new that many people in finance cannot explain what it is or what it might be able to do \u8212\'20\'14 yet they know they might have to worry about it.\par \par \uc2 Demand from professionals for learning about blockchain, the technology that powers the virtual currency {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/intl/indepth/bitcoin"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bitcoin}}}\uc2 , is so great that Cambridge university plans to offer courses to executives about its disruptive potential this year.\par \par \uc2 Blockchain has been the subject of a significant amount of hype over the past year as institutions ranging from banks, exchanges, insurers and governments have rushed to work out how blockchain could be used, by them or rivals. The technology deployed is known as a distributed database, which runs from many computers and needs no central authority.\par \par \uc2 Cambridge\u8217\'20\'19s Centre for Alternative Finance, based at its \uc2 Judge Business School\uc2 , will be the first in the UK to teach the subject, with demand coming mainly from employees of global banks.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNobody wants to be \uc2 Kodak\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D says Robert Wardrop, executive director of the school\u8217\'20\'19s centre for alternative finance, comparing the film-maker\u8217\'20\'19s failure to adapt to the digitisation of photography to the change in the banking sector.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey [bankers] all know their industry is being digitalised, how you develop a competitive response\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09that is the challenge,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Wardrop says. \u8220\'20\'1CDo you do nothing, collaborate or compete?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Advocates believe that though blockchain is at an early stage in its development, it has the potential to disrupt many sectors. This is because it is transparent, indelible and tamper-proof and is jointly run by several parties. It could be used to keep records such as on a person\u8217\'20\'19s complete health or insurance history, for example. Or it could be used for cross-border clearing and settlement.\par \par \uc2 Cambridge\u8217\'20\'19s teaching about blockchain and digital currencies will be a core part of its educational programme on fintech, which is being developed by the Centre for Alternative Finance. Professors will also cover peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, alternative investments and new forms of credit \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . The material will be included in the university\u8217\'20\'19s master of finance programme this summer.\par \par \uc2 The introduction of the Cambridge course comes after several US universities that had added bitcoin to their syllabuses in 2014 shifted their attention to blockchain.\par \par \uc2 David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University\u8217\'20\'19s Stern School of Business, says there is great interest in the quandaries posed by emerging technology to regulators. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are huge challenges for most governments around the world because they assume the current law will deal with a lot of blockchain issues,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CBut it is a totally different animal.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Professor Yermack predicts that a technological evolution will shrink the size of the industry\u8217\'20\'19s workforce overall, but in doing so it will create many specialist tech jobs.\par \par \uc2 Stern School will teach its MBA students about digital currencies, blockchains and their growing place in the financial services industry from next spring. It also plans a course for executives. At Duke University\u8217\'20\'19s Fuqua School of Business, emphasis has also shifted away from bitcoin. Duke says its innovation and cryptoventures course, which is part of the MBA, has been heavily oversubscribed and is aimed at students who want to create their own blockchain start-ups. \uc2 Campbell Harvey\uc2 , finance professor at Fuqua, says: \u8220\'20\'1CNow it\u8217\'20\'19s the general technology called blockchain. There are apps that go with it, bitcoin is one of them.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Universities are mostly teaching the basics of blockchain: the context of how the technology came about, its mechanics and how people are trying to commercialise and innovate with it.\par \par \uc2 Garrick Hileman, who teaches blockchain and virtual currencies at Cambridge, says that for more than two years he has seen \u8220\'20\'1Ctremendous\u8221\'20\'1D interest from companies. He has been called in to teach executives informally about bitcoin and other virtual currencies such as ether, and more recently, blockchain. \u8220\'20\'1CMany people are still trying to understand the basics,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Blockchain\u8217\'20\'19s reputation has suffered from its association with bitcoin, which has been tarnished by the collapse of Mt Gox \u8212\'20\'14 a prominent exchange, with the disappearance of $500m worth of customers\u8217\'20\'19 bitcoins \u8212\'20\'14 and the closure by US authorities of the Silk Road website, which facilitated the sale of illegal drugs.\par \par \uc2 But part of what attracted executives to the potential of distributed databases was seeing how well bitcoin performed as it attracted users around the world. Launched in 2008, bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s market value now stands at more than $10bn, according to Coindesk, which tracks bitcoin data.\par \par \uc2 While the new Cambridge course will teach key concepts \u8212\'20\'14 such as what blockchain is and how it is being experimented with \u8212\'20\'14 it will not go in depth into the complex cryptographic processes that would be more suited to a computer science course.\par \par \uc2 Manfred Alfonso Dasenbrock, an executive at Brazilian co-operative Sicredi, who attended a fintech course at Cambridge in September, says: \u8220\'20\'1CThe way we do banking business will not be the same in a few years.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020160620ec6k000xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 The biggest banking lobby group in the US is raising concerns about a radical shake-up of accounting rules that would force banks to recognise losses on loans \u8212\'20\'14 starting on the day they are originated.\par \par \uc2 Under the current regime, banks can hold off adding to reserves until the point at which losses on the loan become probable. But under the new rule, finalised last week, banks will be made to log all expected losses over the life of the loan on day one, based on a combination of experience, their own forecasts and the current state of the economy.\par \par \uc2 The US standard-setter, the \uc2 Financial Accounting Standards Board\uc2 , describes the overhaul as the most significant for the banks in more than 40 years. According to \uc2 FASB\uc2 , the new standard \u8212\'20\'14 which can be adopted in 2019, before it becomes mandatory in 2020 \u8212\'20\'14 could help to rein in the kind of behaviour seen in the years leading up to the financial crisis, when the banks pumped out new loans even as they ran down their allowances for losses. That presented a flattering picture of the banks\u8217\'20\'19 books, according to \uc2 FASB\uc2 , and magnified the trouble that was to come as many of the loans turned bad.\par \par \uc2 But bank lobbyists are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bankingjournal.aba.com/2016/06/fasb-issues-final-loan-loss-accounting-standard/#_ga=1.170466786.359529094.1466106677"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 chafing against }}}\uc2  the rule change, warning that the upfront assessment of likely losses could act as a deterrent to lending by forcing banks to weigh the potential risks more closely than before. In addition, said Michael Gullette, vice-president of accounting and financial management at the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2 , the longer-term nature of the forecast could introduce more volatility to profits and capital levels, as banks tweak their estimates from year to year.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CChanges in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.aba.com/Issues/Index/Documents/CECL-implementation-challenges-discussion-paper.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 assumptions }}}\uc2  can mean the difference between paying a dividend or not, so you\u8217\'20\'19re going to need pretty good support for these things,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Although the new standard is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20160617b1.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 final }}}\uc2 , the ABA hopes to shape the way it is implemented between now and 2019. The Washington DC-based group describes itself as the voice of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s banking industry, representing lenders that together keep $12tn in deposits and extend more than $8tn in loans.\par \par \uc2 Hal Schroeder, a board member at \uc2 FASB\uc2 , said the new rule \u8212\'20\'14 known as the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL \u8212\'20\'14 is simpler and cleaner, because it \u8220\'20\'1Caligns the accounting with the economics of underwriting, and the informational needs of investors\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 He noted that in the four years leading up to the crisis, loans held by banks in the US increased 45 per cent, while reserves set aside for losses fell 10 per cent. That meant that loan-loss reserves as a percentage of gross loans \u8212\'20\'14 an important measure of the banks\u8217\'20\'19 resilience \u8212\'20\'14 were near a multi-decade low on the eve of the Lehman collapse.\par \par \uc2 The existing regime did not work as intended, agreed Chris Henkel, a consultant at Moody\u8217\'20\'19s \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  in New York. \u8220\'20\'1CIt did little to show the true extent of the credit risk inherent in a bank\u8217\'20\'19s loan portfolio,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160620ec6k003jt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Pimco, the bond fund manager, is laying off 3 per cent of its global staff as it continues to shrink in the wake of the departure of founder Bill Gross.Affected employees \u8211\'20\'13 the majority in business rather than investment roles \u8211\'20\'13 were told earlier today, reports Stephen Foley in New York.\par \par \uc2 The company said it employed 2,300 people at the end of March, after trimming the workforce slowly since Mr Gross\u8217\'20\'19s departure in September 2014 by not replacing staff who leave.\par \par \uc2 The company said that it had moved on to compulsory layoffs, in a statement issued today.\par \par \uc2 The FT has obtained the internal memo sent to staff by Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer, Doug Hodges, chief executive, and Jay Jacobs, president. Read in full below:\par \par \uc2 Colleagues,\par \par \uc2 Earlier today the Executive Committee directed a series of steps to ensure that our business is better structured to serve our clients in this fast-changing asset management industry landscape. We want to share this news with you now that we have connected with our colleagues who are affected.\par \par \uc2 As a primary step, we have taken the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by 68 people. We have always strived to hire top talent, so those who are now leaving are colleagues who have given tremendously to PIMCO and our clients. We pride ourselves on being a lean organization with a special culture, so that only makes this decision even more difficult and personal for us as a firm. While this reduction represents just 3 percent of our workforce, the changes are especially painful given the close bonds that all of us forge with one another as colleagues and friends. We thank all those who are leaving for their many contributions and we will miss them.\par \par \uc2 Secondly, we will be offering voluntary severance to eligible employees in the US. Those eligible will be contacted later today by HR. Separation terms will be determined by reference to local custom and regulations.\par \par \uc2 Finally, we have decided to restructure our active Dividend strategies by converting the equity exposure to Research Affiliates Equity Income (RAE Income). While our Dividend team colleagues have made important contributions to the firm, we believe this conversion is a better outcome for clients as we seek consistent performance with a lower risk profile, while delivering on the objectives of high current yield and long-term capital appreciation. As a result, the dividend team will be among our colleagues referenced above who are leaving the firm.\par \par \uc2 Here is why we are taking these measures: We remain committed to first caring for the assets that clients have entrusted to us. We also see growth potential in a range of areas including alternatives, private credit, solutions, client \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and regionally in many parts of the world, not to mention the increasing investor demand for many of our non-traditional strategies. We know that the role of active management has never been more important to client portfolios. The competitive demands of this industry require that we continually adapt and innovate to meet evolving client needs. Therefore, everything we do is focused on providing investment performance, innovative solutions for clients and outstanding client service.\par \par \uc2 Of note, as we collectively move forward as a firm, we will continue to build out teams and hire the best talent globally and manage our staff levels through attrition, hiring, repositioning of resources and through promotion and compensation. We have undertaken an extensive benchmarking exercise this year to compare our compensation with competitors and will use this to remain a top payer in our industry.\par \par \uc2 Taking these actions today positions all of us for the future. We will use our substantial resources to invest in you and add to our already remarkable talent where necessary.\par \par \uc2 Today is a difficult day for all of us at PIMCO, but most importantly, for those affected by these decisions.

While Pimco has been working to familiarise clients with a younger generation of star managers, it has also been struggling against concerns over the future direction of fixed income markets, where rising interest rates could hurt core bond portfolios in particular.\par \par \uc2 The company has lost market share to rivals such as MetWest and DoubleLine, while a \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  bond market tracker fund last year stole Pimco\u8217\'20\'19s title as the world largest fixed income fund.\par \par \uc2 The internal memo went on: \u8220\'20\'1CWe see growth potential in a range of areas including alternatives, private credit, solutions, client \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and regionally in many parts of the world, not to mention the increasing investor demand for many of our non-traditional strategies.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The rise of low-cost index funds and a growing disillusionment with high fees have roiled the industry, and there have been cost cuts at many firms, particularly those focused on active fund management.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  laid off 400 staff earlier this year, and \uc2 Franklin Resources\uc2  has set cost-cutting targets in response to big outflows. GMO, the Boston-based fund manager run by Jeremy Grantham, has also cut 10 per cent of its 650-person staff, according to a research report on the firm by \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160616ec6g00cnl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The firm, according to the memo, will trim some of its equity funds and partner with Newport Beach-based Research Affiliates, LLC, on the management of some stock portfolios.\par \par \uc2 Pimco also is offering voluntary severance to other U.S. employees. The cuts amount to 3% of Pimco's roughly 2,300 employees.\par \par \uc2 The firm managed $1.5 trillion in assets at the end of March.\par \par \uc2 Fox Business Network\uc2  first reported the layoffs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLike any responsible business, Pimco constantly adjusts its resources to capitalize on changing markets and investment opportunities for clients," a spokesman said.

It added that the banks could cover most of this requirement by issuing so-called contingent convertible debt, designed to turn into equity if a bank's capital levels fall beneath a designated level.\par \par \uc2 UBS\uc2  said in a statement that while it disagrees \u8220\'20\'1Cwith a number of depictions" in the report, it \u8220\'20\'1Cdoes not point out anything materially new." \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 John Letzing\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160617ec6g001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The firm, according to the memo, will trim some of its equity funds and partner with Newport Beach-based Research Affiliates, LLC on the management of some stock portfolios.\par \par \uc2 Pimco also is offering voluntary severance to other U.S. employees. The cuts announced Thursday amount to 3% of Pimco's roughly 2,300 employees. The firm managed $1.5 trillion in assets at the end of March.\par \par \uc2 Fox Business Network\uc2  first reported the layoffs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLike any responsible business, Pimco constantly adjusts its resources to capitalize on changing markets and investment opportunities for clients," a spokesman said. He added that the plan would cut costs in some areas and allow for investments and new hires in other parts of the business. He confirmed the contents of the memo.\par \par \uc2 Pimco is looking to expand in private credit, alternatives and client \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the memo said.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Research Affiliates declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 As part of the equity changes, Pimco will close six funds with about $260 million in assets. That amount represents less than 1% of the firm's stock assets under management, the spokesman said. The head of Pimco's dividend team, Brad Kinkelaar, will leave the firm as part of those changes.\par \par \uc2 Pimco in 2014 made a push into equities but has since closed some funds and several leaders in the business have departed. It currently manages about $40 billion.\par \par \uc2 The firm has suffered investor withdrawals in recent years following several leadership changes at the firm. Co-founder \uc2 Bill Gross\uc2  abruptly left in September 2014 and investors have pulled billions from the flagship fund he managed.\par \par \uc2 Firms that have long focused on active management have also been under pressure from growing investor taste for passive funds that track the performance of indexes.\par \par \uc2 Write to Sarah Krouse at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:sarah.krouse@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sarah.krouse@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160616ec6g007pt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 For the better part of a century, there's been a clear separation between the ownership and the management of publicly traded companies. Most shareholders haven't individually owned enough stock or had the expertise to credibly demand a say in decision-making. As a result, most owners have been passive; if they disagree with the direction of a company, their only option has been to sell.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://graphics.wsj.com/image-grid/future-of-everything/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 More Future of Everything}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/are-slot-machines-about-to-get-smart-1465997822"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Are Slot Machines About to Get Smart?}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-next-for-artificial-intelligence-1465827619?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 What's Next for \\b Artificial Intelligence\\b0 }}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-who-greenlighted-game-of-thrones-on-televisions-future-1465827910"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Man Who Greenlighted \u8216\'20\'18Game of Thrones' on Television's Future}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://graphics.wsj.com/image-grid/future-of-everything/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Future of Everything: June 2016}}}\par \par \uc2 But all that is changing. First, institutional shareholders have gotten bigger, and their ownership of corporate America has become more concentrated. These institutions invest the savings of many Americans, and the amount they manage has swelled. Second, many of these institutional shareholders have developed deep industry expertise, truly understanding the industries in which they invest. Third, poor performance by management and outright cases of abuse of power and even fraud have created a mindset among shareholders that management teams have lost their right to be left alone. Lastly, there are a few shareholders, commonly known as \u8220\'20\'1Cactivists" but whom I call \u8220\'20\'1Chighly engaged shareowners," who are galvanizing their fellow shareholders and providing the catalyst for management to be held accountable.\par \par \uc2 Critics have accused so-called activists of advocating business decisions that create a short-term bump in stock prices at the expense of the company's long-term health, and some politicians would like to legislate against the rising influence of shareholders, claiming that it leads to short-termism, rising inequality and low pay for workers.\par \par \uc2 But in my view, the management and directors of public companies, not the shareholders, have driven such short-term behavior, and the way to build strong companies and create jobs is not through government mandate or protecting weak management teams. It will happen because market forces will reward the companies in which management teams and highly engaged shareowners work together to achieve sustained, lasting growth.\par \par \uc2 There's no going back: Public shareowners are becoming more involved, more informed and more engaged. That will lead to better long-term growth and performance, a win-win for all constituencies, including customers, employees, shareholders and management.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160615ec6f0050m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Sapho has raised $9.5 million in Series A funding to back its software tools for enterprise app development.\par \par \uc2 Alsop Louie Partners\uc2  led the new funding, which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/pro/venturecapital"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Sapho}}}\uc2  will use to expand its sales and marketing team. SoftTech VC and Caffeinated Capital also contributed to the round, which closed in January. Other investors include Morado Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures and \uc2 Bloomberg Beta\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sapho's Micro App Platform allows enterprise app development teams to build apps supporting their internal workflow, including functions ranging from human resources to license management to financial data.\par \par \uc2 The San Francisco-based company aims to distinguish itself from competitors by bringing to enterprise apps the alerting features that have become popular in consumer technology like push notifications. Sapho uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to learn which events are important, and alert users to them, said Chief Executive Fouad ElNaggar.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn your personal life, computers tell you if someone's tagged you, or if there's something you should be interested in. We're trying to bring that to work," said Peter Yared, Sapho's chief technology officer. The strategy complements what industry analysts describe as the \u8220\'20\'1Cconsumerization" of enterprise technology, as enterprise users gravitate toward easy-to-use software that borrows features from popular consumer tech.\par \par \uc2 Sapho charges its enterprise customers on a subscription basis per active user within their company. Its customers include \uc2 Turner Broadcasting Company\uc2 , \uc2 CBS Interactive\uc2 , Kubernetes and PRX Corporation. The company has raised a total of $13.5 million to date.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160615ec6f003mo\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Woodford Equity Income, which has \u163\'00\'A38.7bn of assets, primarily invests in companies that deliver sustainable dividend growth.\par \par \uc2 Mr Hollands said: \u8220\'20\'1CImperial Innovations is entirely suited to the Patient Capital Trust. Eight of [the fund\u8217\'20\'19s] top 10 holdings are in the healthcare sectors, including three unquoted companies.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWoodford Equity Income, in contrast, offers \u8216\'20\'18exposure to companies that can deliver sustainable dividend growth and aiming to deliver attractive, positive long-term returns and a growing income stream\u8217\'20\'19. A stock like this doesn\u8217\'20\'19t naturally fit with that description.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Darius McDermott\uc2 , managing director at \uc2 Chelsea Financial\uc2 , a fund supermarket, added that the technologies used by many of the companies backed by \uc2 Imperial Innovations\uc2  remained \u8220\'20\'1Cunproven\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 But he added: \u8220\'20\'1CNeil is a really big believer in the underlying technologies\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09If he really likes an idea, he will own a big chunk of it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Woodford Investment Management\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 However, a spokesperson pointed to a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://woodfordfunds.com/blog/mission-possible/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recent Woodford Investment Management blog }}}\uc2  by analyst Lucinda Crabtree in which she highlighted a company backed by \uc2 Imperial Innovations\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 Mission Therapeutics \u8212\'20\'14 as \u8220\'20\'1Cincredibly exciting\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Ms Crabtree said the company, which is developing technology to treat oncology-related conditions and neurodegenerative illnesses such as Parkinson\u8217\'20\'19s disease, stood out.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe strongly believe innovation such as this will have tremendous commercial potential in the future,\u8221\'20\'1D she wrote.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160613ec6d00899\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

US investment banks have achieved their own victory in Europe in recent years, occupying four out of the top five spots for fees earned , according to \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group Coalition.\par \par \uc2 Whether bankers at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2  are oversexed is for other pundits to judge. But it is questionable whether the banks themselves are overpaid. European clients shell out fees that are 18 per cent lower than those in the US.\par \par \uc2 European investment bankers, lacking a credible international champion of their own, tend to regard the disparity as unfair. They argue it is easy for Americans to muscle into their market, brought up to fighting weight by domestic fees as high as 7 per cent for a flotation. But charges may be high because US customers are insensitive to price, rather than because there is a cartel. The greater wonder is that European companies are so value-conscious over deals that may matter critically. One theory is that loss-leading privatisation mandates set Europe's fees artificially low in the '80s.\par \par \uc2 High US fees might equally be a cultural quirk. Some Americans wear turtleneck sweaters under their shirts and think Seth Rogen is funny.\par \par \uc2 Either way, the horrid truth Europeans should recognise is that US investment banks are successful here because they deserve to be. Their advice is no worse than local rivals, their distribution will often be better and they have big economies of scale.\par \par \uc2 Their commitment to staying in the business wins them clients and talented staff. Brands such as \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2  were well known in the City at the time of Big Bang three decades ago. British investment banking names like Barings, Kleinwort Benson and SG Warburg were big back then but are now largely historic footnotes.\par \par \uc2 US customers and stockholders should regard the implicit subsidy they provide to the European clients of Wall Street banks as a form of the Marshall Aid, which, after D-Day, helped rebuild a ravaged continent. The locals weren't notably grateful for that, either.\par \par \uc2 jonathan.guthrie@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160610ec6a00018\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14White House officials met privately with regulators and leaders in the financial technology industry Friday to discuss how the government can work with innovators.\par \par \uc2 The half-day event called the \u8220\'20\'1CFinTech Summit" largely focused on how government agencies can tap into the innovation, in which new firms are offering small-business owners and consumers faster forms of loans and digital payments. Federal regulators have been studying the industry to determine how it can be regulated while still encouraging innovation.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the White House took it a step further by inviting some of those regulators and key players \u8220\'20\'1Cto discuss how fintech can help advance critical economic policy priorities," Adrienne Harris, special assistant to the president for economic policy, wrote in a blog post following the event.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTechnology isn't just changing the financial services industry, it's changing the way consumers and business owners relate to their finances, and the way institutions function in our financial system," said Ms. Harris, who led the event. \u8220\'20\'1CFrom consumers' financial health to growing and managing small businesses; from cybersecurity to helping developing nations prosper; and from \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  to blockchain\u8212\'20\'14we spent the day identifying those areas where partnership across industries and between the public and private sectors can help advance our financial well-being and economic prosperity."\par \par \uc2 The summit, which was closed to the news media, included officials from the Treasury Department, the \uc2 Small Business Administration\uc2 , and leaders in both fintech and traditional banking.\par \par \uc2 Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker led a panel discussion on the government's role in fintech and how those firms are partnering with each other and banks. The Commerce Department recently kicked off its own \u8220\'20\'1Cinnovation" series in which Ms. Pritzker met with fintech companies to encourage public-private partnerships.\par \par \uc2 Other speakers included Marla Blow, a former top official at the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  who helped start FS Card Inc., a fintech credit-card company with a focus on subprime borrowers. Ms. Blow spoke on the \u8220\'20\'1Cchanging landscape of financial services," according to an agenda obtained by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 Summit participants also discussed the \u8220\'20\'1C\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 " report released by the White House in May that addressed how such data can be used to offer credit to underserved consumers but also poses civil rights and privacy risks. Roy Austin, deputy assistant to the president for urban affairs, led that discussion, examining how fintech firms use such data.\par \par \uc2 The event concluded with a discussion on how fintech firms are a \u8220\'20\'1Cpotent enabler" for developing countries. The conversation was led by \uc2 Gayle Smith\uc2 , the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMobile phone-based payment systems are making vulnerable communities more resilient, allowing governments to operate more transparently," Ms. Harris wrote. She also said they could be the foundation for businesses in remote areas \u8220\'20\'1Cso that households living beyond the electricity grids in East Africa can access clean energy for the first time and Indian villages can develop sustainable water systems."\par \par \uc2 The panel concluded that the public and private sectors need \u8220\'20\'1Cto align around a common vision and work together to lay the foundations for modern, inclusive economies," Ms. Harris said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Rachel Witkowski at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:rachel.witkowski@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rachel.witkowski@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160610ec6a00af3\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 One of the causes of the global financial crisis \u8212\'20\'14 and there were many \u8212\'20\'14 was just outright fraud.\par \par \uc2 Fraud when US subprime mortgages were being written; fraud when those mortgages were being packaged into bonds; and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/02/bubbles-and-fraud"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 fraud again }}}\uc2  when those bonds were being sold to investors.\par \par \uc2 For example, banks would hire a company to check if loans they were securitising were dodgy, but wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t disclose the results of that review to end investors. The reason for this secrecy, as Felix Salmon discussed in a 2010 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/10/13/the-enormous-mortgage-bond-scandal/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 blogpost }}}\uc2 , is that the banks could demand a discount from the loan originator whenever they found bad loans, pocketing it as a profit instead of passing it on to investors, who were kept in the dark.\par \par \uc2 And as the world discovered, investors being kept in the dark \u8212\'20\'14 whether through malice, greed or stupidity \u8212\'20\'14 did not end well.\par \par \uc2 Today, banks and any other securitisers in the US have to file a Form ABS-15G, which tells investors if there was an independent review of the underlying loans and, if so, what that review flagged up. The regulation requiring this disclosure came into force in June 2015.\par \par \uc2 But a securitiser can still choose not to have a third party inspect the loans, therefore avoiding having to disclose anything and saving money too.\par \par \uc2 This appears to be the typical state of affairs for most deals involving loans originated by online lenders.\par \par \uc2 Even where the reports are available, they show that digitisation is not quite the cure-all to the problem of bad borrower data that some have hoped.\par \par \uc2 Here\u8217\'20\'19s a list of all the online securitisations there have been up to the end of March this year, courtesy of PeerIQ, a data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company that tracks the online lending space. Click for the full thing:\par \par \uc2 The list has 47 deals worth $8.6bn, 23 of which were issued after the ABS-15G requirement came into force in June 2015, meaning that any third-party due diligence reports would have to be disclosed to the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  and made public.\par \par \uc2 So if there was third-party due diligence, theoretically anyone should be able to see it. But we were able to find just six reports for those 23 deals \u8212\'20\'14 if you find more, do let us know \u8212\'20\'14 suggesting that the vast majority were checked in-house by the issuer and therefore any problems found in the creation of the deal remain secret. (That count doesn\u8217\'20\'19t include deals issued since March.)\par \par \uc2 The deals that did have third-party due diligence tended to be those issued by the online lender themselves, rather than by an investor who had bought their loans.\par \par \uc2 For example, SoFi, which has always arranged its own deals, consistently has third-party due diligence. A spokesperson for Avant, whose securitisations this year were independently checked, said the oversight helps reassure investors given its relatively short track record as a securitiser. Similarly, a spokesperson for OnDeck, an online lender to small business, said both of the securitisations it has carried out directly were checked by independent auditors.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, none of Citi\u8217\'20\'19s securitisations of Prosper Marketplace loans appear to have had a third party checking over the loan data. A \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  report for the deal priced in March \u8212\'20\'14 the last before the relationship rather publicly fell apart \u8212\'20\'14 notes that Citi did \u8220\'20\'1Call the due diligence in-house\u8221\'20\'1D. Both Prosper and Citi declined to comment. (As did almost all of the online lenders we contacted.)\par \par \uc2 But where third-party checks did occur, they were only skin-deep. As PwC states in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555110/000089853116000625/slc-abs15g.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a February report }}}\uc2  for a securitisation by SoFi, the checks do not involve any assurances on \u8220\'20\'1Cthe completeness, accuracy, appropriateness, quality or integrity of any of the information\u8221\'20\'1D in the loan documents.\par \par \uc2 All the checks consist of is comparing a spreadsheet full of loan information with the underlying documentation, both of which are ultimately provided by the company that made the loan in the first place. There are no efforts to independently check if the information is accurate.\par \par \uc2 That said, even this rather shallow task throws up interesting discoveries that should make you question the data systems of even the newest fintech companies.\par \par \uc2 For example, this is from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555110/000089706916000889/cg753a.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a May PwC report }}}\uc2  on another SoFi deal, showing the discrepancies in gross income that appeared between the spreadsheet, the \u8220\'20\'1Cdata file value\u8221\'20\'1D, and the income calculated from the underlying documentation, or \u8220\'20\'1Csource file value\u8221\'20\'1D:\par \par \uc2 For context, that\u8217\'20\'19s three from a sample of 600 loans.\par \par \uc2 There are a few more noted in this report on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555110/000089853116000625/slc-abs15g.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 aforementioned February report }}}\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 from a smaller sample of 100 loans \u8212\'20\'14 including a three-year discrepancy in the graduation date of one borrower (the third from the bottom):\par \par \uc2 Or perhaps more comically, in this {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1658153/000089706916000580/cg641.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 December EY report }}}\uc2  on a deal by Earnest, another online lender to students, the discrepancies in a sample of 150 loans include the transformation of a $150,000 a year salary from \uc2 Blackstone Group\uc2  into a $450,000 a year salary from \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  (if only life were so easy):\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1658153/000089706916000832/cg731.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 An April report }}}\uc2  by Deloitte for another Earnest deal shows similar mixups in another sample of 150 loans (click to enlarge):\par \par \uc2 The point here is not that these deals were bad, or that these lenders have less reliable data than anyone else. Rather it\u8217\'20\'19s a reminder that even finance companies who have very recently built their systems from scratch don\u8217\'20\'19t get it right all of the time.\par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19ve seen the same thing in the UK. In the process of investigating Ratesetter\u8217\'20\'19s loan book and querying certain entries with the company, we found at times that the data were incorrect and could not be taken at face value.\par \par \uc2 Interestingly, there is also a report for the Jefferies securitisation of \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  loans, which would have been the first rated deal involving the company\u8217\'20\'19s loans but instead resulted in the departure of chief executive and founder \uc2 Renaud Laplanche\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In case it\u8217\'20\'19s not fresh in your memory, the seeds of the crisis were a borrower documentation change requested by Jefferies. \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  duly made the change, but an employee tweaked the date on a batch of loans to make it look like they had been originated after the change had been agreed \u8212\'20\'14 thereby making it seem like they qualified for the deal.\par \par \uc2 The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650171/000092963816001434/exhibit99-1.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 report by Deloitte }}}\uc2 , published on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650171/000092963816001434/0000929638-16-001434-index.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 May 4th }}}\uc2 , five full days before \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  revealed the scandal and its share price cratered, hints at those events. In the report, Deloitte says it received a listing of loans on April 5th, from which it randomly chose a sample. Then, a few weeks later on April 26th, Deloitte received a data file, likely a spreadsheet, which it would compare with the sample.\par \par \uc2 But on April 27, the following day, Deloitte received another data file, which contained \u8220\'20\'1Can updated origination date for each of the 11,830 unsecured consumer loans\u8221\'20\'1D in the initial data file:\par \par \uc2 We were instructed by representatives of the Company [Jefferies] to replace the origination date information set forth on the Initial Data File with the corresponding information set forth on the Origination Date Supplemental Data File\par \par \uc2 The report goes on to say that Deloitte found about half of the loans it sampled were missing from the data file. \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  and Jefferies declined to comment. Deloitte did not return a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 As it happened, \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  came clean and made a pretty good show to investors that it wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t tolerate any messing around with its loan data \u8212\'20\'14 even if there seems to be have been more going on than meets the eye.\par \par \uc2 But relying on finance companies to fess up instead of burying misdeeds has historically been a pretty bad bet, which is why these sorts of third-party reviews are important, even for fintech startups.\par \par \uc2 Related Links:\par \par \uc2 Who knew what at \uc2 Lending Club\uc2 ? \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 Some \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  news you might have missed because you were watching its shares crash and burn \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 The legal tweak that led to disaster for \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 There are bigger questions for \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  to answer \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 Why \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  has shunned securitisations \u8211\'20\'13 FT Alphaville\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/02/bubbles-and-fraud"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A smoking gun? }}}\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 Economist\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160609ec690053d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 American GIs who came to the UK for D-Day 72 years ago were jokingly said to be \u8220\'20\'1Coverpaid, oversexed and over here\u8221\'20\'1D. US investment banks have achieved their own victory in Europe in recent years, occupying four out of the top five spots for fees earned, according to \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group Coalition.\par \par \uc2 Whether bankers at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , and \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2  are oversexed is for other pundits to judge. But it is questionable whether the banks themselves are overpaid. European clients shell out fees that are 18 per cent lower than those in the US.\par \par \uc2 European investment bankers, lacking a credible international champion of their own, tend to regard the disparity as unfair. They argue it is easy for Americans to muscle into their market, brought up to fighting weight by domestic fees as high as 7 per cent for a flotation.\par \par \uc2 But charges may be high because US customers are insensitive to price, rather than because there is a cartel. The greater wonder is that European companies are so value-conscious over deals that may matter critically. One theory is that a slew of loss-leading privatisation mandates set European fees artificially low in the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 High US fees might equally be a cultural quirk. Some Americans wear turtleneck sweaters under their shirts and think Seth Rogen is funny.\par \par \uc2 Either way, the horrid truth Europeans should recognise is that US investment banks are successful here because they deserve to be. Their advice is no worse than local rivals, their distribution will often be better and they have big economies of scale.\par \par \uc2 Their commitment to staying in the business wins them clients and talented staff. Brands such as \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2  were well known in the City at the time of Big Bang three decades ago. British investment banking names like Barings, Kleinwort Benson and SG Warburg were big back then but are now largely historic footnotes.\par \par \uc2 US customers and stockholders should regard the implicit subsidy they provide to the European clients of Wall Street banks as a form of the Marshall Aid, which, after D-Day, helped rebuild a ravaged continent. The locals weren\u8217\'20\'19t notably grateful for that, either.\par \par \uc2 Kicker conspiracy\par \par \uc2 The imminent Euro 2016 football tournament will give fans the chance to debate the salient differences between the English and German version of the games. The playbook for awarding TV rights for football in both countries is identical: players extract astronomic pay from their clubs, which pass on the cost to broadcaster \uc2 Sky\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The long-suffering \uc2 News Corp\uc2  affiliate has just agreed to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/06/09/sky-climbs-after-scoring-german-football-contract/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pay  }}}\uc2 an average of 80 per cent more to show Bundesliga matches for four seasons at a cost of around \u8364\'20\'AC3.5bn. It has lost exclusivity over top-flight German football in the process.\par \par \uc2 The outcome was as familiar as Germany defeating England in a semi-final. \uc2 Sky\uc2  last year agreed to pay 70 per cent more for three seasons of Premiership rights. Back then BT, rather than John Malone\u8217\'20\'19s Eurosport, was the deep-pocketed interloper who pushed up the bidding.\par \par \uc2 The gamble chief executive \uc2 Jeremy Darroch\uc2  took with Premiership rights appears justified by strong earnings and a declining debt burden. At best he can be credited with buying time for \uc2 Sky\uc2 , a medium-sized business whose fortunes are inextricably linked to a big money game. Mr Darroch himself is likely to have moved on before costs become truly unsustainable.\par \par \uc2 Kiwi combo\par \par \uc2 Flight of the Conchords, a sitcom about Kiwis adrift among New Yorkers ignorant of their nation, spawned the wry slogan: \u8220\'20\'1CNew Zealand: it\u8217\'20\'19s not part of Australia\u8221\'20\'1D. Nor is New Zealand\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Sky Network Television\uc2  part of the UK\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Sky\uc2 , mentioned above. But the group is set to become a subsidiary of deal-hungry telecoms group \uc2 Vodafone\uc2  through a NZ$3.4bn merger, which, for readability, we\u8217\'20\'19ll convert to US$2.4bn.\par \par \uc2 British companies have been hanging back from M&A ahead of the Brexit vote. \uc2 Vodafone\uc2  is going ahead with this deal, though in a place about as far as you can get from Nigel Farage without boarding a spaceship.\par \par \uc2 Telephone air time is increasingly commodified. There is fierce competition in pay TV. The combination of SNT and Voda\u8217\'20\'19s New Zealand operations is expected to yield cost and capital expenditure synergies with a net present value of $295m.\par \par \uc2 The partners are promoting the deal as a merger, though it can also be seen as a reverse takeover by \uc2 Vodafone\uc2 . The UK group will own 51 per cent of a group that will retain SNT\u8217\'20\'19s New Zealand listing. SNT, which is smaller than \uc2 Vodafone New Zealand\uc2 , is paying the parent $850m in debt-financed cash and the balance of the $2.4bn consideration in its own shares. These will be issued at a premium to the undisturbed market price, implying Voda is contributing its Kiwi cash flows to the combined group at a discount.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jonathan.guthrie@ft.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jonathan.guthrie@ft.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020160609ec69006v9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

He said the group had seen bookings increase more than 1,000 per cent in the past year, and was cash-flow-positive.\par \par \uc2 Cylance uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to detect threats to computers and other devices, rather than simply comparing viruses with lists of known malicious software.\par \par \uc2 Existing investors, including Silicon Valley venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and DFJ Growth, as well as private equity firm \uc2 KKR\uc2 , participated in the round.\par \par \uc2 Cylance's fundraising came after a period when venture capitalists appeared to be holding back from backing cyber security companies. The pause came after VCs spent two to three years pouring cash into start-ups in the sector in the hope that they could solve customers' cyber security problems and earn them millions.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lot of noise in this space," said Mr McClure. "Deal flow may be starting to come back for now, but it is sort of a tentative and waiting game."\par \par \uc2 Cylance is not alone in breaking the freeze: Lookout, a start-up focused on protecting smartphones, received an investment from \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  for an undisclosed sum recently.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020160609ec690002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Using a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  system, it identifies genetic characteristics to distinguish between people who have cancer and those who don't.\par \par \uc2 The technology detects known so-called cancer signatures and uncovers new ones, according to Chief Executive Gabriel Otte. In early research the technology has correctly distinguished between normal and cancerous blood samples. Having validated the approach in hundreds of samples, Freenome now plans testing in thousands of cases, Mr. Otte said. The company plans to publish papers describing how and why its tests work, according to Mr. Otte.\par \par \uc2 Freenome decided to raise a small amount while vetting its system. It will seek a larger funding depending on how studies progress, Mr. Otte said.\par \par \uc2 Developing a test is only the first step to success for liquid-biopsy companies. Winning support from regulators and insurers is also vital. Freenome says it is working with Medicare and the \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  on premarket review.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Thousands of startups are born in Silicon Valley each year, but sometimes the freshest perspectives on new technology come from outsiders.\par \par \uc2 That is what happened with Tradeshift Holdings Inc., a six-year-old startup that was born in Denmark in 2010, although the company moved its headquarters to San Francisco a year later.\par \par \uc2 Tradeshift's three founders\u8212\'20\'14Christian Lanng, Mikkel Hippe Brun and Gert Sylvest\u8212\'20\'14met while working on a Danish government project, a software platform to digitize invoices, which was ultimately adopted by 95% of Denmark's businesses.\par \par \uc2 That gave them the idea for Tradeshift, which has raised $205 million and is on track this year to generate $50 million in revenue, according to Mr. Lanng, who is the company's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2010/12/16/tradeshift-aims-to-disrupt-business-banking/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 TradeShift Aims To Disrupt Business Banking}}}\uc2  (Dec. 16, 2010)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020130125e91pmbsit"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Big Shift for Tradeshift in $10M Intuit Deal}}}\uc2  (Jan. 25, 2013)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150811eb8bnw6fh"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tradeshift Acquires Merchantry for $30M}}}\uc2  (Aug. 11, 2015)\par \par \uc2 The company's latest funding, a $75 million Series D round, values Tradeshift at more than $500 million.\par \par \uc2 Tradeshift started after its founders noticed that when companies traded goods or services, especially between countries, their business was often analog and involved sending invoices over email or fax.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur core idea was we have \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 , but when it comes to companies, why don't we connect them in the cloud, in a network that feels more like \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  or \uc2 Facebook\uc2 ?" Mr. Lanng said.\par \par \uc2 At first, Tradeshift was just a free social network for businesses, although one that included the ability for members to do business with each other and build apps. The network spread to more than 100 countries.\par \par \uc2 About 18 months ago, Tradeshift also started selling software that companies could use to connect and manage their supply chains.\par \par \uc2 Companies can still do business on the network for free, but if they buy Tradeshift's software they get tools to manage complicated issues such as tax compliance and can also create private marketplaces for their suppliers.\par \par \uc2 Tradeshift now finds itself competing with \uc2 Oracle Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 SAP SE\uc2  for deals, Mr. Lanng said. More than 800,000 companies use the platform, and Tradeshift has several partnerships, including one with Baiwang, which provides tax-related services in China.\par \par \uc2 One reason Tradeshift has grown is because of the way the company applies \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and large-scale computing to \u8220\'20\'1Cingesting, validating, checking for fraud, extracting the signal from and intelligently routing an insane number of invoices," said Data Collective co-founder Matt Ocko, who joins Tradeshift's board.\par \par \uc2 When the Danish government asked Tradeshift's founders to digitize invoices for the nation's businesses, Mr. Ocko said, \u8220\'20\'1Cthey didn't know that level of automation had never been attempted."\par \par \uc2 Tradeshift's new funding round includes investments from several banks, because \u8220\'20\'1Cbanks are increasingly not able to access the next generation of business data," Mr. Lanng said.\par \par \uc2 To be competitive, modern companies need agility, he said, and for that they need software, which is \u8220\'20\'1Canachronistic and expensive and they have a hard time doing that."\par \par \uc2 Tradeshift's new funding was led by Data Collective, which was an early investor in the company, and includes several new investors: \uc2 HSBC Bank PLC\uc2 ; American Express Ventures; CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund, which is managed by CreditEase; and Pavilion Capital. Current investor Notion Capital also participated in the round.\par \par \uc2 Write to Deborah Gage at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Deborah.Gage@dowjones.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Deborah.Gage@dowjones.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020160609ec69001xi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 For a long time, for many tech companies, the idea of getting a listing, especially on \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 , was one of their highest goals. In the past few years, though, more companies are choosing to stay private or delay their listings.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  is implementing a big change in the form of blockchain -- a system that underpins the digital currency bitcoin and allows companies to make and verify transactions on a network instantaneously without a central authority.\par \par \uc2 For a look at what these changes might mean, The Wall Street Journal's \uc2 Gerard Baker\uc2  spoke with the chief executive officer of Nasdaq, Bob Greifeld. Here are edited excerpts of their conversation.\par \par \uc2 MR. BAKER: The phenomenon we've seen in this tech boom is the unicorn -- companies that don't go public, don't list. Or at least they delay their listings. Some of them are already enormous companies. They are weighing out very carefully the pros and cons of a listing, the onerous reporting requirements, against the demand for liquidity. How do you see it?\par \par \uc2 MR. GREIFELD: We typically counsel companies to think long and hard about going public. When you go public, you're obviously taking in money from shareholders who don't know you. Your reporting requirement as a result of that is quite onerous. And because they don't know you, they have to buy into a fundamental investment thesis. And that investment thesis better match your business model, and that communication has to be clear.\par \par \uc2 Now that business model does not have to say I'm going to make X% growth quarter after quarter in profits. It could be a model that talks about a story, but then you have to deliver on that story.\par \par \uc2 As I like to say, as a CEO of a public company, I get my report card every three months, right? We have to report every three months. And if you're not ready for that scrutiny, then you should wait until you are in fact ready to go there. So in terms of the companies that have gone public, that have been successful, the investment thesis matches the operation of the business.\par \par \uc2 MR. BAKER: Let's talk about China. \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  was a favored destination for a lot of Chinese companies. Companies have pulled out, partly because of some reporting issues and partly because of some scandals there.\par \par \uc2 What's going on? Are investors more wary of some of these Chinese companies? Are the Chinese companies themselves more nervous?\par \par \uc2 MR. GREIFELD: We had a rush of Chinese companies that came to market, that did not fully understand the reporting regime and the scrutiny they would be under. So we had a period of delisting of those companies. [Now] our pipeline for Chinese companies coming to the U.S. is as strong as it's been in half a decade. A decade ago, it was really very ebullient in terms of companies rushing to come to the U.S. It's not that, but I think it's at a healthy level.\par \par \uc2 We think we'll come out with something approaching 10 Chinese companies listing in the U.S. in 2016. That's, I think, a healthy number. And in the context of the fact that the overall U.S. IPO market has been depressed, as a percent it's quite healthy.\par \par \uc2 MR. BAKER: There had been some issues with a number of very prominent companies, most recently Alibaba, announcing that it was subject to an SEC investigation of some of its accounting practices. Is this raising broader concerns about the reliability of reporting in China?\par \par \uc2 MR. GREIFELD: I don't know any details on Alibaba, but I think it's also a little bit unfair to say, wow, a Chinese company has a reporting issue, because we would have a very, very long list of American companies that have had reporting issues.\par \par \uc2 MR. BAKER: But there were a succession of Chinese companies.\par \par \uc2 MR. GREIFELD: We went through that phase five or six years ago. I think we're at a healthy balance today. We have many companies that have to learn as they go along and get better at reporting.\par \par \uc2 MR. BAKER: Let's move on to some broader technology questions. Tell us how you are changing. You've talked a lot very excitedly about blockchain and the changes that it's making to the way you can work. Tell us a bit about how that's affecting \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 MR. GREIFELD: With respect to \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 , I've always felt that we are a technology company. If you take away the imprimatur, or the exchange license, we're a transaction-processing business. In buzzy terms, we run our business in the cloud. It's software as a service, we get paid per use.\par \par \uc2 We're on the cusp of a golden age of technology, and it feels exciting. Blockchain and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  are really going to change the world that we live in. [With blockchain] you can obviate the need for the trusted intermediaries. And when you start thinking in those terms, it's amazing how many trusted intermediaries there are. That whole middle layer that exists and represents friction in the system will go away.\par \par \uc2 The first real thing we did with blockchain was in \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  Private Market. In December, we did a trade, a liquidity event, where we traded, settled, cleared and moved the money in 10 minutes. That sounds interesting. It sounds great when you see if you bought or sold Apple that day, it would take three days.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the limitations of blockchain today, it can handle about 10 transactions per second. In the trading in our market today, we handle millions of transactions a second. So it's apples and oranges. I think where blockchain will come in on the transaction side is when the volume of trading and activity is less active and there's more dimensions to the order.\par \par \uc2 So, an equity trade is the easiest thing in the world because you've got to buy a thousand shares of Apple at a price. As you get into over-the-counter instruments, derivative instruments, you have a whole series of dimensions to it. And that would be more appropriate for blockchain.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20160608000013"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this
