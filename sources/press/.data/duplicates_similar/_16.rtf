We are excited about the potential they offer."\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year BlackRock hired Bill MacCartney, a former \uc2 Google\uc2  scientist, to help it apply \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to quantitative investment strategies.\par \par \uc2 Mr MacCartney works with the US fund house's global equities research team from its base in Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 Mr Sarrau says: "[The Silicon Valley hub is focused on] building tools to help us gather information from \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Several asset managers, including Amundi, BNY Mellon, \uc2 State Street\uc2  and NN Partners, have expressed an interest in analysing large volumes of data.\par \par \uc2 In a paper published in May 2015, BNY Mellon said \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  could be used to identify "correlations and patterns" that "cannot be observed manually or even with traditional analytical techniques that require significant human guidance".\par \par \uc2 "There is a requirement for machines and data to link together initially," the paper adds.\par \par \uc2 Asset management houses are already making use of the increased amount of data available to them through social media sites.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock said last week that it is using data gathered from both \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the microblogging site, to help it formulate investment decisions. NN Investment Partners says it is also doing this.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at a fund market conference earlier this year, asset management executives warned that those who did not "get on board the \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  train" would be "left behind".\par \par \uc2 Alongside investment processes, sales and operations were named as areas where data could help fund houses improve their business.\par \par \uc2 Although fund managers recognise that \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  could provide valuable insights, many remain uncertain about how to apply vast data sets from sources as disparate as \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 , the coffee chain, to their investment processes.\par \par \uc2 Nick Thomas, a partner at Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based fund house, told FTfm: "We are absolutely fascinated by the power of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and how it makes \uc2 Google\uc2  a fantastic business, and we are some of the biggest holders of [companies] such as Amazon [the ecommerce group] and Baidu [the Chinese search company], who are at the cutting edge of using data to build amazing internet businesses.\par \par \uc2 "But trying to fit some of those ideas into our investment process is difficult because we take a very long-term, slow approach to investing."\par \par \uc2 This article first appeared in Ignites Europe, an FT news service\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020151019ebaj0000d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

We are excited about the potential they offer.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year BlackRock hired Bill MacCartney, a former Google scientist, to help it apply \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to quantitative investment strategies.\par \par \uc2 Mr MacCartney works with the US fund house\u8217\'20\'19s global equities research team from its base in Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 Mr Sarrau says: \u8220\'20\'1C[The Silicon Valley hub is focused on] building tools to help us gather information from \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Several asset managers, including Amundi, BNY Mellon, \uc2 State Street\uc2  and NN Partners, have expressed an interest in analysing large volumes of data.\par \par \uc2 In a paper published in May 2015, BNY Mellon said \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  could be used to identify \u8220\'20\'1Ccorrelations and patterns\u8221\'20\'1D that \u8220\'20\'1Ccannot be observed manually or even with traditional analytical techniques that require significant human guidance\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a requirement for machines and data to link together initially,\u8221\'20\'1D the paper adds.\par \par \uc2 Asset management houses are already making use of the increased amount of data available to them through social media sites.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock said last week that it is using data gathered from both \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the microblogging site, to help it formulate investment decisions. NN Investment Partners says it is also doing this.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at a fund market conference earlier this year, asset management executives warned that those who did not \u8220\'20\'1Cget on board the \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  train\u8221\'20\'1D would be \u8220\'20\'1Cleft behind\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Alongside investment processes, sales and operations were named as areas where data could help fund houses improve their business.\par \par \uc2 Although fund managers recognise that \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  could provide valuable insights, many remain uncertain about how to apply vast data sets from sources as disparate as \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 , the coffee chain, to their investment processes.\par \par \uc2 Nick Thomas, a partner at Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based fund house, told FTfm: \u8220\'20\'1CWe are absolutely fascinated by the power of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and how it makes \uc2 Google\uc2  a fantastic business, and we are some of the biggest holders of [companies] such as Amazon [the ecommerce group] and Baidu [the Chinese search company], who are at the cutting edge of using data to build amazing internet businesses.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut trying to fit some of those ideas into our investment process is difficult because we take a very long-term, slow approach to investing.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This article first appeared in Ignites Europe, an FT news service\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020151018ebai0008i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Over three months, it is down 5.8 per cent, according to figures from FE \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \u163\'00\'A3634m Axa Framlington Biotech fund, an open-ended product held by many self-directed investors, meanwhile shed 12.2 per cent over the past month and 16.8 per cent over three months.\par \par \uc2 That followed years of steady rises, however. The \uc2 Axa\uc2  fund was up 280 per cent in the four years to July, meaning investors who entered the fund early will still have made substantial gains.\par \par \uc2 The biotech sell-off was sparked by comments from the US Democratic presidential hopeful \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , who said she would look to reform drug pricing if she is elected president in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Commentators including \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  , chair of the US Federal Reserve , had previously warned of stretched valuations in the fast-growing biotechnology sector, which looks to exploit biological processes to make drugs and other products.\par \par \uc2 Mr Woodford's head of investment communications, Mitchell Fraser-Jones, said in a trust update: "The portfolio's US stocks were among the weakest performers, as sentiment towards US biotech remained sour.\par \par \uc2 "Given the way that the sector has traded this year, with very strong performance in the first half, the sell-off is perhaps unsurprising.\par \par \uc2 "We have, however, been disappointed that stocks such as Prothena and \uc2 Northwest Biotherapeutics\uc2  have become so embroiled in it - the valuation attached to their shares is very far from the bubble-like levels that some . . . peers have reached."\par \par \uc2 The company has seen nothing to change the fundamental investment case for these stocks, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Although September was a disappointing month in performance terms, we retain absolute conviction in the long-term outlook for the trust," Mr Fraser-Jones added.\par \par \uc2 Patient Capital, which mainly invests in early-stage and early-growth companies - not exclusively in the biotech sector - is designed for investors who intend to commit money for at least five years.\par \par \uc2 It has shed 2.2 per cent of net asset value since its launch in April , but is still trading at an 8.8 per cent premium because of investors' faith in Mr Woodford's extended record.\par \par \uc2 Linden Thomson, manager of the Axa biotech fund , said her fund does not hold Valeant or \uc2 Turing Pharmaceuticals\uc2  , two of the companies most associated with drug price inflation, since she does not classify them as biotechnology companies.\par \par \uc2 Like Mr Woodford, she has made no significant changes to her portfolio - whose largest holdings are \uc2 Celgene Corp\uc2  and \uc2 Gilead Sciences\uc2  - as a result of recent market swings.\par \par \uc2 "We believe that fundamentals remain solid for this sector and maintain our forecast of 20 per cent growth over the next two years," said Ms Thomson. "In an environment concerned about growth, the biotech sector is one area which looks likely to continue to grow strongly through various market cycles."\par \par \uc2 Demographic trends and demand from countries outside the US and western Europe will continue to support the industry, she added, although it does face question marks over the sustainability of high drug prices, and must negotiate competition from generic drugs.\par \par \uc2 Rival healthcare funds have also taken a hit: \uc2 Polar Capital\uc2 's biotechnology fund shed 13.4 per cent over the three months to the end of September, while funds run by Candriam Investors Group and \uc2 Pictet Asset Management\uc2  were down 14.7 and 13.4 per cent respectively.\par \par \uc2 Among trusts, Frostrow's Biotech Growth Trust is down 23.5 per cent over three months, and the Worldwide Healthcare Trust, run by the same company, has shed 13.3 per cent of its value.\par \par \uc2 Polar Capital Global Healthcare Growth and Income declined 8.78 per cent over three months, while rival SV Life Sciences International Biotechnology Trust shed 16.4 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Beckwith, director of manager research at Morningstar, said that biotech shares' fall was "a necessary correction after a phenomenal bull run". "It's had such a strong run and made some much money that the first time there was some bad news, people were bound to take some profits," he said.\par \par \uc2 "This is a high-risk, high-return sector. They [investors] need to understand how much they can afford to lose and whether they want to take on this sort of risk."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFTA00020151017ebah0002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - LIFE & ARTS\par {\*\bkmkstart toc3}{\*\bkmkend toc3}\b \uc2 FT Diary\b0\par\par\uc2 By Izabella Kaminska   \par \uc2 866 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 October 2015\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 02\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 It's October in New York and the sun is blazing. I packed all the wrong clothes. But who can complain? There's nothing like autumn among the sun-soaked skyscrapers of Manhattan, with the pumpkins, the Halloween decorations and the leaves turning from green to orange to red.\par \par \uc2 I've arrived just in time for the finance-themed, intellectual marathon of the year: the FT pub quiz, organised by the New York division of FT Alphaville. They've set the questions, found the venue, invited the guests and, most importantly, bagged former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and the Financal Times' US managing editor Gillian Tett as quiz masters.\par \par \uc2 With hosts of that calibre, not to mention a prize list that includes drones and signed editions of Volcker's own 2012 "rule" restricting banks' ability to speculate (the toughest regulation to hit Wall Street since Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002), is it any wonder the event is so oversubscribed that we've had to hire a bouncer?\par \par \uc2 Paul Volcker arrives with Gillian Tett and is immediately escorted to the liquidity distribution zone - or bar. As we are introduced, I'm struck not just by how tall he is - 6ft 7in - but also by his charm and humour. At which point Tett remarks that chairman Volcker, who contributed questions of his own for the quiz, has stumbled across errors in the other sections. So much for \uc2 Google\uc2 , eh? A more stringent internet search quickly confirms - unsurprisingly - that he is right. We've made a factual error regarding the unemployment rate and inflation. Frantic question-restructuring follows.\par \par \uc2 "So, when will the Fed be raising rates?" a colleague asks him, cheekily.\par \par \uc2 "Not before 2056!" quips Volcker.\par \par \uc2 He's keener to talk about how the quiz will be a bridging of knowledge gaps. There's his knowledge of finance and our technological insight on social media and modern telecoms devices. Volcker calls this a fair exchange, though I suspect he is overegging his ignorance. When I mention bitcoin, he defines the mechanics that underpin the system in two short sentences. After the quiz starts, it soon becomes clear Volcker is probably as big an icon in financial circles as Kim Kardashian is on Instagram. Neither is he a social media newbie. On the sidelines, a queue begins to form for Volcker selfies.\par \par \uc2 While I'm in town I've arranged to meet financial crime author and writer Jeffrey Robinson for lunch at what he claims is a proper New York institution: Katz's Delicatessen on East Houston Street, best known as the setting for that cinematic moment when Sally met Harry to give him some much-needed advice on women. We chat about Robinson's new projects, his time cruising with the City of London police and celery-tonic soda, while chomping on pastrami sandwiches stacked 15cm high. Then Robinson insists on taking me to the Strand Bookstore on Broadway and its rare editions and crime aisles, where I clock his book and insist he signs it. Before we part, we exchange gifts - for me, a mug; for him, a book by Thomas Levenson called Newton and the Counterfeiter , about when the man who discovered gravity was offered a job as warden of the Royal Mint.\par \par \uc2 My day meeting authors with a penchant for shadowy areas of finance isn't over. I've arranged to meet the quant of all quants, \uc2 Emanuel Derman\uc2 , author of My Life as a Quant and Models Behaving Badly , for dinner in an Indian restaurant by Columbus Circle.\par \par \uc2 I can't wait to get his perspective on \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , volatility and feedback loops and Derman doesn't disappoint. His is a unique mind but one grounded in reality - what you'd expect from a former physicist. The conversation turns to Chappie , the 2015 AI film based in Johannesburg, which I recommend he - as a South African quant - should watch, especially after I discover he's a fan of Die Antwoord, the rap-rave duo who feature in the movie.\par \par \uc2 New York Comic Con sold outmonthsago but I am lucky to have wangled a press invite from Felix Salmon, editor at the multimedia network Fusion, to his panel on "The Amazing Economics of Star Trek ", featuring economists Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong. The panel also features Manu Saadia, author of the new book Trekonomics .\par \par \uc2 We quickly learn that the post-scarcity environment of Star Trek - where anything can be produced with replicators, and money doesn't exist - is probably not a utopian state. In fact, the panellists emphasise that the highly meritocratic society is likely to be highly unequal. For example, we, the viewers, only see the adventures of the top 1 per cent of the top 1 per cent of the top 1 per cent.\par \par \uc2 I ask the panellists whether the Fed will have raised rates by the 24th century? No one dares to answer - presumably because there is no money by then, and thus no interest rates?\par \par \uc2 At least I'm left with a workable forecast. Somewhere between 2056 and star date 2364 seems likely.\par \par \uc2 Izabella Kaminska is a reporter for FT Alphaville\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020151017ebah0004t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Mr Staley will be stepping into the shoes of former chief executive and retail banker \uc2 Antony Jenkins\uc2  who was sacked less than three months after \uc2 John MacFarlane\uc2  took over as chairman. Mr MacFarlane is expected to maintain a hands-on style of management even after relinquishing his interim executive role and going back to being chairman.\par \par \uc2 Before joining US hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital in 2013, Mr Staley spent 30 years at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , and rose to be head of its investment bank. His expected appointment raises questions about the bank's direction, and whether it will steer more towards the investment banking side than its retail operations. Outwardly, this need not be a cause for alarm; the investment bank boosted pre-tax profit by more than a third to \u163\'00\'A31.4bn in the first half of this year, but it was this side that suffered the worst as a result of the economic crash.\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2  is in the process of a significant restructuring of its operations, having shed over 10 per cent of its workforce and a quarter of the assets on its balance sheet. UK banks are also having to go through a protracted scheme whereby retail banking is ringfenced from investment banking activities to protect taxpayers from having to bail out a bank again. \uc2 Barclays\uc2  faces a tough challenge because of the size of its investment bank arm which grew with the acquisition of the US operation formerly run by \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2 . Jonas Crosland\par \par \uc2 BUY\par \par \uc2 Media\par \par \uc2 Next Fifteen Comms (NFC)\par \par \uc2 Next Fifteen shares have risen 7 per cent since July. They trade on 13 times forecast earnings, which looks cheap\par \par \uc2 Few marketing and media relations agencies count \uc2 Google\uc2 , Amazon and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  among their clients; \uc2 Next Fifteen Communications\uc2  added \uc2 Intel\uc2  and \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  to its impressive roster in the six months to the end of July, as brisk demand for its data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , software and digital communications services fuelled a 31 per cent rise in operating profit to \u163\'00\'A37.2m.\par \par \uc2 Next Fifteen has been quick to embrace new ways of getting clients' messages across, including analysing data to hone campaigns and using new channels such as social media.\par \par \uc2 These efforts underpinned organic sales growth of a tenth in the US as Outcast, Beyond and other agencies won work.\par \par \uc2 The group also shelled out \u163\'00\'A32.4m to acquire three UK agencies and continued to streamline its non-US overseas operations.\par \par \uc2 This process, which has involved pruning the client base, cut constant-currency revenue by 9 per cent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, but helped more than double the operating margin in Asia Pacific to 13.2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The company's management remains dedicated to digital innovation. Its Agent3 unit recently built a software platform that provides insights into customers for the sales and marketing departments of large companies. Next Fifteen plans to boost investment in product development and sales support here.\par \par \uc2 Broker Investec Securities expects pre-tax profit of \u163\'00\'A315.6m for the year to January 2016, giving earnings per share of 15.3p. Theron Mohamed\par \par \uc2 HOLD\par \par \uc2 General retailers\par \par \uc2 N Brown\uc2  (BWNG)\par \par \uc2 Broker \uc2 Peel Hunt\uc2  thinks it could be "a stretch" for the retailer to meet current forecasts\par \par \uc2 Shares in retailer \uc2 N Brown\uc2  trade on a fairly undemanding forward price/earnings ratio of 14, and the dividend yield is generous, but investors have been burnt before on this one.\par \par \uc2 The share price rose by 7 per cent after the group reported first-half results that were better than expected. However, expectations were low as a result of extensive restructuring under way at the company and last year's profit warning. Even on an adjusted basis, pre-tax profits for the half-year to August 29 fell 16 per cent to \u163\'00\'A335m.\par \par \uc2 Chief executive \uc2 Angela Spindler\uc2  told investors to expect a stronger finish to the current financial year. That's because exceptional costs associated with the revamp - which involved 380 redundancies and the closure of 18 clearance stores in the first half, costing nearly \u163\'00\'A315m - should fall to between \u163\'00\'A32m and \u163\'00\'A33m in the second half.\par \par \uc2 As the operational transformation from a catalogue-led business to a digital retailer continues, \uc2 N Brown\uc2  is also changing the way it reports its financial results. For the first time, the group split its revenues into "product" and "financial services". The former grew 6.1 per cent during the first six months as digital sales took off, while the latter - which tracks the money \uc2 N Brown\uc2  makes on the credit it offers customers - dipped 0.4 per cent. Overall, like-for-like sales grew 3.1 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Peel Hunt\uc2  expects pre-tax profits of \u163\'00\'A386.6m for the current financial year, giving earnings per share of 24.6p, compared with \u163\'00\'A386.2m and 21p for the year ended February 2015.

Mr Staley will be stepping into the shoes of former chief executive and retail banker \uc2 Antony Jenkins\uc2  who was sacked less than three months after \uc2 John MacFarlane\uc2  took over as chairman. Mr MacFarlane is expected to maintain a hands-on style of management even after relinquishing his interim executive role and going back to being chairman.\par \par \uc2 Before joining US hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital in 2013, Mr Staley spent 30 years at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , and rose to be head of its investment bank. His expected appointment raises questions about the bank\u8217\'20\'19s strategic direction, and whether the emphasis will steer more towards the investment banking side rather than its retail operations. Outwardly, this need not be a cause for alarm; the investment bank boosted pre-tax profit by more than a third to \u163\'00\'A31.4bn in the first half of this year, but it was the investment banking side that suffered the worst as a result of the economic crash.\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2  is in the process of a significant restructuring of its operations, having shed over 10 per cent of its workforce and a quarter of the assets on its balance sheet. UK banks are also having to go through a protracted scheme whereby retail banking is ringfenced from investment banking activities to protect taxpayers from ever having to foot the bill of bailing out a bank again. \uc2 Barclays\uc2  faces a particularly tough challenge because of the size of its investment banking arm which grew with the acquisition of the US operation formerly run by \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Buy: Next Fifteen (NFC)\par \par \uc2 Next Fifteen\u8217\'20\'19s shares have risen 7 per cent since July. They trade on 13 times forecast earnings, which looks cheap given the group\u8217\'20\'19s blue-chip clients, writes Theron Mohamed.\par \par \uc2 Few marketing and media relations agencies count \uc2 Google\uc2 , Amazon and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  among their clients; \uc2 Next Fifteen Communications\uc2  added \uc2 Intel\uc2  and \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  to its impressive roster in the six months to end-July, as brisk demand for its data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , software and digital communications services fuelled a 31 per cent rise in operating profit to \u163\'00\'A37.2m.\par \par \uc2 Next Fifteen has been quick to embrace new ways of getting clients\u8217\'20\'19 messages across, including analysing data to hone campaigns and using new channels such as social media. These efforts underpinned organic sales growth of a tenth in the US as Outcast, Beyond and other agencies won work.\par \par \uc2 The group also shelled out \u163\'00\'A32.4m to acquire three UK agencies and continued to streamline its non-US overseas operations. This process, which has involved pruning the client base, cut constant-currency revenue by 9 per cent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, but helped more than double the operating margin in Asia Pacific to 13.2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Management remains dedicated to digital innovation. Its Agent3 unit recently built a software platform that provides insights into customers for the sales and marketing departments of large companies. Next Fifteen plans to boost investment in product development and sales support here.\par \par \uc2 Broker Investec Securities expects pre-tax profit of \u163\'00\'A315.6m for the year to January 2016, giving earnings per share of 15.3p.\par \par \uc2 Hold: \uc2 N Brown\uc2  (BWNG)\par \par \uc2 Management is bullish on the second half, but \uc2 Peel Hunt\uc2  thinks it could be \u8220\'20\'1Ca stretch\u8221\'20\'1D for the company to meet current forecasts, writes Harriet Russell.\par \par \uc2 Shares in retailer \uc2 N Brown\uc2  rose by 7 per cent after the group reported first-half results that were better than expected. However, expectations were low as a result of the extensive restructuring effort still under way at the company and last year\u8217\'20\'19s shock profit warning. Even on an adjusted basis, pre-tax profits for the half-year to August 29 fell 16 per cent to \u163\'00\'A335m.\par \par \uc2 The shares trade on a fairly undemanding forward price/earnings ratio of 14, and the dividend yield is generous, but investors have been burnt before on this one.\par \par \uc2 Chief executive \uc2 Angela Spindler\uc2  told investors to expect a stronger finish to the current financial year. That\u8217\'20\'19s because exceptional costs associated with the revamp \u8212\'20\'14 which involved 380 redundancies and the closure of 18 clearance stores in the first half, costing nearly \u163\'00\'A315m \u8212\'20\'14 should fall to between \u163\'00\'A32m and \u163\'00\'A33m in the second half.\par \par \uc2 As the operational transformation from a catalogue-led business to a digital retailer continues, \uc2 N Brown\uc2  is also changing the way it reports its financial results.\par \par \uc2 For the first time, the group split its revenues into \u8220\'20\'1Cproduct\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Cfinancial services\u8221\'20\'1D. The former grew 6.1 per cent during the first six months as digital sales took off, while the latter \u8212\'20\'14 which tracks the money \uc2 N Brown\uc2  makes on the credit it offers customers \u8212\'20\'14 dipped 0.4 per cent. Overall, like-for-like sales grew 3.1 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Peel Hunt\uc2  expects pre-tax profits of \u163\'00\'A386.6m for the current financial year, giving earnings per share of 24.6p, compared with \u163\'00\'A386.2m and 21p for the year ended February 2015.\par \par \uc2 Stock Screen: Cheap, High-Growth Aim Shares\par \par \uc2 The excitement the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) evokes in many investors often centres on the huge gains it is possible to make from finding the right go-to growth stock, writes Algy Hall.\par \par \uc2 My Cheap, High-Growth Aim Shares screen hit upon one such situation last year when it picked Trakm8. The shares delivered a flabbergasting total return of almost 250 per cent over the 12 months. Even after that amazing run, the shares can hardly be seen as expensive given that they make a reappearance among the screen\u8217\'20\'19s picks for this year, too.\par \par \uc2 There were actually nine shares from Aim that produced higher returns than Trakm8 over the 12 months, all of which considerably outflanked the biggest risers from the FTSE All-Share index\par \par \uc2 The success stories from last year\u8217\'20\'19s screen may present the case for Aim, but its failures also represent a case for the opposition. Among the big fallers from the 19 shares selected were a number of companies hit by the falling oil price and reduced capital expenditure by the industry.\par \par \uc2 The cumulative total return from the screen now stands at 4.8 per cent over the two years I\u8217\'20\'19ve run it, compared with a negative 5.8 per cent from the index. If I factor in a 2 per cent charge to account for the high dealing costs associated with small-caps, the cumulative total return drops to 2.7 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Relative to the market, the screen\u8217\'20\'19s performance can be said to be decent, but I feel it has yet to distinguish itself. That said, the methodology certainly seems capable of turning up some interesting situations \u8212\'20\'14 even if these do come accompanied by some less welcome investment ideas. The valuation criteria the screen uses is based on a cash and dividend-adjusted price-to-earnings-growth ratio, which I\u8217\'20\'19ve called a genuine value (GV) ratio. It is calculated as follows:\par \par \uc2 Enterprise-value-to-operating-profits ratio divided by dividend yield plus average forecast growth for the next two fiscal years\par \par \uc2 The rest of the criteria for the screen centre on a hunt for high forecast earnings growth, though growth that looks suspiciously high (an average of over 100 per cent for the next two financial years) is ignored. Broker forecasts for small-caps can be very subjective and the screen also seeks a bit of comfort from a sound balance sheet. Where earnings growth has been achieved historically, the screen wants to see that it is supported by sales growth. The full screening criteria are:\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Average forecast earnings per share (EPS) growth rate over the next two financial years of more than 20 per cent but less than 100 per cent.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Three-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) equal to at least half three-year EPS CAGR.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF A genuine value ratio of less than the median average.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Forward next 12-month price/earnings ratio outside the most expensive quarter of stocks screened.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Net debt/cash profit (Ebitda) of less than 2.5 times.\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF A current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of more than 1.\par \par \uc2 This year, 17 shares were highlighted by the screen. I\u8217\'20\'19ve taken a closer look at the shares showing the best momentum, offering the highest dividend yield:\par \par \uc2 32 Red \u8212\'20\'14 The UK\u8217\'20\'19s new point-of-consumption gambling tax has been a blow to online gambling companies. Unlike peers, 32 Red held off on heavy marketing ahead of the tax\u8217\'20\'19s introduction, which has left it with plenty of cash to recruit new players now the tax has been ushered in. Its efforts have been made all the more effective because many rivals have reined in their marketing spending.\par \par \uc2 Impressively, 32 Red has been managing to recruit new users without experiencing any serious deterioration in yield per user, and first-half casino revenues were 21 per cent ahead. The company, which is principally focused on the UK, is also seeing an improved performance from its Italian business which reported a 61 per cent revenue increase. The integration of Roxy Palace, acquired this year, is going well.\par \par \uc2 Belvoir \u8212\'20\'14 Lettings-focused estate agency chain Belvoir operates a franchise model. The beauty of a good franchise operation for shareholders is that a company can operate a large network of income-generating units with relatively minimal overheads \u8212\'20\'14 just the central costs needed to support franchisees. That means there\u8217\'20\'19s the potential for a large amount of earnings to be paid out as dividends, which is what Belvoir has been doing.\par \par \uc2 But while this means Belvoir\u8217\'20\'19s dividend payout is high, the dividend cover is slim. Profit growth is expected to boost cover, though, with broker \uc2 Cantor Fitzgerald\uc2  forecasting that earnings will be 1.3 times the level of the payout in 2016. And while last year\u8217\'20\'19s net operating cash inflow of \u163\'00\'A3250,000 didn\u8217\'20\'19t come close to covering the \u163\'00\'A31.6m paid out as dividends, a solid balance sheet provides some reassurance, with Cantor forecasting that net debt will represent less than half cash profits in 2016.\par \par \uc2 During its second half, the company has bought two letting agencies in the Midlands which has helped boost earnings growth expectations as well as helping advance its \u8220\'20\'1Cmulti-brand\u8221\'20\'1D strategy. The equity-funded deals are expected to mean Belvoir ends the year with 213 outlets, compared with 166 at the halfway stage.\par \par \uc2 Swallowfield\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 A new strategic plan means cosmetics manufacturer \uc2 Swallowfield\uc2  is showing early signs of promise and could drive substantial earnings growth over coming years. Indeed, broker N+1 Singer thinks in the best-case scenario the company could generate compound annual earnings growth in the three years to June 2018 of over 50 per cent taking EPS to 22p, which includes the tax benefits of past losses. That compares with 2015 EPS of 6.5p. For now, the broker\u8217\'20\'19s official 2018 forecast is 19.4p.\par \par \uc2 Forecasting so far out is necessarily a matter of extreme conjecture, but \uc2 Swallowfield\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s full-year results in September provided encouragement despite the negative impact of the euro\u8217\'20\'19s weakness. Plans to improve efficiency have helped the group put \u163\'00\'A3230,000 worth of cost savings in train and further savings of \u163\'00\'A3150,000 have been identified. The company also reported two contract wins in global brands, which helped validate increased focus on products where it has a strong advantage and sees good growth. There were also encouraging signs on the potential take-up of the owned brands the group has been developing and is getting ready to roll out.\par \par \uc2 Management\u8217\'20\'19s confidence in prospects was underlined by the decision to reinstate a dividend at 2p. Strong dividend growth is forecast with N+1 pencilling in a payment of 3p for the current financial year rising to 5p in 2018, which would be equivalent to a 3.6 per cent yield. The potential looks undeniably exciting.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020151016ebag0070u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

So how do banks build profits? By bending the rules.\par \par \uc2 Two of the top credit \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  companies are exploring new ways of assessing consumers' ability to handle loans, turning away from traditional sources of data such as credit cards and car loans to scour phone and utility bills, change-of-address records and information drawn from DVD clubs and suppliers of rent-to-own furniture.\par \par \uc2 The efforts could open up new classes of customer for the big US banks , and come as lenders struggle to generate steady profits in an environment of tightened regulation and ultra-low interest rates. In third-quarter results this week, the US's three biggest banks - \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  and \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  - have reported year-on-year declines in quarterly revenue .\par \par \uc2 One of the companies, Fico, has been working on a pilot project with a dozen US credit card companies, and now claims to have developed reliable ways to price loans to millions of people who have historically been off the grid.\par \par \uc2 Will Lansing , chief executive of the San Jose, California-based company, said Fico was increasingly looking at data on a spectrum: with credit card repayment history at one end - the most reliable guide to creditworthiness - and at the other, information volunteered on social media platforms such as \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "If you look at how many times a person says 'wasted' in their profile, it has some value in predicting whether they're going to repay their debt," he said. "It's not much, but it's more than zero."\par \par \uc2 Credit cards and car loans are likely to be among the bright spots in the US banks' third-quarter figures, with much of the growth driven by segments considered subprime . But mortgages and personal loans should be patchier, suggesting that many consumers have borrowed about as much as they can.\par \par \uc2 Aggregate household debt balances were unchanged in the second quarter at $11.85tn, according to the New York Federal Reserve, and remain more than 6 per cent below the pre-Lehman peak.\par \par \uc2 TransUnion, another credit-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group, has embarked on a project to tap alternative data sources to help people with marred records get better terms.\par \par \uc2 Both Fico and TransUnion say they are responding to demand from their ultimate customers, the banks, which worry that by declining people without traditional credit scores they are turning away potential sources of profit.\par \par \uc2 "The market was absolutely hungry for a solution," said \uc2 Jim Wehmann\uc2 , executive vice-president for scores at Fico.\par \par \uc2 Fico, which led the practice of custom scoring in the 1950s and whose scores are now used in about 90 per cent of credit decisions in the US, is pursuing its project in partnership with \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , one of the top three credit-reporting bureaux, and \uc2 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The new model gives high marks to people who have regularly paid bills, and have not moved around enough to suggest problems paying rent.\par \par \uc2 Some of the new credit-eligible customers are new to the country, some are young - and some have simply not borrowed enough to generate traditional files. But the alternative data suggest that many are a good credit risk. "We can now score the previously unscoreable," said Mr Wehmann.\par \par \uc2 Mike Mondelli, Chicago-based senior vice-president of alternative data services at TransUnion, said a broader approach to scoring could lead to cheaper loans for 23m consumers.\par \par \uc2 From the banks' point of view, he said, it is "good for adding more customers at an acceptable risk rate".\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020151016ebag00029\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 .'s new chief underwriter for its big business-insurance unit doesn't have underwriting training, and that is exactly what the company likes about him.\par \par \uc2 It would seem like just another job announcement when the New York company Thursday named a new chief underwriting officer for its big business-insurance unit, but the appointment of data scientist Madhu Tadikonda signifies sweeping change in the insurance industry.\par \par \uc2 AIG\uc2  says it isn't getting rid of traditional underwriters, but instead wants to augment their work with data science. Underwriters evaluate the risks of insuring a particular client or entity, determining the likelihood and potential for claims over the life of the policy.\par \par \uc2 The new chief underwriter is a 43-year-old \uc2 Princeton University\uc2  graduate who studied philosophy and later earned an M.B.A. from \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 . He worked previously at a consulting firm and in venture capital helping credit-card companies and retailers with computer modeling techniques for marketing and sales, among other assignments.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tadikonda joined \uc2 AIG\uc2  in 2013 as part of a \u8220\'20\'1Cscience team" committed to helping the global insurer apply computer-analytical techniques to its insurance business.\par \par \uc2 AIG Commercial Insurance Chief Executive \uc2 John Doyle\uc2  said that Mr. Tadikonda is unusual for the new assignment because he hadn't trained for years as an underwriter, but that is what he wanted.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI appointed him because of his unique background," he said in an interview. \u8220\'20\'1CI want him to challenge some of the conventional ways we've done things in the past, to look at our data assets in a different more creative way. We need people in key leadership roles that can help the team more broadly understand how we can do things in a different and better way."\par \par \uc2 AIG\uc2 's move \u8220\'20\'1Csignifies that insurance is \u8220\'20\'1Cin a new era, where the importance of sophisticated data analysis is becoming increasingly apparent," said \uc2 Robert Hartwig\uc2 , president of trade group \uc2 Insurance Information Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Across the insurance industry some companies still rely almost exclusively on underwriters' gut instincts. But AIG Chief Executive \uc2 Peter Hancock\uc2  has for several years championed use of science, data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to assess risk. In late 2011, he hired a \u8220\'20\'1CChief Science Officer" and the science team now tops 150 employees.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tadikonda, who worked alongside underwriters in his job on the science team, said that computer models won't replace human judgment.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople feel very comfortable popping up over their cubicle and asking the three people they sit next to whether they've seen an account like this or how they handled a situation," he said in an interview. \u8220\'20\'1CThe models crystallize or summarize that kind of experience across all of \uc2 AIG\uc2 's underwriters over a long period of time."\par \par \uc2 The models \u8220\'20\'1Caren't great" for all cases or conditions, so \u8220\'20\'1Cthat is where the human perspective is valuable," he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tadikonda replaces Tim Carter, who moves to another role at \uc2 AIG\uc2 . Mr. Carter had a more-traditional background: years of working up the ranks of underwriting departments, after earning a mathematics degree and becoming an actuary.\par \par \uc2 Write to Leslie Scism at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:leslie.scism@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 leslie.scism@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020151016ebag0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

So how do banks build profits? By bending the rules.\par \par \uc2 Two of the top credit \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  companies are exploring new ways of assessing consumers\u8217\'20\'19 ability to handle loans, turning away from traditional sources of data such as credit cards and car loans to scour phone and utility bills, change-of-address records and information drawn from DVD clubs and suppliers of rent-to-own furniture.\par \par \uc2 The efforts could open up new classes of customer for the big {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/US_banks"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 US banks  }}}\uc2 , and come as lenders struggle to generate steady profits in an environment of tightened regulation and ultra-low interest rates. In third-quarter results this week, the US\u8217\'20\'19s three biggest banks \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  and \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 have reported year-on-year declines in quarterly revenue.\par \par \uc2 One of the companies, FICO, has been working on a pilot project with a dozen US credit card companies, and now claims to have developed reliable ways to price loans to millions of people who have historically been off the grid.\par \par \uc2 Will Lansing, chief executive of the San Jose, California-based company, said FICO was increasingly looking at data on a spectrum: with credit card repayment history at one end \u8212\'20\'14 the most reliable guide to creditworthiness \u8212\'20\'14 and at the other, information volunteered on social media platforms such as \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you look at how many times a person says \u8216\'20\'18wasted\u8217\'20\'19 in their profile, it has some value in predicting whether they\u8217\'20\'19re going to repay their debt,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s not much, but it\u8217\'20\'19s more than zero.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Credit cards and car loans are likely to be among the bright spots in the US banks\u8217\'20\'19 third-quarter figures, with much of the growth driven by segments considered subprime. But mortgages and personal loans should be patchier, suggesting that many consumers across the US have borrowed about as much as they can.\par \par \uc2 Aggregate {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html#/2015/q2"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 household debt balances  }}}\uc2  were unchanged in the second quarter at $11.85tn, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve, and remain more than 6 per cent below the pre-Lehman peak.\par \par \uc2 TransUnion\uc2 , another credit-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  group, has embarked on a project to tap alternative data sources to help people with blemished records get better terms.\par \par \uc2 Both FICO and \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  say they are responding to demand from their ultimate customers, the banks, which worry that by declining people without traditional credit scores they are turning away potential sources of profit.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe market was absolutely hungry for a solution,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Jim Wehmann\uc2 , executive vice-president for scores at FICO.\par \par \uc2 FICO, which led the practice of custom scoring in the 1950s and whose scores are now used in about 90 per cent of credit decisions in the US, is pursuing its project in partnership with \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , one of the top three credit-reporting bureaux, and \uc2 LexisNexis Risk Solutions\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The new model gives high marks to people who have regularly paid phone and utility bills, and who have not moved around enough to suggest problems paying rent.\par \par \uc2 Some of the new credit-eligible customers are new to the country, some are young \u8212\'20\'14 and some have simply not borrowed enough to generate traditional files. But the alternative data suggest that many are a good credit risk. \u8220\'20\'1CWe can now score the previously unscoreable,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Wehmann.\par \par \uc2 Mike Mondelli, Chicago-based senior vice-president of alternative data services at TransUnion, said a broader approach to scoring could lead to cheaper loans for 23m consumers \u8212\'20\'14 typically \u8220\'20\'1Csomeone who has some bumps in the road on credit, but who pays more than the monthly minimum\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 From the banks\u8217\'20\'19 point of view, he said, it is \u8220\'20\'1Cgood for adding more customers at an acceptable risk rate\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170811ebaf005he\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Over three months, it is down 5.8 per cent, according to figures from FE \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \u163\'00\'A3634m Axa Framlington Biotech fund, an open-ended product held by many self-directed investors, meanwhile shed 12.2 per cent over the past month and 16.8 per cent over three months.\par \par \uc2 That followed years of steady rises, however. The \uc2 Axa\uc2  fund was up 280 per cent in the four years to July, meaning investors who entered the fund early will still have made substantial gains.\par \par \uc2 The biotech sell-off was sparked by comments from the US Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, who said she would look to reform drug pricing if she is elected president in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Commentators including \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2 , chair of the US Federal Reserve, had previously warned of stretched valuations in the fast-growing biotechnology sector, which looks to exploit biological processes to make drugs and other products.\par \par \uc2 Mr Woodford\u8217\'20\'19s head of investment communications, Mitchell Fraser-Jones, said in a trust update: \u8220\'20\'1CThe portfolio\u8217\'20\'19s US stocks were among the weakest performers, as sentiment towards US biotech remained sour.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGiven the way that the sector has traded this year, with very strong performance in the first half, the sell-off is perhaps unsurprising.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have, however, been disappointed that stocks such as Prothena and \uc2 Northwest Biotherapeutics\uc2  have become so embroiled in it \u8212\'20\'14 the valuation attached to their shares is very far from the bubble-like levels that some\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09peers have reached.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The company has seen nothing to change the fundamental investment case for these stocks, he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAlthough September was a disappointing month in performance terms, we retain absolute conviction in the long-term outlook for the trust,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Fraser-Jones added.\par \par \uc2 Patient Capital, which mainly invests in early-stage and early-growth companies \u8212\'20\'14 not exclusively in the biotech sector \u8212\'20\'14 is designed for investors who intend to commit their money for at least five years.\par \par \uc2 It has shed 2.2 per cent of net asset value since its launch in April, but is still trading at an 8.8 per cent premium because of investors\u8217\'20\'19 faith in Mr Woodford\u8217\'20\'19s extended record.\par \par \uc2 Linden Thomson, manager of the Axa biotech fund, said her fund does not hold Valeant or \uc2 Turing Pharmaceuticals\uc2 , two of the companies most associated with drug price inflation, since she does not classify them as biotechnology companies.\par \par \uc2 Like Mr Woodford, she has made no significant changes to her portfolio \u8212\'20\'14 whose largest holdings are \uc2 Celgene Corp\uc2  and \uc2 Gilead Sciences\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 as a result of recent market swings.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe believe that fundamentals remain solid for this sector and maintain our forecast of 20 per cent growth over the next two years,\u8221\'20\'1D said Ms Thomson.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn an environment concerned about growth, the biotech sector is one area which looks likely to continue to grow strongly through various market cycles.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Demographic trends and demand from countries outside the US and western Europe will continue to support the industry, she added, although it does face question marks over the sustainability of high drug prices, and must negotiate competition from generic drugs.\par \par \uc2 Rival healthcare funds have also taken a hit: Polar Capital\u8217\'20\'19s biotechnology fund shed 13.4 per cent over the three months to the end of September, while biotech funds run by Candriam Investors Group and Pictet Asset Management were down 14.7 and 13.4 per cent respectively.\par \par \uc2 Among trusts, Frostrow\u8217\'20\'19s Biotech Growth Trust is down 23.5 per cent over three months, and the Worldwide Healthcare Trust, run by the same company, has shed 13.3 per cent of its value.\par \par \uc2 Polar Capital Global Healthcare Growth and Income declined 8.78 per cent over three months, while rival SV Life Sciences International Biotechnology Trust shed 16.4 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Beckwith, director of manager research at Morningstar, said that biotech shares\u8217\'20\'19 fall was \u8220\'20\'1Ca necessary correction after a phenomenal bull run\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s had such a strong run and made some much money that the first time there was some bad news, people were bound to take some profits,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 The role of biotech in an individual investor\u8217\'20\'19s portfolio should depend on their risk appetite, he added. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a high-risk, high-return sector. They need to understand how much they can afford to lose and whether they want to take on this sort of risk.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020151015ebaf00461\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

She has a conventional career behind her, spanning stints at Lloyds, \uc2 Standard Chartered\uc2 , \uc2 UBS\uc2  and \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2 , culminating as chief operating officer of Allied Irish.\par \par \uc2 Now, however, Ms Boden has moved into the vanguard of the digital revolution. As chief executive of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://starlingbank.co.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Starling Bank}}}\uc2 , a London-based start-up, she believes the future of high-street banking is not on the high street at all, but on mobile-only platforms such as the one she is midway through setting up.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBig banks are far too complicated. All their branches and products and legacy systems are very inefficient,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms Boden says.\par \par \uc2 And she is not alone in holding such views. Across the financial services sector, but particularly in banking, start-ups are endeavouring to shake up a staid industry.\par \par \uc2 Three connected complications make this a rich vein to tap. In the boom times of the late 1990s and early 2000s, many banks failed to invest in technology, preferring simply to ride the wave and maximise profits. During the financial crisis, meanwhile, there was no time to think of tech investment. And in the post-crisis period there has been no money. The net result across much of the world is a banking system that is creaking at the joints.\par \par \uc2 The industry has been distracted for years, says \uc2 Piyush Gupta\uc2 , chief executive of DBS, Singapore\u8217\'20\'19s biggest lender. \u8220\'20\'1CCollectively, we have taken our eyes off Net 2.0.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Groups that expanded aggressively through acquisition have some of the biggest challenges thanks to a common failure to integrate multiple IT systems. Kartik Ramakrishnan, senior vice-president at \uc2 Capgemini\uc2 , a consultancy, says the task in hand is vast.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe financial services industry is one of the biggest spenders on technology,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, the majority of this spend is on maintenance activities, largely due to the investment required to keep legacy systems operational.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2 , which led a three-way \u8364\'20\'AC71bn {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/tag/abn-amro/page/2/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 acquisition of ABN Amro}}}\uc2  just before the financial crisis, has become synonymous with IT failures. After {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.rbs.com/news/2014/11/rbs-reaches-it-incident-settlement.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 RBS\u8217\'20\'19s systems fell down}}}\uc2  in the summer of 2012 it took weeks to clear a backlog of 100m unprocessed transactions that froze customers out of their accounts.\par \par \uc2 Despite a \u163\'00\'A3750m programme of investment, \uc2 RBS\uc2  was hit by another embarrassing glitch this summer.\par \par \uc2 Some of the biggest banks with the greatest need to make amends for past under-investment are now spending billions of dollars a year \u8212\'20\'14 not just to maintain old systems, but to try to upgrade them at last.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is an urgent need for the traditional players to acknowledge the presence of new digital challengers,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Ramakrishnan.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C[Banks need] to develop more agile, responsive IT to support faster time to market, better product innovation and improved customer service.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 DBS of Singapore is among the banks convinced it still has time to make amends. Next-generation technology is now \u8220\'20\'1Cfront and centre of our priorities\u8221\'20\'1D, says Mr Gupta, who adds that the timescale for getting it done is limited.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you don\u8217\'20\'19t get the digital transformation right in the next five years, you will be history,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 As with other bank bosses, Mr Gupta is alarmed at the inroads made into traditional banking territory by non-banks, particularly technological behemoths, from Alibaba in China to Apple across much of the rest of the world.\par \par \uc2 Their expansion into payment services is particularly worrying for the banks because it directly challenges the banks\u8217\'20\'19 relationships with their customers.\par \par \uc2 Other core banking activities \u8212\'20\'14 such as lending \u8212\'20\'14 are under attack from technology start-ups, particularly so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders.\par \par \uc2 By using sophisticated software to match people or companies with money to lend to those who want to borrow, they can often offer loans more cheaply and cut out the middlemen bankers. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are steadily taking their customers,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Giles Andrews\uc2 , co-founder of Zopa, the world\u8217\'20\'19s oldest P2P lender, who adds: \u8220\'20\'1CWe are doubling our market share every year.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A handful of initiatives pose similar threats to other areas of the traditional financial services market.\par \par \uc2 In asset management, for example, Alibaba has attracted vast inflows across China, thanks to the combined power of its technology and its dominant brand name.\par \par \uc2 In insurance, a patchwork of initiatives has spread across broking and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is in banking services, however, that the greatest changes are afoot. Here, technology companies, large and small, have been helped in their competitive efforts by the increasing regulatory constraints imposed on traditional banks in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.\par \par \uc2 While banks have been forced to accept tougher regulatory capital requirements, making much of their core lending more expensive, challengers from outside banking are only lightly regulated.\par \par \uc2 In some countries, politicians have even gone out of their way to favour non-banks, conscious that there are votes to be won in making life harder for the kinds of banking institutions that were so closely identified with the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 In the UK, for example, P2P lending is about to be given the tax breaks and government imprimatur of an Isa, a tax-efficient savings vehicle. At the same time, a new 8 per cent bank supertax has been announced for old-style banks.\par \par \uc2 The banking industry is not taking the assault lying down. With the trauma of the crisis, and much of the expense of post-crisis regulation now absorbed, the stronger banks have not only begun to invest heavily in unseen back-office IT. There is also a good deal of customer-facing tech investment, ensuring that some banks, at least, are keeping pace with upstart challengers.\par \par \uc2 A number of models are emerging. Spanish lenders \uc2 BBVA\uc2  and Santander have each set up pools of funding to buy up tech-based firms. \uc2 BBVA\uc2  even went so far as to acquire Simple, one of the more eye-catching of the US start-up lenders. Meanwhile, \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  has established Hello, a mobile-focused lender operating across a large chunk of the eurozone.\par \par \uc2 For Ms Boden at Starling, such initiatives miss the point because, in most cases, the high-tech front ends of the new style still rely on old bank infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Of her own enterprise she says: \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re different. We\u8217\'20\'19re going to be able to offer free current accounts without subsidy from other products.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s because we don\u8217\'20\'19t have the big network overheads of branches and legacy systems.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 If she is right, then perhaps the greatest potential for a more modern form of banking may lie in emerging markets, where old-style infrastructure was never built.\par \par \uc2 Across Africa, for example, payment services using basic mobiles rather than smartphones are already widely available. In such markets, tech-savvy start-up lenders could do very well indeed.\par \par \uc2 Many believe, however, that the current phase of traditional financial services being challenged by upstart technology companies will morph into a new world order, in which the best of the old operators integrate the latest technology, either under their own steam or via acquisition.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe financial services industry is at a crossroads,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Ramakrishnan. \u8220\'20\'1CBut we firmly believe that some firms will retake the initiative and challenge the new digital challengers at their own game.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIndeed, we may see symbiotic relationships emerge, where both established firms and challengers come together to create a mutually beneficial partnership.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020151014ebae000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 To judge by her CV, \uc2 Anne Boden\uc2  is an old-style banker to the core. She has a conventional career behind her, spanning stints at Lloyds, \uc2 Standard Chartered\uc2 , \uc2 UBS\uc2  and \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2 , culminating as chief operating officer of Allied Irish.\par \par \uc2 Now, however, Ms Boden has moved into the vanguard of the digital revolution. As chief executive of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://starlingbank.co.uk/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Starling Bank}}}\uc2 , a London-based start-up, she believes the future of high-street banking is not on the high street at all, but on mobile-only platforms such as the one she is midway through setting up.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBig banks are far too complicated. All their branches and products and legacy systems are very inefficient,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms Boden says.\par \par \uc2 And she is not alone in holding such views. Across the financial services sector, but particularly in banking, start-ups are endeavouring to shake up a staid industry.\par \par \uc2 Three connected complications make this a rich vein to tap. In the boom times of the late 1990s and early 2000s, many banks failed to invest in technology, preferring simply to ride the wave and maximise profits. During the financial crisis, meanwhile, there was no time to think of tech investment. And in the post-crisis period there has been no money. The net result across much of the world is a banking system that is creaking at the joints.\par \par \uc2 The industry has been distracted for years, says \uc2 Piyush Gupta\uc2 , chief executive of DBS, Singapore\u8217\'20\'19s biggest lender. \u8220\'20\'1CCollectively, we have taken our eyes off Net 2.0.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Groups that expanded aggressively through acquisition have some of the biggest challenges thanks to a common failure to integrate multiple IT systems. Kartik Ramakrishnan, senior vice-president at \uc2 Capgemini\uc2 , a consultancy, says the task in hand is vast.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe financial services industry is one of the biggest spenders on technology,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, the majority of this spend is on maintenance activities, largely due to the investment required to keep legacy systems operational.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2 , which led a three-way \u8364\'20\'AC71bn {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/tag/abn-amro/page/2/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 acquisition of ABN Amro}}}\uc2  just before the financial crisis, has become synonymous with IT failures. After {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.rbs.com/news/2014/11/rbs-reaches-it-incident-settlement.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 RBS\u8217\'20\'19s systems fell down}}}\uc2  in the summer of 2012 it took weeks to clear a backlog of 100m unprocessed transactions that froze customers out of their accounts.\par \par \uc2 Despite a \u163\'00\'A3750m programme of investment, \uc2 RBS\uc2  was hit by another embarrassing glitch this summer.\par \par \uc2 Some of the biggest banks with the greatest need to make amends for past under-investment are now spending billions of dollars a year \u8212\'20\'14 not just to maintain old systems, but to try to upgrade them at last.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is an urgent need for the traditional players to acknowledge the presence of new digital challengers,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Ramakrishnan.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C[Banks need] to develop more agile, responsive IT to support faster time to market, better product innovation and improved customer service.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 DBS of Singapore is among the banks convinced it still has time to make amends. Next-generation technology is now \u8220\'20\'1Cfront and centre of our priorities\u8221\'20\'1D, says Mr Gupta, who adds that the timescale for getting it done is limited.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf you don\u8217\'20\'19t get the digital transformation right in the next five years, you will be history,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 As with other bank bosses, Mr Gupta is alarmed at the inroads made into traditional banking territory by non-banks, particularly technological behemoths, from Alibaba in China to Apple across much of the rest of the world.\par \par \uc2 Their expansion into payment services is particularly worrying for the banks because it directly challenges the banks\u8217\'20\'19 relationships with their customers.\par \par \uc2 Other core banking activities \u8212\'20\'14 such as lending \u8212\'20\'14 are under attack from technology start-ups, particularly so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders.\par \par \uc2 By using sophisticated software to match people or companies with money to lend to those who want to borrow, they can often offer loans more cheaply and cut out the middlemen bankers. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are steadily taking their customers,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Giles Andrews\uc2 , co-founder of Zopa, the world\u8217\'20\'19s oldest P2P lender, who adds: \u8220\'20\'1CWe are doubling our market share every year.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A handful of initiatives pose similar threats to other areas of the traditional financial services market.\par \par \uc2 In asset management, for example, Alibaba has attracted vast inflows across China, thanks to the combined power of its technology and its dominant brand name.\par \par \uc2 In insurance, a patchwork of initiatives has spread across broking and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is in banking services, however, that the greatest changes are afoot. Here, technology companies, large and small, have been helped in their competitive efforts by the increasing regulatory constraints imposed on traditional banks in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.\par \par \uc2 While banks have been forced to accept tougher regulatory capital requirements, making much of their core lending more expensive, challengers from outside banking are only lightly regulated.\par \par \uc2 In some countries, politicians have even gone out of their way to favour non-banks, conscious that there are votes to be won in making life harder for the kinds of banking institutions that were so closely identified with the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 In the UK, for example, P2P lending is about to be given the tax breaks and government imprimatur of an Isa, a tax-efficient savings vehicle. At the same time, a new 8 per cent bank supertax has been announced for old-style banks.\par \par \uc2 The banking industry is not taking the assault lying down. With the trauma of the crisis, and much of the expense of post-crisis regulation now absorbed, the stronger banks have not only begun to invest heavily in unseen back-office IT. There is also a good deal of customer-facing tech investment, ensuring that some banks, at least, are keeping pace with upstart challengers.\par \par \uc2 A number of models are emerging. Spanish lenders \uc2 BBVA\uc2  and Santander have each set up pools of funding to buy up tech-based firms. \uc2 BBVA\uc2  even went so far as to acquire Simple, one of the more eye-catching of the US start-up lenders. Meanwhile, \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  has established Hello, a mobile-focused lender operating across a large chunk of the eurozone.\par \par \uc2 For Ms Boden at Starling, such initiatives miss the point because, in most cases, the high-tech front ends of the new style still rely on old bank infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Of her own enterprise she says: \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re different. We\u8217\'20\'19re going to be able to offer free current accounts without subsidy from other products.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s because we don\u8217\'20\'19t have the big network overheads of branches and legacy systems.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 If she is right, then perhaps the greatest potential for a more modern form of banking may lie in emerging markets, where old-style infrastructure was never built.\par \par \uc2 Across Africa, for example, payment services using basic mobiles rather than smartphones are already widely available. In such markets, tech-savvy start-up lenders could do very well indeed.\par \par \uc2 Many believe, however, that the current phase of traditional financial services being challenged by upstart technology companies will morph into a new world order, in which the best of the old operators integrate the latest technology, either under their own steam or via acquisition.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe financial services industry is at a crossroads,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Ramakrishnan. \u8220\'20\'1CBut we firmly believe that some firms will retake the initiative and challenge the new digital challengers at their own game.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIndeed, we may see symbiotic relationships emerge, where both established firms and challengers come together to create a mutually beneficial partnership.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020151014ebae000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But now connected devices on our bodies could help us access online banking systems.\par \par \uc2 Nymi, taken from the Greek suffix -onym for name, is experimenting with a system that lets people prove who they are with their heartbeat. Halifax, part of UK bank Lloyds, Canada's RBC and \uc2 MasterCard\uc2  are partners.\par \par \uc2 Everyone's heartbeat is individual to them, so by wearing a wristband that transmits the signal to the device being used for online banking, or even a till at a checkout, you can prove your identity.\par \par \uc2 Shawn Chance, vice-president of marketing and business development at Nymi, says the company aims to "make all the passwords go away". "The idea of a password being used for security is almost eroded," he says. He adds people tend to keep a note of them in insecure places.\par \par \uc2 Banks want to better secure their systems from hackers, who like latter-day bank robbers are attracted to the money in their - now digital - vaults. There are also more sophisticated nation state attackers who desire not only cash, but data and seek to make a political impact by targeting an adversary's most prestigious financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 Many banks are cautious about putting any extra burden on consumers, already stressed by remembering codes and passwords, and who prioritise convenient and easy access to their money over security.\par \par \uc2 Even Nymi is unlikely to be accepted as a wearable given its limited use. "We don't have any illusions that, in order for the device to be useful for an everyday person, it has to do a lot more than get you into online banking," Mr Chance says. So the company is making wristbands for employees that allow or restrict access to parts of the office or IT network as an additional feature.\par \par \uc2 Banking is often held up as the sector that has devoted great amounts of time and resources to cyber security. But the threat facing institutions is also changing fast, forcing them to regularly seek out new solutions.\par \par \uc2 Tammy Moskites, chief information security officer at Venafi, a digital security company that works with four of the top five US banks, says the types of attacks have changed since she worked in information security for banks six years ago.\par \par \uc2 In the past, she says: "What we found . . . was attacks were on online banking, wire transfers, man-in-the-middle phishing-type attacks, about intercepting or redirecting money, sending it to Nigeria, rather than to payroll."\par \par \uc2 Now attackers are using techniques that are harder to detect: "The nation state type of attack is just stealing this information to show they can do it . . . the money is usually redirected to support the crazies of the world, terrorists, people causing havoc."\par \par \uc2 But as banks have moved towards greater encryption in the effort to keep data safe - even if it is stolen - they have created another problem. They cannot see what is moving in and out of their networks because it is encrypted.\par \par \uc2 "Banks, as well as other companies in general, encrypt more and more of their data," Ms Moskites says. "In the past, it was just the most critical information, things required by regulators, now they are going above and beyond that. However, when it is leaving their environment, the tools notoriously don't see that data, [making banks blind] to potential problems."\par \par \uc2 Some banks are trying to address this by making sure they know what is encrypted and why and are looking at ways to decrypt it briefly as it leaves the network.\par \par \uc2 Mark Nicholson, chief operating officer at Deloitte cyber security practice Vigilant, says banks are increasingly turning to \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to try to identify who is moving money without placing a burden on their customers.\par \par \uc2 "What we're seeing is an unwillingness to implement technologies which would cause friction to the consumer," he says. "So they are using \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  on transactions to understand if certain types of transaction look anomalous - from a profile and history of the times of day you usually transact, from which general internet provider address, browser, machine details, etc."\par \par \uc2 US-based Vasco Data Security works with more than half of the world's banks to prevent account takeover and transaction tampering for online and mobile banking. \uc2 John Gunn\uc2 , a vice-president at Vasco, says US consumers are more focused on convenience and service than security because they have no lasting exposure to losses from hacking or fraud. "Here in the US, consumers don't care as much because their status as a victim is quickly and painlessly alleviated by their bank, and usually within 24 hours," he says.\par \par \uc2 As a result, Vasco has to focus on verifying customers' identities discreetly and it has about 20 ways to authenticate a mobile banking customer. "Most of them are done in the background, without the user even knowing they are happening," Mr Gunn says.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020151014ebae00007\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

She has a conventional career behind her, spanning stints at Lloyds, \uc2 Standard Chartered\uc2 , \uc2 UBS\uc2  and \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2 , culminating as chief operating officer of Allied Irish.\par \par \uc2 Now, however, Ms Boden has moved into the vanguard of the digital revolution. As chief executive of Starling Bank , a London-based start-up, she believes the future of high-street banking is not on the high street at all, but on mobile-only platforms such as the one she is midway through setting up.\par \par \uc2 "Big banks are far too complicated. All their branches and products and legacy systems are very inefficient," Ms Boden says.\par \par \uc2 And she is not alone in holding such views. Across the financial services sector, but particularly in banking, start-ups are endeavouring to shake up a staid industry.\par \par \uc2 Three connected complications make this a rich vein to tap. In the boom times of the late 1990s and early 2000s, many banks failed to invest in technology, preferring simply to ride the wave and maximise profits. During the financial crisis, meanwhile, there was no time to think of tech investment. And in the post-crisis period there has been no money. The net result across much of the world is a banking system that is creaking at the joints.\par \par \uc2 The industry has been distracted for years, says \uc2 Piyush Gupta\uc2 , chief executive of DBS, Singapore's biggest lender. "Collectively, we have taken our eyes off Net 2.0."\par \par \uc2 Groups that expanded aggressively through acquisition have some of the biggest challenges thanks to a common failure to integrate multiple IT systems. Kartik Ramakrishnan, senior vice-president at \uc2 Capgemini\uc2 , a consultancy, says the task in hand is vast.\par \par \uc2 "The financial services industry is one of the biggest spenders on technology," he says. "However, the majority of this spend is on maintenance activities, largely due to the investment required to keep legacy systems operational."\par \par \uc2 Royal Bank of Scotland\uc2 , which led a three-way \u8364\'20\'AC71bn acquisition of \uc2 ABN Amro\uc2  just before the financial crisis, has become synonymous with IT failures. After RBS's systems fell down in the summer of 2012 it took weeks to clear a backlog of 100m unprocessed transactions that froze customers out of their accounts.\par \par \uc2 Despite a \u163\'00\'A3750m programme of investment, RBS was hit by another embarrassing glitch this summer .\par \par \uc2 Some of the biggest banks with the greatest need to make amends for past under-investment are now spending billions of dollars a year - not just to maintain old systems, but to try to upgrade them at last.\par \par \uc2 "There is an urgent need for the traditional players to acknowledge the presence of new digital challengers," says Mr Ramakrishnan.\par \par \uc2 "[Banks need] to develop more agile, responsive IT to support faster time to market, better product innovation and improved customer service."\par \par \uc2 DBS of Singapore is among the banks convinced it still has time to make amends. Next-generation technology is now "front and centre of our priorities", says Mr Gupta, who adds that the timescale for getting it done is limited.\par \par \uc2 "If you don't get the digital transformation right in the next five years, you will be history," he says.\par \par \uc2 As with other bank bosses, Mr Gupta is alarmed at the inroads made into traditional banking territory by non-banks, particularly technological behemoths, from Alibaba in China to Apple across much of the rest of the world.\par \par \uc2 Their expansion into payment services is particularly worrying for the banks because it directly challenges the banks' relationships with their customers.\par \par \uc2 Other core banking activities - such as lending - are under attack from technology start-ups, particularly so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders.\par \par \uc2 By using sophisticated software to match people or companies with money to lend to those who want to borrow, they can often offer loans more cheaply and cut out the middlemen bankers. "We are steadily taking their customers," says Giles Andrews, co-founder of Zopa, the world's oldest P2P lender, who adds: "We are doubling our market share every year."\par \par \uc2 A handful of initiatives pose similar threats to other areas of the traditional financial services market.\par \par \uc2 In asset management, for example, Alibaba has attracted vast inflows across China, thanks to the combined power of its technology and its dominant brand name.\par \par \uc2 In insurance, a patchwork of initiatives has spread across broking and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is in banking services, however, that the greatest changes are afoot. Here, technology companies, large and small, have been helped in their competitive efforts by the increasing regulatory constraints imposed on traditional banks in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.\par \par \uc2 While banks have been forced to accept tougher regulatory capital requirements, making much of their core lending more expensive, challengers from outside banking are only lightly regulated.\par \par \uc2 In some countries, politicians have even gone out of their way to favour non-banks, conscious that there are votes to be won in making life harder for the kinds of banking institutions that were so closely identified with the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 In the UK, for example, P2P lending is about to be given the tax breaks and government imprimatur of an Isa, a tax-efficient savings vehicle. At the same time, a new 8 per cent bank supertax has been announced for old-style banks.\par \par \uc2 The banking industry is not taking the assault lying down. With the trauma of the crisis, and much of the expense of post-crisis regulation now absorbed, the stronger banks have not only begun to invest heavily in unseen back-office IT. There is also a good deal of customer-facing tech investment, ensuring that some banks, at least, are keeping pace with upstart challengers.\par \par \uc2 A number of models are emerging. Spanish lenders \uc2 BBVA\uc2  and Santander have each set up pools of funding to buy up tech-based firms. \uc2 BBVA\uc2  even went so far as to acquire Simple, one of the more eye-catching of the US start-up lenders. Meanwhile, \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  has established Hello, a mobile-focused lender operating across a large chunk of the eurozone.\par \par \uc2 For Ms Boden at Starling, such initiatives miss the point because, in most cases, the high-tech front ends of the new style still rely on old bank infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Of her own enterprise she says: "We're different. We're going to be able to offer free current accounts without subsidy from other products.\par \par \uc2 "That's because we don't have the big network overheads of branches and legacy systems."\par \par \uc2 If she is right, then perhaps the greatest potential for a more modern form of banking may lie in emerging markets, where old-style infrastructure was never built.\par \par \uc2 Across Africa, for example, payment services using basic mobiles rather than smartphones are already widely available. In such markets, tech-savvy start-up lenders could do very well indeed.\par \par \uc2 Many believe, however, that the current phase of traditional financial services being challenged by upstart technology companies will morph into a new world order, in which the best of the old operators integrate the latest technology, either under their own steam or via acquisition.\par \par \uc2 "The financial services industry is at a crossroads," says Mr Ramakrishnan. "But we firmly believe that some firms will retake the initiative and challenge the new digital challengers at their own game.\par \par \uc2 "Indeed, we may see symbiotic relationships emerge, where both established firms and challengers come together to create a mutually beneficial partnership."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020151014ebae00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business\par {\*\bkmkstart toc14}{\*\bkmkend toc14}\b \uc2 Marketers May Be Falling Out of Love With Product Placement; Product placement on broadcast TV has been on the decline for several years.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Suzanne Vranica   \par \uc2 647 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 October 2015\par 22:30\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ad clutter is generally increasing as marketers find more and more places to peddle their products. But there is one place where ads are declining: smack in the middle of prime time TV shows.\par \par \uc2 The number of product placements appearing during the first week of the new broadcast season declined 45% to 104, compared to last year's premiere week, according to Nielsen.\par \par \uc2 The number of in-program placements has declined for several seasons. There were 4,455 product placements made during last year's broadcast TV season, a 3% drop from the year-earlier season and down 20% from the 2012-2013 season.\par \par \uc2 Why the drop? Some blame the emergence of new advertising platforms.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere are so many more options available for advertising now and every year its grows," said Chad Dreas, Nielsen's managing director of media \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , pointing to the growth of digital advertising and social media advertising.\par \par \uc2 Cost is also keeping advertisers at bay. Integrations are a \u8220\'20\'1Cbig commitment," said Andy Donchin, chief investment officer at Amplify US, an ad-buying unit of \uc2 Dentsu\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThere is an out of pocket premium" that advertisers have to pay that sometimes can be hard to justify, he added.\par \par \uc2 Still, some of the world's biggest brands routinely use the ad tactic. Apple, \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 , Chevrolet, \uc2 Ford\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  were the largest users of product placement last year on broadcast TV. Combined, those brands were responsible for 30% of all in-program placements during the last broadcast season, Nielsen said.\par \par \uc2 Product placement has been a part of the TV business since the early days of the medium. About a decade ago, the practice exploded as marketers saw it as a way to sidestep the damaging effects of TV commercial-skipping devices. At the same time, TV networks jumped on the opportunity and now they aggressively package product plugs into many of their ad deals.\par \par \uc2 That took the product placement business, which had been dominated by small firms that had relationships with set designers and Hollywood show runners, to a whole new level. Product plugs became more pronounced and elaborate. Advertisers were no longer satisfied with having a character on a show reach for a branded soda can \u8211\'20\'13 many sought bigger brand integrations that included getting the product or its attributes mentioned on the show. Indeed, there were roughly 8,500 in-program placements during the 2009-2010 broadcast season, Nielsen said.\par \par \uc2 Despite the recent decline in plugs, there is evidence to suggest that many advertisers still believe product placements works. During Stephen Colbert's debut as the host of \uc2 CBS\uc2 's \u8220\'20\'1CLate Show" last month, Mr. Colbert spent several minutes poking fun at the fact that he was obligated to promote Sabra roasted red pepper humus on the air.\par \par \uc2 Next week viewers will see messages from health insurer Cigna Corp. baked into some programs airing on \uc2 Walt Disney\uc2 's ABC. In an effort to promote how important getting a check-up from your doctor is, the insurance company worked with ABC to have some cast members of \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 Jimmy Kimmel\uc2  Live" swap jobs, on air, so they can go to the doctor for a checkup.\par \par \uc2 Cigna\uc2  said having its pitch embedded or mentioned in a program helps a TV viewer to better remember the message. The product integration \u8220\'20\'1Camplifies the commercial message," said Stephen Cassell, global branding officer at Cigna.\par \par \uc2 A recent Nielsen study found that when a product plug aired in the same program as standard commercials for the same brand, the ability for a consumer\u8212\'20\'14ages 18 to 49\u8212\'20\'14to remember the brand increased 18%. Product integrations \u8220\'20\'1Cadd value and increase the effectiveness" of ads, added Mr. Dreas at Nielsen.\par \par \uc2 Write to Suzanne Vranica at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:suzanne.vranica@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 suzanne.vranica@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020151013ebad008ke\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

"When you think about the use of technology, the quantitative use of risk, in margin for collateral and the pieces of the post 2008 world, there is a lot of analysis required. It needs an analytic mind but also someone comfortable with technology and software. Yaacov has the toolbox to make a big difference."\par \par \uc2 Turnover at the unit rose 17 per cent to $82.3m in the three months to June 30, driven by new business wins and acquisitions. Excluding deals, Markit\u8217\'20\'19s Solutions business has recorded organic growth of 13 per cent in the first six months of the year.\par \par \uc2 Mr Mutnikas has worked as a senior adviser to the Bank of England on systemic risk.

He doesn't say which instruments they should use or how they should use them.\par \par \uc2 Governments are used to investing in infrastructure, roads, bridges and even housing. It makes good press to cut a ribbon opening a new railway line wearing a yellow hard hat. In today's post-industrial world though, growth is generated researching, designing and developing monoclonal antibodies, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  software, high temperature superconductors, social media platforms and similar products combining low physical capital and high intellectual capital. Outside a few well-known clusters, there is an acute shortage of capital managed by erstwhile serial entrepreneurs-turned- fund managers working with intellectually curious engineers and scientists to rapidly create products with the potential to create growth of significance to gross domestic product.\par \par \uc2 It is politically hard for civil servants to invest public money creating the seeds of such growth, yet professionally managed seed funds are one of the few instruments with the potential to give access to the wealth currently only available to the few lucky enough to thrive in the golden tech clusters.\par \par \uc2 Now is the time for central banks and governments to absorb the risk premium of creating equity seed capital funds with the scale, ambition and professionalism needed to stimulate sustained post-industrial growth.\par \par \uc2 Chris Martin\par \par \uc2 Belmont-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020151009eba90001m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

Lublin   \par \uc2 867 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 October 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)\par \uc2 WSJE\par B3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   \par \par \uc2 Dell Inc\uc2 . and private-equity firm Silver Lake are in advanced talks to buy \uc2 EMC Corp\uc2 ., according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would rank as the biggest technology-industry takeover ever and remove questions about \uc2 EMC\uc2  that have hung over the data-storage company for more than a year.\par \par \uc2 A deal for \uc2 EMC\uc2  could be reached within a week, according to some of the people, though it is also possible one won't be reached. The deal currently being discussed calls for the buyers to spin off some of \uc2 EMC\uc2 's \uc2 VMware Inc\uc2 . unit, some of the people said. \uc2 EMC\uc2  has been considering several options since The Wall Street Journal reported it was doing a strategic review last year, but this now seems to be the most likely outcome.\par \par \uc2 Shares of \uc2 EMC\uc2  were up 4.8% in middaytrading Thursday after the Journal reported on the possible deal. \uc2 EMC\uc2  has a market capitalization of $50 billion, and a deal would likely be valued at about that level, the person said. Chip maker \uc2 Avago Technologies Ltd\uc2 .'s pending $37 billion agreement to buy \uc2 Broadcom Corp\uc2 . is currently the largest pure-tech takeover ever struck.\par \par \uc2 There has been a wave of tech and other takeovers this year, and merger volume overall is running at a near-record pace.\par \par \uc2 EMC\uc2  has been under pressure to boost its stock price since last year, when activist hedge fund \uc2 Elliott Management Corp\uc2 . took a roughly 2% stake in the company and urged it to spin off VMware. \uc2 EMC\uc2  owns 80% of VMware, which has a market value of $34 billion. An arrangement struck in January between Elliott and Hopkinton, Mass.-based \uc2 EMC\uc2  that had barred the fund from publicly pressuring \uc2 EMC\uc2  expired last month. Elliott has since stayed quiet.\par \par \uc2 Analysts have said it would make sense for Dell, which was taken private in a landmark leveraged buyout in 2013, to buy \uc2 EMC\uc2 's \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 -storage operation.\par \par \uc2 Dell\uc2  went private in a roughly $25 billion buyout by its founder, \uc2 Michael Dell\uc2 , and private-equity firm Silver Lake. Out of the public spotlight, it has pivoted from personal computers, which are facing headwinds from tablet computers and smartphones, toward more-profitable areas such as storage and security.\par \par \uc2 A deal with \uc2 EMC\uc2  would cement Dell's transition from a consumer-facing company to one focused on technology for large companies -- a far cry from the company Mr. Dell founded in his University of Texas dorm room in 1984.\par \par \uc2 Dell\uc2  still carries more than $11.7 billion in debt, according to FactSet. It wasn't immediately clear how it would finance a potential purchase of \uc2 EMC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 EMC\uc2  reports its quarterly earnings on Oct. 21, and some analysts have speculated that the company has until then to announce a deal or risk a proxy fight. An acquisition or other big deal for \uc2 EMC\uc2  could also solve another question that has been looming over the company: the fate of its chief executive, \uc2 Joe Tucci\uc2 . Mr. Tucci indicated he might retire at the beginning of the year, though to date no succession plan has been announced.\par \par \uc2 EMC\uc2  had held talks with Dell, the Journal reported in September 2014. \uc2 EMC\uc2  also had been in discussions about a merger with \uc2 Hewlett-Packard Co\uc2 ., which ended before \uc2 H-P\uc2  announced plans to split itself in two in October 2014.\par \par \uc2 EMC\uc2  was once synonymous with data storage. The company was a darling of the tech boom -- its shares were one of the best performers in the S&P 500 in the 1990s -- but it has fallen on harder times since. The shares have fallen 13% this year and are little changed from when Elliott began its campaign. In July, the company reported a 17% drop in quarterly profit and lowered its full-year outlook.\par \par \uc2 Storage has been a drag on earnings, a development attributed by \uc2 EMC\uc2 executive David Goulden\uc2  on the company's most recent quarterly conference call to a "secular shift to the new digital age, defined by cloud, mobile, social and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 ." Revenue growth at \uc2 EMC\uc2 's storage division has slowed from a 16% increase between 2010 and 2011 to a 2% gain between 2013 and 2014, according to regulatory filings. It competes with companies including \uc2 NetApp Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Hewlett-Packard\uc2  and \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 . A new competitor, \uc2 Pure Storage\uc2 , went public Wednesday, falling 5% in its debut.\par \par \uc2 EMC\uc2  also owns software-development company Pivotal and network-security provider RSA. Its segments are run as separate businesses under a so-called federation structure that Elliott criticized. It isn't clear which, if any, might be included in a buyout of \uc2 EMC\uc2  by Dell.\par \par \uc2 A deal could amount to a win for Elliott, which has become one of the biggest activist investors focused on technology companies.

Square Wallet, the mobile app featured in the partnership, was shut down and \uc2 Howard Schultz\uc2 , Starbucks chief executive, resigned from the Square board after one year.\par \par \uc2 Square is a $6bn company on the verge of going public. The \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  partnership is largely forgotten, but it illustrates some of the company's key challenges - and the many questions that remain over its focus. Concerns are also mounting after \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 , the company's co-founder and chief executive, was appointed permanent chief executive of Twitter , his other start-up, on Monday.\par \par \uc2 For Square, having a part-time CEO has come at an inconvenient time. For two years it has been undergoing a difficult transition from being a consumer-facing payments app - the original dream behind the \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  partnership - to being an enterprise-facing company, whose fastest-growing services include providing capital to small businesses and selling subscriptions to business \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  software.\par \par \uc2 "Square kept playing around with consumer-facing products, but every single one of those products has been killed," says Zach Goldstein, founder of Thanx, a loyalty rewards company.\par \par \uc2 Payments processing still provides most of Square's revenue. Manhattan Venture Partners forecasts that the company will process $42bn in payments this year, generating $1.5bn in payments revenues - up 40 per cent from last year.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, when Square launched its first card reader, a white plastic device that connects to either an iPad or iPhone, it was one of the first such products that was available for small merchants, such as food trucks or farmers' market stalls.\par \par \uc2 But rising competition has put this business under threat, with rival payment processors from bigger companies such as Amazon and \uc2 PayPal\uc2  offering lower transaction fees.\par \par \uc2 There are also questions over how much longer merchants will rely on swiping credit cards, as mobile payments software such as Stripe and Braintree become more commonplace, and bricks-and-mortar stalls are replaced by online stores.\par \par \uc2 One of the bright spots for investors is Square Capital, which provides finance to small businesses in exchange for a fee repaid over time, similar to a loan.\par \par \uc2 The service, launched in May 2014, has handed out more than $225m, and is lending money at a rate of $1m a day. People close to the company say that Square Capital is highly profitable, adding that its rapid growth in recent months has helped propel Square towards profitability.\par \par \uc2 The return on these capital advances can be handsome: a $10,000 cash advance profiled on the Square Capital website generates a fee of 13 per cent. That is analogous to an annualised interest rate of more than 40 per cent, assuming the cash advance is repaid over four months. Yet Square is a relative late-comer to the boom in small business lending services: companies such as \uc2 PayPal\uc2 , \uc2 Lending Club\uc2 , \uc2 OnDeck\uc2  and Prosper all have fast-growing small business credit programmes as well.\par \par \uc2 Mr Dorsey issued a kind of manifesto for Square in a tweet on Monday. "Square stands for economic empowerment. We stand for financial systems that serve instead of rule. We stand for levelling the playing field."\par \par \uc2 However, the dramatic shifts the company has undergone in the past five years - from consumer-facing app to small business lender - suggest that there may be more pivots to come.\par \par \uc2 Square recently branched into food delivery, buying Caviar, and is expanding its enterprise software offerings. Some analysts worry about a lack of focus. "They have experimented with a lot of tangential business lines, and most of them haven't worked out that well," says Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.\par \par \uc2 Being chief executive will only become harder with an IPO, as the company's business model will be under even closer public scrutiny. Square filed confidentially for an IPO this year to test the waters, and may publicly reveal its prospectus in coming months.\par \par \uc2 Square has already raised nearly $600m from investors, but some venture capitalists believe it may be preparing to tap the public markets now because private interest has dried up. At a time when companies such as Uber, the ride-hailing app, are delaying IPOs because of plentiful private funding, Square is doing the opposite. "No one wants to pay a huge price any more from the private side for Square," says one venture capitalist, who is not an investor in Square. "This may have been the best way for them to get money."\par \par \uc2 Square's investors range from well-known venture capital firms such as Sequoia and \uc2 Kleiner Perkins\uc2  to institutional investors including GIC and Silicon Valley heavyweights such as Yahoo chief executive \uc2 Marissa Mayer\uc2 . Those willing to go on the record put a positive spin on Mr Dorsey splitting his time between \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and Square.\par \par \uc2 "I think this will raise the profile of Square and open up new partnership opportunities," says Essam Abadir, chief executive of Aspire Ventures. As a chief executive, "you don't have to be a full-time operator, you have to be a full-time visionary".\par \par \uc2 Square's investors can only hope that is enough.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Kadhim Shubber\par \par \uc2 Moments\par \par \uc2 Feature launches to help inexperienced users\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has launched Moments, a feature for finding news and entertainment on the messaging platform, in a product shake-up just a day after it appointed \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 , right, as permanent chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Moments, previously known as Project Lightning, is aimed at new or inexperienced \uc2 Twitter\uc2  users looking for specific streams of information, with tweets curated around news and events by a team of editors.\par \par \uc2 Madhu Muthukumar , product manager for Moments, described it as "the best of what's happening on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in an instant".\par \par \uc2 Moments is available to users in the US, and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is working to roll it out globally.\par \par \uc2 Hannah Kuchler\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020151007eba70002r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

U.S. revenue from the drug has more than doubled in that time, to $2 billion last year.\par \par \uc2 The key: repeated price increases. The multiple sclerosis drug's maker, \uc2 Biogen Inc\uc2 ., raised its price an average of 16% a year throughout the decade -- 21 times in all.\par \par \uc2 It is an example of drug companies' unusual ability to boost prices beyond the inflation rate to drive their revenue, even when demand for the drugs doesn't cooperate.\par \par \uc2 A result of this pricing power is that across 30 top-selling drugs sold by pharmacies, U.S. revenue growth has far outpaced demand in the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of corporate filings and industry data. Revenue growth averaged 61%, three times the increase in prescriptions.\par \par \uc2 Attention has focused lately on new drugs with eye-popping prices and on a few whose price a new owner abruptly raised several-fold. But what many drug companies rely on for sales growth is a pattern of steady increases, year in and year out, on older medicines. Wholesale-price increases for the 30 drugs analyzed by the Journal averaged 76% over the five-year stretch from 2010 through 2014. That was more than eight times general inflation.\par \par \uc2 For 20 leading global drug companies last year, 80% of growth in net profits stemmed from price increases in the U.S., according to a May report by \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Pricing power helps some in the pharmaceutical industry to compensate for sluggish demand, new competition or weak product pipelines. "Pricing has covered up a multitude of other disappointments over the past 15 years" in the sector, said Geoffrey Porges, a biotech analyst at \uc2 AllianceBernstein LP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This is no cause for cheer, of course, to certain other market participants, notably the many large companies that pick up the tab for their employees' prescriptions. Drug pricing has helped drive up spending on benefits at \uc2 Lowe's Cos\uc2 ., said \uc2 Bob Ihrie\uc2 , a senior vice president at the home-improvement retailer.\par \par \uc2 "It's one thing when you read about a new drug in the newspaper, and all the costs of launching it. But when it's drugs that have been on the market and you see these price increases, you go, 'Why would this be?'" Mr. Ihrie said. "I feel like we're really being taken advantage of."\par \par \uc2 Pharmaceutical companies defend their pricing as helping to finance development of innovative medicines, an expensive and risky enterprise they say wouldn't attract investment without the potential for large returns when a new drug succeeds.\par \par \uc2 Many in the industry also say a focus on drug prices is shortsighted because it overlooks drugs' role in helping to contain overall health-care costs by preventing disease complications.\par \par \uc2 Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for \uc2 Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\uc2 , a trade group, said that eventually, prices for all drugs will decline sharply when they lose patent protection and go generic.\par \par \uc2 Avonex maker \uc2 Biogen\uc2  has noted the central role of price boosts in the drug's success. "For 2014 compared to 2013, the increase in U.S. Avonex revenues was primarily due to price increases, partially offset by a decrease in unit sales volume of 10%," \uc2 Biogen\uc2  said in its 2014 financial report. A similar note has appeared in its annual reports since 2005.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Biogen\uc2  points to the way this revenue funds its quest for new medicines. The company spent an average of $1.19 billion annually on R&D from 2005 through 2014, or 24% of total revenue. Besides Avonex, the company has brought out two other multiple sclerosis drugs and is studying a treatment to repair nerve damage from the disease.\par \par \uc2 "Over the past two decades, which is the life of Avonex, we've done more than any other company to improve the treatment of multiple sclerosis," said Daniel McIntyre, a Biogen senior vice president. "The reality is that revenues from therapies available today make this possible."\par \par \uc2 What gives the pharmaceutical industry so much pricing power? Part of the reason is the patent protection drug makers have on new products, which keeps competitors from offering copies for up to two decades. "It's easier for consumers to substitute a car that meets their needs than it is to substitute a patented drug because no one else can make it," said Fiona M. Scott Morton, an economics professor at \uc2 Yale University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Another part of the answer is the insurance-based health system, in which consumers rarely feel the full brunt of price increases.\par \par \uc2 In most markets, products are ordered, paid for and consumed by the same party, notes Sara Fisher Ellison, a \uc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\uc2  economist. But prescription drugs are ordered by a physician, used by a patient and usually paid for by a third party, either an insurer or a large employer.\par \par \uc2 Neither doctors nor patients typically have much of a sense of drugs' prices. That blunts what economists call price sensitivity, the tendency of higher prices to curb demand.\par \par \uc2 "It confuses incentives and dampens the normal economic dynamics," Ms. Ellison said.\par \par \uc2 In addition, some drugs long on the market develop customer loyalty that provides a price umbrella. If patients who started on a drug such as Avonex a decade ago are happy with it, they or their doctors may see no reason to switch to a new one that comes along.\par \par \uc2 At an investment conference in 2009, \uc2 Biogen\uc2 's then-CEO \uc2 James Mullen\uc2  was asked whether the company could keep raising Avonex's price. He said he was surprised at "how unresistant the market has been to price increases." Mr. Mullen declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Until about a year ago, price increases were garnering little public attention because spending on drugs had moderated. U.S. expenditures for most prescription drugs grew by an average of 2.7% from 2007 through 2013, according to data from the \uc2 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\uc2 . That was a slower growth rate than in several previous years, due largely to greater use of generics as some big-selling drugs lost patent protection.\par \par \uc2 The moderating price effect from generics now is tapering off. Pharmacy-benefits manager \uc2 CVS Health Corp\uc2 . said drug spending by its customers jumped 12.7% last year, more than triple the prior year's rise.\par \par \uc2 Price boosts represented more than 80% of this increase, \uc2 CVS\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, Medicare's spending on its prescription-drug benefit rose 8% last year on a per capita basis, after several years of averaging less than 1%. A leading reason for the surge was "price increases for both brand-name and generic drugs," Medicare's board of trustees said in a recent report.\par \par \uc2 The Journal examined 30 of last year's top drugs by revenue that are sold by U.S. pharmacies, looking at data from the start of 2010 through the end of 2014. The analysis used corporate financial statements, prescription figures from \uc2 IMS Health Holdings Inc\uc2 . and wholesale-pricing data provided by \uc2 Truven Health \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It excluded drugs that weren't yet on the market in 2010 or for which full data weren't available.\par \par \uc2 For 18 of these 30 drugs, both revenue and the number of dispensed prescriptions for them rose. But revenue rose twice as fast as prescriptions.\par \par \uc2 For the cancer drug Gleevec, from \uc2 Novartis AG\uc2 , prescriptions rose 2% over the five years, but the wholesale price doubled, to $102,000 for a year's supply at the end of 2014. The price increases helped to drive \uc2 Novartis\uc2 's U.S. revenue from the drug up 69% over the period, to $2.17 billion in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Gleevec is a strikingly effective drug that has been approved for more cancers since its 2001 launch for chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML. Asked about the price increases on Gleevec, \uc2 Novartis\uc2  said it is "a life-changing medicine" whose "success is funding the next generation CML innovations."\par \par \uc2 Drug makers often give rebates from the wholesale prices -- also called list prices -- to large purchasers such as insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers. Even so, the wholesale prices are a meaningful measure because they are the starting point from which rebates are given.\par \par \uc2 In competitive markets such as asthma and diabetes therapy, which have multiple drugs that can be substituted for one another, manufacturers often give especially large rebates as they seek better positioning on insurers' "formularies" of covered drugs.\par \par \uc2 Take insulin, of which there are several brands, among them Humalog from \uc2 Eli Lilly & Co\uc2 . The company gave rebates averaging 56% of its list price last year, \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  estimates.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Eli Lilly said that although it doubled Humalog's price over five years, steep rebates meant that its net price rose only 3%.\par \par \uc2 With a drug that is harder to substitute for, such as \uc2 Amgen Inc\uc2 .'s arthritis treatment Enbrel, discounts are shallower. \uc2 Amgen\uc2  raised Enbrel's wholesale price 88% over the five years. The rebates it provided averaged 21% last year, \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  estimates.\par \par \uc2 Over the five years from 2010 through 2014, U.S. prescriptions for Enbrel rose 2% while \uc2 Amgen\uc2 's revenue from it went up by a third.\par \par \uc2 Some rebates are locked in. Medicaid and the \uc2 Veterans Health Administration\uc2  are legally entitled to rebates of at least 23.1% and 24%, respectively, on purchases of patent-protected drugs. Drug companies must also pay additional rebates to the two health programs if their drug prices exceed inflation.\par \par \uc2 Among the 30 retail drugs the Journal examined, 10 produced revenue increases for their makers last year despite lower demand. Prescriptions for these drugs declined an average of 17%. But their wholesale prices went up an average of 80%. After discounts, revenue from the drugs rose 22%.\par \par \uc2 For two drugs in the 30, both revenue and demand fell. But revenue fell less.\par \par \uc2 For a different category of drugs -- those usually administered in doctors' offices, such as intravenous cancer drugs -- prescription volumes aren't reliably tracked by commercial databases. To assess these, the Journal identified last year's 10 top-selling such drugs and analyzed 2010-13 data on how much Medicare reimbursed doctors for them. Medicare bases these reimbursements on the average price that drug makers report receiving from customers, excluding certain government buyers such as the \uc2 Veterans Health Administration\uc2  and Medicaid.\par \par \uc2 For four of the doctor-administered drugs, the number of billing claims from doctors fell, yet Medicare's outlays to doctors rose because prices went up.\par \par \uc2 For example, Medicare payments for Neulasta, an infection-fighting drug sold by \uc2 Amgen\uc2 , rose 12% over the four years, while claims from doctors who used it fell 8%.\par \par \uc2 The manufacturer reported that the average net price it received for this 13-year-old drug rose 24% over the four years, undergirding Medicare's higher payouts.\par \par \uc2 An Amgen spokeswoman said the company prices its products to "reflect the economic value that is delivered to patients, providers and payers."\par \par \uc2 Avonex, the drug with 21 price increases during a decade of falling demand, reached the U.S. market in 1996. It was just the second drug shown to delay symptoms of the most common form of multiple sclerosis.\par \par \uc2 The injected drug had been beaten to the market by one called Betaseron, now sold by \uc2 Bayer AG\uc2 . Both are genetically engineered versions of a protein called beta interferon. Avonex needed less-frequent injections and soon claimed half the market.\par \par \uc2 The maker of Avonex, \uc2 Biogen\uc2 , initially set its wholesale price at about $9,200 for a year of treatment. The strategy at that time focused on expanding the market, said a former Biogen vice president of sales, Michael Bonney. "We probably had pricing power, but we decided not to exercise it," he said.\par \par \uc2 As more MS drugs appeared, including some taken orally, (Avonex is injected), Avonex's share of the market steadily fell. Each year from 2005 through 2014, the company sold fewer units of Avonex, company financial statements show.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Biogen\uc2 's U.S. revenue from the drug kept growing as it raised the price up to three times a year. In the decade through 2014, the wholesale price, before discounts or rebates, more than quadrupled to an annual $62,000 per patient.\par \par \uc2 When former CEO Mr. Mullen was asked about the price increases at the 2009 investment conference, he said, according to a transcript: "If there's price increases that can be taken and delivered to shareholders, we'll go get it, but I do think we got to make sure we take a long enough view and you don't start to put this thing in a box, where you get the backlash."\par \par \uc2 Today, Avonex is among the least-popular MS drugs, said \uc2 Clyde Markowitz\uc2 , a specialist in the disease at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, but it is still used by patients who have had good results. While costs for all MS drugs have skyrocketed in the past decade, Dr. Markowitz said, Avonex's price growth has been extraordinary.\par \par \uc2 "It's absolute insanity, what's happened," he said. "For a drug that's 20 years old, and they just keep jacking up the price."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20151007000040"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020151007eba700013\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

Martin   \par \uc2 1,167 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 October 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)\par \uc2 WSJE\par B7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   \par \par \uc2 The state with the richest population may not have enough money in its own pockets.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut has roughly half of what it needs to pay future retirement benefits for its workers, meaning the home to scores of hedge funds and some of the country's wealthiest towns is wrestling with financial distress rivaling that of Kentucky or Illinois.\par \par \uc2 Some investors concerned about the size of Connecticut's pension hole are backing away from bonds issued by the Constitution State or demanding bigger rewards to hold them. Investors in some Connecticut state bonds now get a premium of about half a percentage point above benchmark bonds from other states, up from 0.28 percentage point a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data. Only four other U.S. states are now priced as riskier bets.\par \par \uc2 Still, some in the state say Connecticut's affluence is making it difficult to overcome complacency about fiscal problems. Yields on the state's debt would be even higher and budget problems would be worse if not for a deep pool of wealthy in-state investors willing to gobble up Connecticut's tax-deductible debt, according to analysts.\par \par \uc2 "There's almost limitless money to buy Connecticut bonds," said \uc2 Matt Fabian\uc2  of research firm Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Investors "are getting less of a risk premium than I think you deserve because of the high demand created by the wealth of the taxpayers in the state," added Paul Mansour, head of municipal research at Hartford, Conn.-based Conning.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut's surprising pension predicament shows how even the wealthiest parts of the U.S. are struggling to keep pace with ballooning retirement obligations that now amount to $1 trillion nationally.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut's unfunded pension liabilities more than doubled over the past decade to $26 billion as the state's retirement system reeled from inadequate state contributions, a subpar investment record and longer lifespans for its retirees.\par \par \uc2 The state, boosted by wealth concentrated in towns such as Greenwich and New Canaan, has a per capita income of $64,864, the highest in the U.S., according to a \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2  analysis of \uc2 Bureau of Economic Analysis\uc2  data. But the state still finished the fiscal year ended June 30 in the red as tax revenues fell below expectations and has projected annual deficits of $650 million or more after its current two-year budget cycle ends, according to a report by the state's Office of Fiscal Analysis.\par \par \uc2 The state's pension problems represent "a ticking time bomb," said State Sen. L. Scott Frantz, a Republican whose district includes the wealthiest section of the state. He is worried residents will leave and Connecticut will "end up as another Detroit," a city that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2013, absent more dramatic changes.\par \par \uc2 Some Connecticut officials and union leaders said they are unfazed by the pension problems and pledge to reverse the deficit in the coming decades. Their strategy hinges partly on predictions the various state retirement systems will be able to earn 8% or more annually, a goal that is more optimistic than most public pensions across the U.S. The average target for all state plans is 7.68%, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.\par \par \uc2 "The truth of the matter is that the state of Connecticut can afford to make up the difference over time," said Dan Livingston, a Hartford-based labor attorney who has negotiated on behalf of the state's public workers for decades.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut's pension gap developed as a result of decisions made over decades to scrimp on payments when the economy sputtered and to cut taxes, according to state leaders and public-finance experts. And there is a quirk: Connecticut officials contributed almost no money to the state's various public pensions from the late 1930s until the early 1980s, meaning little had been saved up because the state had chosen not to prefund the retirement system for future payouts.\par \par \uc2 The smaller base of assets hurt Connecticut during the 1990s when a run-up in the stock market pushed most pensions around the U.S. to fully funded status -- meaning they had more assets than liabilities, according to Gregory Mennis, director of Pew Charitable Trusts' public-sector retirement-systems project. Connecticut's ratio of assets to liabilities, meanwhile, was just 72% in 2001, according to Pew, which tracks pension-fund finances.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, Connecticut's annual investing returns have trailed the national average by a full percentage point since 2000, because of a heavy allocation to stocks that inflicted deep losses first during the dot-com bust and then the 2008 financial crisis. Connecticut pensions eventually shifted some bets to nontraditional investments, like hedge funds, but those produced lower returns as the equity markets rallied in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut only has 51.9% of the assets it needs to pay future obligations to workers, lower than all states except for Illinois and Kentucky, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut has scaled back pension benefits in recent years, reducing cost-of-living adjustments for retirees and pledging to make the appropriate annual payments to fully fund the system by 2032. State officials have raised taxes twice since 2011 as a way of covering some liabilities, reduced its workforce by more than 3% and held back on deeper spending on education and local aid.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut now allocates 10% of its budget to paying down unfunded pension obligations, up from about 7% four years ago, according to Connecticut Office of Policy and Management Secretary Ben Barnes, who oversees the budget.\par \par \uc2 "We have plenty of resources to address whatever shortfalls, or whatever fiscal crisis might develop in the short run," Mr. Barnes said.\par \par \uc2 But there are signs that the pressure on Connecticut could intensify absent deeper changes. \uc2 Standard & Poor's\uc2  Ratings Services lowered the outlook on Connecticut's bonds in March to negative from stable, meaning they could be downgraded from their current double-A rating. \uc2 Moody's Investors Service\uc2  already has placed Connecticut among the lowest-rated states. And \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2 , although it removed Connecticut's negative outlook in July, warned the state has a "narrow margin of flexibility."\par \par \uc2 States rarely default and generally carry higher ratings as a result. \uc2 Moody's\uc2 , which changed the way it calculates pension costs two years ago, has been more aggressive at downgrading states and cities with sizable unfunded obligations, while S&P and Fitch have generally taken a more optimistic view.\par \par \uc2 Fredrena deGraffenreaidt, a 61-year-old state retiree from East Hartford, is worried about whether future benefit cuts would force her to sell her house and move to a cheaper state, she said.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone sees us as this very wealthy state and yet our pension isn't 100% funded," Ms. deGraffenreaidt said. "How is that possible?"\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20151006000028"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020151006eba60000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

R&R said the chief executive of the combined business would be its CEO Ibrahim Najafi.\par \par \uc2 Switzerland-headquartered \uc2 Nestle\uc2  will contribute its ice-cream businesses in Europe, Egypt, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina to the new joint venture and transfer its European frozen-food businesses, excluding the pizza operation.\par \par \uc2 Nestle\uc2  holds roughly 10.8% of the global ice-cream market, while R&R has 0.8% according to research firm \uc2 Euromonitor\uc2 . The new joint venture would help \uc2 Nestle\uc2  better compete with archrival \uc2 Unilever PLC\uc2 , which has a 22.8% share of the global ice-cream market and which last week said it had agreed to buy Italian ice-cream maker Grom.\par \par \uc2 -- Saabira Chaudhuri\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 TELENOR\par \par \uc2 Company Divests\par \par \uc2 VimpelCom\uc2  Stake\par \par \uc2 Telenor ASA\uc2  of Norway said Monday it has decided to divest its one-third interest in \uc2 VimpelCom Ltd\uc2 ., the Amsterdam-based telecommunications operator facing accusations of corruption by U.S. and Dutch authorities.\par \par \uc2 Based on \uc2 VimpelCom\uc2 's closing price on Friday, \uc2 Telenor\uc2 's 33% stake is worth approximately 20 billion Norwegian kroner, or roughly $2.4 billion. That compares with \uc2 Telenor\uc2 's overall market value of 233 billion Norwegian kroner.\par \par \uc2 Telenor\uc2  said selling the asset could take some time, adding it expected to record a noncash impairment of 7.5 billion Norwegian kroner against its third-quarter earnings to reflect \uc2 Vimpelcom\uc2 's lower value in its books.\par \par \uc2 Shares in \uc2 VimpelCom\uc2 , one of Russia's largest telecom companies, have lost 67% of their value in the past two years.\par \par \uc2 -- Dominic Chopping and Jens Hansegard\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 HTC\par \par \uc2 Smartphones Maker\par \par \uc2 Posts Quarterly Loss\par \par \uc2 HTC Corp\uc2 . said Monday that it swung to a net loss for the third quarter as the company continued to struggle in the competitive smartphone market.\par \par \uc2 Taiwan-based HTC said its net loss totaled 4.48 billion Taiwan dollars (US$137 million) for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a net profit of NT$600 million a year earlier. The company's revenue dropped 49% to NT$21.4 billion from NT$41.9 billion in the same period last year.\par \par \uc2 The downbeat results came as no surprise as HTC has issued a profit warning and announced a series of restructuring efforts, including job cuts, in response to sluggish demand and weak sales in China.\par \par \uc2 Once the world's top smartphone maker by volume, HTC in 2013 fell out of the top 10 largest handset vendors by shipments.\par \par \uc2 -- Lorraine Luk\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 SUNCOR\par \par \uc2 Takeover Bid Made\par \par \uc2 For Oil-Sands Firm\par \par \uc2 Suncor Energy Inc\uc2 . on Monday said it launched an all-stock takeover offer valued at 4.3 billion Canadian dollars ($3.3 billion) for struggling oil-sands producer \uc2 Canadian Oil Sands Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Suncor, Canada's largest crude-oil producer, said its offer of 0.25 of a share for each Canadian Oil Sands share represents a 43% premium based on closing share prices on Friday. ,\par \par \uc2 Suncor, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, values its unsolicited offer at C$6.6 billion, including Canadian Oil Sands debt.\par \par \uc2 The offer for Canadian Oil Sands, which owns 37% of the Syncrude oil-sands mining consortium, comes as the oil producer struggles with a slumping stock price due partly to low crude prices.\par \par \uc2 Suncor recently said it was looking at selling some of its future production amid slumping oil prices and a expanding debt load.\par \par \uc2 For Suncor, the deal would give it a growing presence in the Canadian oil sands.\par \par \uc2 -- Judy McKinnon\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 APPLE\par \par \uc2 IPhone Maker Buys\par \par \uc2 Startup VocalIQ\par \par \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . has purchased an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  startup that could help make iPhone users' interactions with the virtual assistant Siri more natural.\par \par \uc2 Apple bought VocalIQ Ltd., a U.K.-based software maker working on ways to improve computers' ability to understand human speech, and to "speak" more naturally. The terms of the deal weren't disclosed.\par \par \uc2 An Apple spokesman confirmed the deal with the company's standard statement after an acquisition, saying Apple "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans."\par \par \uc2 VocalIQ didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 -- Jack Nicas\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 GOOGLE\par \par \uc2 Group Adds Funding\par \par \uc2 For Messaging Firm\par \par \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . has invested in a new round of funding for \uc2 Symphony Communication Services LLC\uc2  that values the Wall Street-backed messaging company at roughly $650 million, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2 's support adds a technology-industry stalwart to the list of banks and investment firms -- such as \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . -- that have backed Symphony and its fledgling communications software.\par \par \uc2 Symphony's latest funding round is expected to close this week, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Representatives for Google and Symphony declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Symphony was created as an alternative to \uc2 Bloomberg LP\uc2 's terminals, which have long been a hallmark of trading floors but are viewed as a significant cost center for financial firms.\par \par \uc2 -- Sarah Krouse\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 BOC\uc2  AVIATION\par \par \uc2 EVA Airways\uc2  Gets\par \par \uc2 Two \uc2 Airbus\uc2  Planes\par \par \uc2 BOC Aviation\uc2 , the aircraft-leasing arm of \uc2 Bank of China Ltd\uc2 ., has arranged a long-term lease of two \uc2 Airbus\uc2  A330-300 jets to \uc2 EVA Airways Corp\uc2 . of Taiwan.\par \par \uc2 The placement of the twin-aisle planes, in addition to two \uc2 Boeing Co\uc2 . 777-300ER jets already flying with \uc2 EVA Air\uc2 , reflect the continued growth and maturity of the Singapore-based firm's leasing business.\par \par \uc2 The smaller single-aisle jets such as the \uc2 Airbus\uc2  A320 or the \uc2 Boeing\uc2  737 are easier to place with airlines and preferred by leasing firms. \uc2 BOC Aviation\uc2  has a portfolio of 256 owned and managed aircraft operated by 61 airlines.\par \par \uc2 -- Gaurav Raghuvanshi\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20151006000016"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020151006eba60000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

At \uc2 Google\uc2 , Mr Spector - who has a PhD in computer science from \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  - worked on \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , speech recognition and translation. Before that he worked at \uc2 IBM\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Two Sigma was set up in 2001 by computer scientist \uc2 David Siegel\uc2  and statistician \uc2 John Overdeck\uc2 . Both have a background from DE Shaw, another large "quant" hedge fund, and harness the immense strides in computing power, data management and complex algorithms to mine global markets for lucrative investment opportunities.\par \par \uc2 "Alfred's unique skills and experience in the areas of engineering, research, and strategy are ideally suited to our company at this stage in our development," said \uc2 David Siegel\uc2 , co-chairman of Two Sigma. "We are confident that he will help us continue to innovate for the benefit of our investors."\par \par \uc2 A number of high-profile Wall Street luminaries have jumped ship for the West Coast tech industry in recent years, such as \uc2 Ruth Porat\uc2  , who left her position as chief financial officer at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  for the same position at \uc2 Google\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the hedge fund world can still offer compensation packages that are competitive with even the biggest Silicon Valley giants, and a similarly intellectual challenge.\par \par \uc2 "Technology has had exceptional and growing impact in nearly every sector over the last 20 years. When it comes to investment management, Two Sigma has an unmatched ability to apply technology for beneficial innovation," Mr Spector said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 "I am excited to work with such a talented team of professionals to help advance the use of technology to discover value in the world's data and much more."\par \par \uc2 So-called "systematic" investment managers and strategies have been one of the hotter areas in the hedge fund industry in recent years, but some analysts are concerned that their tendency to often target a specific level of market volatility as a risk management tool could ironically be aggravating market movements.\par \par \uc2 On its website Two Sigma describes its investment approach as scientific, and said "risk is a living thing in our business, and we watch over it carefully".\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020151002eba20002h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A change that is putting new credit cards in many Americans' wallets will also shift billions of dollars of card-fraud liability to retailers from big banks.\par \par \uc2 Merchants are scrambling to deal Thursday with the end of a longtime policy in which financial institutions absorbed the cost of certain fraudulent credit-and-debit card transactions.\par \par \uc2 Starting that day, the merchants will have to foot the bill for the transactions if they haven't upgraded their payment terminals to accept new, more secure cards.\par \par \uc2 For millions of U.S. consumers, the new cards being rolled out are replacing the familiar action of swiping a card with dipping it at the cash register. After the change, consumers in most cases will still not be liable for fraudulent transactions on their cards.\par \par \uc2 Behind the scenes, though, the risks of card fraud are shifting. Under timetables announced by card networks \uc2 Visa Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 MasterCard Inc\uc2 ., most card issuers starting Thursday are expected to immediately start passing certain fraudulent transaction costs onto retailers that don't have the capability to process the chip-based cards, industry executives said.\par \par \uc2 The move from the old cards with the magnetic stripe on the back to the new ones with an embedded computer chip is aimed at reducing fraud with counterfeit cards. Historically, card issuers such as banks and credit unions covered those costs.\par \par \uc2 The new chip cards, which have been flooding consumer mailboxes for months, provide a unique code for each transaction, compared with static data that are contained on the traditional magnetic strip.\par \par \uc2 While the chip itself won't stop thieves from hacking a merchant's payment system, any stolen card information will be virtually useless since the data change each time it is used.\par \par \uc2 Some of the nation's largest merchants have already switched on the upgraded terminals, which should shield them from the new liability. \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Home Depot Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Target Corp\uc2 . are among the big retailers that have already been processing chip-card transactions. \uc2 Best Buy Co\uc2 . says it will have chip-card readers in more than 1,400 stores by Thursday, while \uc2 Lowe's Cos\uc2 . says it expects to have chip-card capabilities in more than 90% of its nearly 1,800 stores by the end of October.\par \par \uc2 Many smaller merchants won't have the technology ready in time. Only about 19% of merchants will have the equipment to accept the chip cards by the end of the year, according to Mercator Advisory Group, a consulting firm.\par \par \uc2 Companies that process payments for merchants are adding staff and training workers to deal with retailers that may be surprised to find themselves on the hook.\par \par \uc2 Robert Carr\uc2 , chief executive officer of Heartland Payment Systems Inc., a Princeton. N.J., company that processes debit-and credit-card transactions for merchants, estimates that about 150,000 of his 180,000 customers, aren't ready to accept chip cards.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSmall merchants are going to be shocked and I think they're going to be mad as hell," said Mark Horwedel, chief executive of the Merchant Advisory Group, an organization of retailers.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, issuers have sent out more than 200 million of the new chip cards, which also contain the magnetic strip so they can still be used at merchants that haven't upgraded their equipment. Merchants aren't officially required to install the technology to accept the new cards, but they risk incurring more costs if they don't.\par \par \uc2 Counterfeit cards represented $3 billion of the estimated $3.8 billion in fraud losses attributed to brick-and-mortar store transactions last year, according to Aite Group, a Boston-based consulting firm.\par \par \uc2 The new chip cards have a visible computer chip embedded on the front. Consumers must dip them into a slot at the bottom of the checkout terminal and leave them there throughout the transaction rather than making a quick swipe in the traditional method.\par \par \uc2 Other countries around the world have experienced significant declines in counterfeit fraud since their governments required the adoption of new chip cards and terminals.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S., the decision to upgrade to the new cards is made by card issuers such as \uc2 American Express Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Capital One Financial Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The merchant decides whether to upgrade the payment terminal, while card networks such as \uc2 Visa\uc2  and \uc2 MasterCard\uc2  set the rules for liability.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Retail Industry Leaders Association\uc2 , a trade group that represents merchants, estimates retailers are spending more than $8 billion to upgrade payment systems to accept the new cards. It says \u8220\'20\'1Cmost large retailers will have the new terminals running this fall."\par \par \uc2 Small and-midsize merchants may be particularly vulnerable because they have been slower to adopt the new technology. Restaurants, grocery stores and liquor stores are also among the most popular places where cardholder data are stolen, according to Rippleshot, a fraud-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm in Chicago.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe're increasing our resources in anticipation of a potential spike" in the number of fraudulent charges that will be charged back to the merchant, said Deanna Karhuniemi, vice president of chip-card strategy at Chase Commerce Solutions, a \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase\uc2  unit that processes payments for merchants.\par \par \uc2 Despite the new rules, card issuers will continue to bear the cost of fraud stemming from counterfeit cards that contain data stolen from nonchip cards.\par \par \uc2 A recent report from Mercator estimates that 58% of credit cards will be chip-enabled by the end of 2015. Banks are also now issuing chips on debit cards as well.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Huang contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Robin Sidel at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Robin Sidel@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Robin Sidel@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150929eb9t009c5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

He moved in for the win as Cushman closed its $2 billion merger with DTZ this month. The group includes about 30 brokers.\par \par \uc2 "He was relentless," said Mr. Griffin. But he added: "He gave me time to think of it."\par \par \uc2 Poaching the Griffin team was a major -- but not inexpensive -- coup for Newmark, which has been on a growth tear since 2011, when it was acquired by \uc2 BGC Partners Inc\uc2 ., a spinoff of \uc2 Cantor Fitzgerald\uc2 . Boston is a big prize: It was the second-largest U.S. sales market for commercial property in the 12 months that ended in June, with $9.84 billion in deals, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The deal also is a major step in the efforts by Mr. Gosin and Newmark President \uc2 James Kuhn\uc2  in building the firm's sales business, an important piece of its strategy to build a firm with the global clout of industry leaders \uc2 CBRE Group Inc\uc2 . and JLL. It comes a few months after Newmark purchased Apartment Realty Advisors, one of the largest brokers of U.S. apartment buildings, for $110 million.\par \par \uc2 This year, Newmark will broker sales of about $20 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Next year it could do $30 billion to $35 billion, these people said.\par \par \uc2 "We hope that Rob will do for the commercial market what ARA did for us in residential," Mr. Kuhn said in an interview Saturday.\par \par \uc2 But losing the Griffin team was an out-of-the-gate setback for Cushman and its chief executive, industry veteran \uc2 Brett White\uc2 , who also is pushing hard to make the firm an upper-echelon player like JLL and CBRE. Cushman's brokerage operation in Boston has been badly hurt, although the office remains strong in appraisal and building management.\par \par \uc2 The departures were a textbook example of one of the big risks of mergers in the real-estate-services business: Top producers can walk out the door.\par \par \uc2 Newmark's success at luring the Griffin team also underscores the intensity of the competition these days for talent in the hot brokerage business, which is being fueled by rising deal activity. Mr. Griffin also talked to other firms about a possible move, and the signing bonus being discussed for his group exceeded $20 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. White, of Cushman, has promised to be a fierce competitor in the industry scrum over talent. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal this month -- before news of Newmark's Boston Tea Party broke -- he pointed to the financial muscle of the investment group led by private-equity firm TPG.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think anyone can doubt that our ownership is eager to deploy capital," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. White predicted that Cushman would generate enough money from cash flow to finance growth, so it wouldn't need to take on more debt or more equity from its owners. He declined to specify how much cash flow the firm had available, but experts estimate that next year Cushman could generate about $200 million.\par \par \uc2 Newmark's parent, BGC, also has a sizable war chest. This year, BGC said it was planning to sell its \uc2 Trayport\uc2  business, which designs commodity-trading systems, in a deal expected to boost its available capital.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Peter Grant contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150928000067"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150928eb9s0001l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Meanwhile, treasurers have reduced their companies' holdings of more traditional investments such as U.S. Treasurys, commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit.\par \par \uc2 Companies are betting highly rated corporate bonds are safe repositories for cash that will pay higher rates than more traditional bank deposits or money-market funds. But they are also increasing the risk to an asset where principal protection is the priority.\par \par \uc2 If interest rates rise quickly, the value of their lower-yielding existing bonds could plummet. A major market disruption could also make it difficult for companies to sell their holdings if they need the cash. Either could lead to write-downs or actual losses if they sell at lower prices than they paid.\par \par \uc2 For now, treasurers are figuring the bet isn't that risky. Companies' balance sheets are in good shape, and buyers are focusing on bonds that mature within five years, which carry lower risks than bonds that take longer to mature.\par \par \uc2 Still, the past offers plenty of examples of companies that got burned when reaching for yield. \uc2 Procter & Gamble Co\uc2 . lost more than $100 million after it bought derivatives from \uc2 Bankers Trust Co\uc2 . in 1993 in an unsuccessful bet that interest rates would remain low. \uc2 MetroPCS Communications Inc\uc2 . wrote down millions in investments in 2007 because it invested in auction-rate securities and couldn't sell the holdings. Even mainstream investments can have hiccups in tough times. After \uc2 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc\uc2 .'s 2008 collapse during the financial panic, \uc2 Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co\uc2 . was forced to borrow $600 million from its credit lines because it couldn't access cash trapped in locked money-market funds.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTo get more return, you have to take more credit risk," said a treasurer at a large technology company that has actively been buying corporate bonds.\par \par \uc2 Aggressive buying by their peers is one factor that has spurred U.S. companies to issue enormous quantities of debt. As of Sept. 24, issuance of investment-grade corporate debt including financial borrowers hit $1 trillion in 2015, on pace for a record year, according to data tracker Dealogic.\par \par \uc2 One frustration for treasurers is short-term interest rates that have remained near zero since late 2008. Adding to that is a bevy of regulations that have made it more difficult for them to park money in bank accounts or money funds.\par \par \uc2 New banking rules by the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  have made it more expensive for banks to hold large corporate deposits. As a result, they are discouraging companies from socking too much money away in their accounts.\par \par \uc2 New Securities and Exchange Commission rules could make money-market funds less attractive by forcing them to abandon their $1 share price and allow them to impose fees on shareholders for withdrawing assets or suspend redemptions temporarily to thwart panic selling.\par \par \uc2 That makes treasurers' less confident that they will get all their money back, and have access to their money, in a crisis. The rules won't take effect for another year, but treasurers are already turning elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere's really no other game in town," said \uc2 Ben Campbell\uc2 , chief executive officer of Capital Advisors Group Inc., which advises companies on their cash- management strategies.\par \par \uc2 The biggest corporate investors in bonds come from the technology and pharmaceuticals sectors, where companies have cash to spare. iPhone maker Apple, for one, held almost $100 billion worth of corporate bonds at the end of June. That was a 25% increase from the end of its 2014 fiscal year, representing almost half the cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. The total is also almost equal to the value of bonds issued in June this year.\par \par \uc2 Oracle\uc2 , the business-software maker, held $28.9 billion in corporate debt at the end of May, 73% more than a year ago. The bonds made up 53% of the company's cash and equivalent assets.\par \par \uc2 Pharmaceutical giant \uc2 Johnson & Johnson\uc2  held $3.5 billion of corporate bonds at the end of June, roughly 10% of its liquid, financial assets, and a 162% increase from the end of 2014. Rival Amgen Inc. held $15.9 billion in bonds at end of June, up 22% from December.\par \par \uc2 Many of those companies also have much of their cash in Europe, where rates are even lower than in the U.S. With few places to put it, and unable to bring the funds home without paying U.S. taxes, the corporations are investing in the bond market, said one banker who has sold bonds to companies.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey've gone from an infrequently seen but nice-to-have participant to a very commonly seen participant," the banker said.\par \par \uc2 Borrowers say companies are playing big roles in some large transactions. When \uc2 Verizon\uc2  issued the largest bond on record two years ago to fund the takeover of \uc2 Vodafone Group PLC\uc2 's share of their U.S. wireless joint venture, many \u8220\'20\'1Clarge companies" helped take down the $49 billion in securities, said \uc2 Fran Shammo\uc2 , the company's finance chief. He declined to name them.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, corporations were among the bidders for $10 billion in bonds issued by pharmaceutical giant Gilead, a person familiar with the transaction said.\par \par \uc2 The corporate buyers have started to make their presence felt in the market. As their appetite for bonds has increased, prices for securities with shorter maturities have risen, said John Majoros, a managing director at Wasmer, Schroeder & Co., which manages $5.5 billion in assets.\par \par \uc2 He said his firm has been buying bonds with longer maturities to get around that competition and hopefully find better bargains.\par \par \uc2 Home-improvement retailer \uc2 Lowe's Cos\uc2 . was able to sell $250 million of bonds maturing in 2018 at full price earlier this month because of high demand. Conversely, it offered debt maturing in 10 and 30 years at a discount to entice investors. Investors ask for discounts on securities to boost their yields.\par \par \uc2 The bond buying is causing companies to act like mutual funds or brokers, investing cash on behalf of their shareholders, argued Victoria Ivashina, a finance professor at \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a risky business," she said. \u8220\'20\'1CCan they get it wrong? Absolutely they can get it wrong."\par \par \uc2 Write to Vipal Monga at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:vipal.monga@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 vipal.monga@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150925eb9p000b8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

You\u8217\'20\'19re paying for the right to waste electricity servicing the bitcoin network in return for a bitcoin shaving that earns you some sort of \u8216\'20\'18node\u8217\'20\'19* stake in the system.\par \par \uc2 Vitalik Buterin {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3lvo37/so21dropped_their_first_product_today_smart/cv9yp0w"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 at Ethereum }}}\uc2  has crunched the numbers and he points out:\par \par \uc2 So you\u8217\'20\'19re paying $399 upfront and getting $0.105 per day or $38.3 per year, and this is before taking into account network difficulty increases, the upcoming block halving (yay, your profit goes down to $0.03 per day!) and, of course, the near-100% likelihood that you won\u8217\'20\'19t be able to keep that device on absolutely all of the time. I seriously hope they have multiple mining chips inside of their device and forgot to mention it; otherwise you can outcompete this offering pretty easily by just preloading a raspberry pi with $200 of your favorite cryptotokens.\par \par \uc2 You can read more about how the 21 device is fundamentally loss making on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://21.co/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 21.co }}}\uc2  (yes, a Colombian domain). There you will also find useful information about how the value of bitcoin isn\u8217\'20\'19t really underpinned by shameless rent seeking but \u8212\'20\'14 who\u8217\'20\'19d have thought \u8212\'20\'14 productivity and output. Usefully, 21.co also offer the community {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://21.co/faq/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 these pearls of wisdom }}}\uc2  about how economics work:\par \par \uc2 For those now thinking Larry Summers + Miners + Pointless Wasted Energy + Productivity illusion must equal = THE BIGGEST KEYNESIAN COALMINE EXPERIMENT OF ALL TIME\u8230\'20\'26 Who knows. Maybe. It\u8217\'20\'19s certainly more convenient than staging {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://business.time.com/2011/08/16/paul-krugman-an-alien-invasion-could-fix-the-economy/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a faux alien invasion.  }}}\par \par \uc2 But there are surely better and fairer ways to distribute a fixed amount of wealth to the wider population? Also, can a Bitcoin Raspberry Pi actually fix Kennedy airport the way Summers would like? We\u8217\'20\'19re not so sure.\par \par \uc2 But of course the \u8220\'20\'1Ccomputer\u8221\'20\'1D is not supposed to be a Bitcoin miner, instead it\u8217\'20\'19s what the industry likes to call a devkit, which suggests it\u8217\'20\'19s really a means towards an endlessly stimulative \u8220\'20\'1Cdigging up apps\u8221\'20\'1D-economy. And who knows maybe one day someone will develop an app that helps the world bypass Kennedy airport altogether or better still gets planes to mine bitcoins as they fly so that cryptocurrency can rain down into a giant \u8220\'20\'1CFix Kennedy Airport\u8221\'20\'1D escrow account. There are so many possibilities.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, 21 Inc expects its node-based micro-transaction-accepting developer army might even disrupt the business models of \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  by uprooting the advertising-based digital model altogether.\par \par \uc2 You see, in 21 Inc\u8217\'20\'19s mind it\u8217\'20\'19s not a lack of wealth or real world resources that discourages people from paying for digital stuff on the internet. It\u8217\'20\'19s peoples\u8217\'20\'19 distrust of sharing information on the web combined with the friction of logging into a \uc2 PayPal\uc2  account.\par \par \uc2 Instead, with 21 everyone has the opportunity to earn an unsoiled bitcoin ration which can be spent any way they please, protecting their identity throughout the transaction process. The fact that this immediately turns the digital economy into a rationing system whilst also bifurcating the market between fresh bitcoins and second-hand bitcoins (undermining one of the core features of money, which is that it\u8217\'20\'19s supposed to be fungible) is apparently besides the point.\par \par \uc2 What\u8217\'20\'19s also lost on 21 Inc is that it\u8217\'20\'19s not really the ability to take micropayments that\u8217\'20\'19s the problem for the digital economy. It\u8217\'20\'19s the fact that people aren\u8217\'20\'19t prepared to pay more than a dollar shaving for a digital good, because in their list of priorities tangible goods are still more important than digital goods\u8211\'20\'13 and they\u8217\'20\'19re not prepared to substitute one for the other.\par \par \uc2 As regards privacy and information sharing, the following from 21 Inc\u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://21.co/terms/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 terms and conditions }}}\uc2  is worth a read:\par \par \uc2 What Information is Collected\par \par \uc2 When you use our Services, we may collect information you send us or information we receive from your use of our Services.

In this retelling of the narrative, however, 21 grammes is the weight of your digital data, $0.03 is the value the digital economy wishes you to get per day and the true breadth and scope of the contract you sign {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.linkedin.com/in/balajissrinivasan"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  with Balaji Srinivasan }}}\uc2 , 21 Inc\u8217\'20\'19s CEO, is revealed in the terms and conditions outlined above, and is definitely worth more than $399.99 to 21.\par \par \uc2 This thing is listed as the No 1 Amazon best seller in the server category.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 S\u195\'00\'C3O PAULO\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Brazil's central bank\uc2  intervened to try to calm the country's volatile foreign-exchange market and prop up the Brazilian currency, the real, which has been sliding{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-real-hits-two-decade-low-1442962341"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 against the dollar}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The bank announced in the early afternoon auctions of currency-swap contracts, which offer businesses a hedge against the weaker real, and auctions of dollar-repurchase agreements, which temporarily inject dollars into the market. Later Wednesday afternoon, the bank announced two more repurchase auctions.\par \par \uc2 The real fell from 4.0150 to the dollar Wednesday morning to 4.1430 in the early afternoon, according to Tullett Prebon via FactSet. The real exited active trading at 4.1325 to the dollar, after closing at 4.0450 on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The bank has used auctions of both instruments before to help support the real. In 2013, the central bank started a program of regular auctions of dollar-swap agreements. The bank stopped auctioning off new swap agreements earlier this year, but has been rolling over existing contracts. The central bank also has auctioned off dollar-repurchase agreements on three occasions in recent weeks.\par \par \uc2 The central bank use of repurchase and swap auctions provided a brief boost for the real, but it would need to sell reais directly into the market to have a longer-lasting impact, said Luiz Carlos Baldan, a director of the Fourtrade brokerage in S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo.\par \par \uc2 The bank's actions came after Brazil's Congress handed a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-congress-upholds-most-of-rousseffs-vetoes-on-extra-spending-1443006711"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rare victory to President Dilma Rousseff}}}\uc2  earlier in the day, sustaining presidential vetoes of spending bills that would have worsened the nation's fiscal problems at a time when the government is struggling to close a massive budget hole.\par \par \uc2 In a tense legislative session that started Tuesday night and continued into the wee hours of the morning, legislators voted to allow the president to kill expensive spending bills.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers permitted 26 of Ms. Rousseff's 32 vetoes on bills that together would have added an estimated 127 billion reais ($31.5 billion) to government outlays.\par \par \uc2 The bills vetoed included ones granting hefty salary increases to government workers and tax breaks on fuel, among other things.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt was a victory for the government accounts. If the vetoes were overturned, it would represent a big cost for this administration and future ones," said Cristiano Oliveira, chief economist at \uc2 Banco Fibra\uc2  in S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo.\par \par \uc2 Still, investors remain jittery about prospects for Latin America's largest economy. The real fell from 4.0150 to the dollar Wednesday morning to 4.1430 in the early afternoon, according to Tullett Prebon via FactSet. The real exited active trading at 4.1325 to the dollar, after closing at 4.0450 on Tuesday. The currency has slumped sharply in recent days, going from 3.9480 against the dollar at the close on Friday, to Wednesday's record lows against the U.S. currency. The real was launched in 1994, replacing the previous currency as part of a plan to tame the country's out-of-control inflation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey didn't do anything they haven't done before, that's why the dollar went back up again" shortly after the announcement, he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe bank should come in and sell dollars for real. If I sell my car, I don't ask for it back after just a few weeks, what's the point?"\par \par \uc2 The Brazilian currency has lost about 70% of its value against the dollar in the past 12 months as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-sinks-into-recession-on-second-quarter-output-contraction-1440765489"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the country's economy has struggled}}}\uc2  and a corruption scandal at state-controlled oil company \uc2 Petr\u243\'00\'F3leo Brasileiro SA{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazilian-police-seek-to-question-former-president-in-petrobras-probe-1442008371"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 spread to implicate dozens of prominent politicians}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Rousseff, who hasn't been implicated in the scandal, has nevertheless seen her approval ratings plummet to less than 10%. Her efforts to shrink the government's budget deficit, and protect Brazil's investment-grade credit rating, have been complicated by her unpopularity, which has made it difficult to get her economic austerity program approved by Congress.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe increasing financial sensitivity seems to be driven by the economy's political obstacles," said Alfredo Couti\u241\'00\'F1o, director for Latin America at \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Ms. Rousseff \u8220\'20\'1Cis facing strong resistance in Congress, and the risk of a political crisis is increasing."\par \par \uc2 Standard & Poor's\uc2  downgraded Brazil's rating to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/s-p-drops-brazil-debt-rating-one-notch-to-junk-1441838102"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 junk status}}}\uc2  earlier this year, and analysts and traders expect other ratings companies to follow suit in coming days or weeks. Fitch and \uc2 Moody's\uc2  still give Brazil investment-grade ratings.\par \par \uc2 While Wednesday's legislative action kept Brazil from digging itself an even deeper fiscal hole, Congress delayed decisions on a half-dozen other measures vetoed by Ms. Rousseff, including a bill that would increase some judiciary salaries by as much as 70%. The remaining bills would generate 47 billion reais ($11.5 billion) in additional spending through 2019, according to government estimates.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers so far have shown little willingness to cooperate with Ms. Rousseff to pass deep program cuts and large tax increases needed to shore up Brazil's shaky finances.\par \par \uc2 Rogerio Jelmayer contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jeffrey T.

The vote was a setback for pension funds and other activist investors that have pushed to separate the roles at several companies, including \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 , the second-largest U.S. bank by assets.\par \par \uc2 "We're happy with the results" of the vote, Mr. Moynihan said after the meeting, which was attended by a crowd of fewer than 100 people. Asked about the decisions made by the bank that led to the vote, Mr. Moynihan replied: "You don't look back."\par \par \uc2 The bank now has to tackle other challenges. Its share price has fallen about 9% over the past 12 months, a sharper decline than at other large U.S. banks. The lender also needs to resubmit its "stress test" to the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  by next week, after the central bank told \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  in the spring that it needs to correct weaknesses in its capital planning. The resilience test helps determine what the bank can pay in dividends.\par \par \uc2 Still, Tuesday's tally provided a surprisingly decisive margin, considering that the two largest U.S. pensions lobbied investors to vote against BofA's recommendation. Some bank officials had told people recently that the vote could go either way.\par \par \uc2 Shareholders who voted with the bank pointed to outreach from executives and \uc2 Jack Bovender\uc2 , the board's lead independent director, that suggested \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  was taking seriously their concerns about the board's decision to combine the CEO and chairman roles despite a 2009 bylaw that divided them.\par \par \uc2 State Street\uc2  Global Advisors, the bank's second-largest shareholder, according to FactSet, originally had concerns about the 2014 move to make Mr. Moynihan chairman without prior shareholder input. But officials at the money-management unit of \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 . said the bank's board was responsive to their concerns in part through the work of Mr. Bovender.\par \par \uc2 "We recognize that leadership could be provided by an independent chair or a strong lead independent director," said Rakhi Kumar, \uc2 State Street\uc2  Global Advisors' head of corporate governance. The fund manager decided to vote for the bank proposal.\par \par \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 's results were roughly in line with those of \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., where in 2012 40% of shareholders voted to split the chairman and CEO roles under \uc2 James Dimon\uc2  amid concern over the "London whale" trading loss. However, the 37% of shareholders supporting a split in the roles at \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  exceeded the percentage at \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  that supported a split in 2013, when big U.S. pension funds mounted a campaign similar to the one they did this year at \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After the vote Tuesday, bank officials pledged that the board would meet more regularly with the biggest shareholders, though the bank gave no indication that investors should expect changes to the board, despite a push from some shareholders.\par \par \uc2 "This is as strong a board as I've ever seen or ever been engaged in," said Mr. Bovender, former chairman and CEO of hospital chain \uc2 HCA Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some shareholders said after the vote that they will continue to lobby for changes to the board.\par \par \uc2 We "do expect the board to adopt a more active oversight role," said \uc2 Ricardo Duran\uc2 , a spokesman for the \uc2 California State Teachers' Retirement System\uc2 . "We'd like to see better stock performance."\par \par \uc2 "I hope they don't just put blindfolds on," said Buzzy Geduld, CEO of the hedge fund Cougar Capital, which voted its 2.5 million shares against the bank.\par \par \uc2 Proposals to split the CEO and chairman roles this year have gained an average of about 30% support at big U.S. companies, according to \uc2 ISS\uc2  Voting \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150923000106"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150923eb9n0002r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Two big owners of single-family rental homes said Monday they have agreed to merge, a bet that rents will keep rising and homes will remain difficult for many Americans to buy.\par \par \uc2 Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust\uc2 , a publicly traded real-estate investment trust run by \uc2 Barry Sternlicht\uc2 , the longtime real-estate investor who is \uc2 Starwood Capital Group\uc2 's chief executive, will combine with closely held \uc2 Colony American Homes Inc\uc2 . in a deal that values Colony at about $1.5 billion based on Starwood Waypoint's closing share price Friday. The Wall Street Journal had reported the deal earlier Monday, citing people familiar with the talks.\par \par \uc2 Under the terms of the agreement, Colony shareholders will receive about 65 million shares of Starwood Waypoint. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Starwood Waypoint shares were inactive premarket.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe believe this merger demonstrates the power of scale and consolidation and really crystallizes the long-term durability of the single-family rental industry," said \uc2 Thomas J. Barrack Jr\uc2 ., the executive chairman of Colony American Homes' parent, Colony Capital. He will serve as nonexecutive co-chairman of the combined company alongside Mr. Sternlicht.\par \par \uc2 The two companies own a combined total of more than 30,000 homes valued at nearly $8 billion. Messrs. Sternlicht and Barrack were part of the rush by big investors to buy foreclosed homes in bulk, often sight unseen and at steep discounts, after the U.S. housing market collapsed.\par \par \uc2 Such investors concentrated their buying in some of the hardest-hit areas, including southern Florida, Phoenix, Atlanta and California, hoping to gain enough size in each market to make management of the properties more efficient.\par \par \uc2 Other major buyers of single-family rental homes include \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2 , which has spent nearly $10 billion to acquire and spruce up about 50,000 foreclosed homes now rented through its Invitation Homes LP.\par \par \uc2 The proposed merger of Starwood Waypoint and Colony is a bet that the percentage of Americans who own homes will remain unusually low. While the foreclosure crisis has receded, toughened lending standards have pushed millions of Americans out of the homebuying market.\par \par \uc2 Higher interest rates would increase borrowing costs and make it harder for some renters to buy homes.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  decided last week not to raise short-term interest rates from near zero, where they have held since 2008, but the central bank is expected to revisit the matter later this year.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. homeownership rate is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, falling to 63.5% in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, single-family rentals now add up to 13% of overall housing stock, up from 9% in 2005, according to a report by \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rents have been climbing steadily, though some analysts and investors question how long it can last, especially in areas with weak wage growth. Many of the rental homes scooped up by big investors are in those parts of the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The single-family rental home business was long dominated by mom-and-pop operators. Big investors have used their access to capital and number-crunching skill to barrel into the market. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/racing-to-buy-homes-sight-unseen-1428940421"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Starwood Waypoint touts algorithms}}}\uc2  it has developed to guide decisions that include which neighborhoods to target.\par \par \uc2 The response from stock-market investors has been mostly tepid so far.\par \par \uc2 As of Friday, Starwood Waypoint shares were down about 20% since its spinoff from \uc2 Starwood Property Trust\uc2  last year. Shares of \uc2 American Homes 4 Rent\uc2 , which owned 37,491 homes in 22 states as of June 30, have risen 2.7% since their stock-market debut in August 2013.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  executives have said they plan to eventually list shares of Invitation Homes through an initial public offering.\par \par \uc2 Bond buyers have been more enthusiastic, snapping up the debt issued by some companies in the sector.\par \par \uc2 In the two years since \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 's Invitation Homes sold the first bond backed by rents from a pool of houses, $13 billion of such bonds have been sold, according to \uc2 Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Single-family rental companies must convince investors that the single-family rental model will remain viable if homeownership levels rebound. Some outsiders also question how much more firms like \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 , Colony and Starwood Waypoint can grow now that so many of the most deeply discounted foreclosed homes have been purchased.\par \par \uc2 Single-family rental companies also face questions about their ability to maintain tens of thousands of scattered properties. The chores include cutting lawns, fixing sinks, insurance and keeping track of rental rates and payments.\par \par \uc2 Big investors need to amass enough market share to keep their operating costs in check.\par \par \uc2 In June, Starwood Waypoint said the company and other institutional investors owned roughly 200,000 of the 15.3 million U.S. rental homes, suggesting significant room for expansion if other conditions are ripe.\par \par \uc2 The two companies believe that a merger would result in as much as $50 million in cost reductions.\par \par \uc2 If the deal goes through, Colony investors would own 59% of the combined company's shares, while Starwood Waypoint shareholders would own 41%. Starwood Waypoint would issue new shares as part of the merger.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ryan Dezember at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ryan.dezember@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ryan.dezember@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Chelsey Dulaney contributed to this article\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150921eb9l001gv\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Barring a last-minute snarl, the merger could be announced as soon as Monday, these people said.\par \par \uc2 The two companies own a combined total of more than 31,000 homes valued at nearly $8 billion. Messrs. Sternlicht and his counterpart at Colony, \uc2 Thomas Barrack Jr\uc2 ., were part of the rush by big investors to buy foreclosed homes in bulk, often sight unseen and at steep discounts, after the U.S. housing market collapsed.\par \par \uc2 Such investors concentrated their buying in some of the hardest-hit areas, including southern Florida, Phoenix, Atlanta and California, hoping to gain enough size in each market to make management of the properties more efficient.\par \par \uc2 Other major buyers of single-family rental homes include \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2 , which has spent nearly $10 billion to acquire and spruce up about 50,000 foreclosed homes now rented through its Invitation Homes LP.\par \par \uc2 The proposed merger of Starwood Waypoint and Colony is a bet that the percentage of Americans who own homes will remain unusually low. While the foreclosure crisis has receded, toughened lending standards have pushed millions of Americans out of the homebuying market.\par \par \uc2 Higher interest rates would increase borrowing costs and make it harder for some renters to buy homes.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  decided last week not to raise short-term interest rates from near zero, where they have held since 2008, but the central bank is expected to revisit the matter later this year.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. homeownership rate is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, falling to 63.5% in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, single-family rentals now add up to 13% of overall housing stock, up from 9% in 2005, according to a report by \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rents have been climbing steadily, though some analysts and investors question how long it can last, especially in areas with weak wage growth. Many of the rental homes scooped up by big investors are in those parts of the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The single-family rental home business was long dominated by mom-and-pop operators. Big investors have used their access to capital and number-crunching skill to barrel into the market. Starwood Waypoint touts algorithms it has developed to guide decisions that include which neighborhoods to target.\par \par \uc2 The response from stock-market investors has been mostly tepid so far.\par \par \uc2 As of Friday, Starwood Waypoint shares were down about 20% since its spinoff from \uc2 Starwood Property Trust\uc2  last year. Shares of \uc2 American Homes 4 Rent\uc2 , which owned 37,491 homes in 22 states as of June 30, have risen 2.7% since their stock-market debut in August 2013.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  executives have said they plan to eventually list shares of Invitation Homes through an initial public offering.\par \par \uc2 Bond buyers have been more enthusiastic, snapping up the debt issued by some companies in the sector.\par \par \uc2 In the two years since \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 's Invitation Homes sold the first bond backed by rents from a pool of houses, $13 billion of such bonds have been sold, according to \uc2 Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Single-family rental companies must convince investors that the single-family rental model will remain viable if homeownership levels rebound. Some outsiders also question how much more firms like \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 , Colony and Starwood Waypoint can grow now that so many of the most deeply discounted foreclosed homes have been purchased.\par \par \uc2 Single-family rental companies also face questions about their ability to maintain tens of thousands of scattered properties. The chores include cutting lawns, fixing sinks, insurance and keeping track of rental rates and payments.\par \par \uc2 Big investors need to amass enough market share to keep their operating costs in check.\par \par \uc2 In June, Starwood Waypoint said the company and other institutional investors owned roughly 200,000 of the 15.3 million U.S. rental homes, suggesting significant room for expansion if other conditions are ripe.\par \par \uc2 Executives at Starwood Waypoint and Colony believe that combining the two companies would boost investor comfort and confidence in the single-family rental home business, according to people familiar with the merger talks.\par \par \uc2 The two companies believe that a merger would result in as much as $50 million in cost reductions, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 If the deal goes through, Colony investors would own 59% of the combined company's shares, while Starwood Waypoint shareholders would own 41%. Starwood Waypoint would issue new shares as part of the merger.\par \par \uc2 Terms of the proposed deal call for Messrs. Sternlicht and Barrack to share chairmanship of the combined company.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150921000129"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150921eb9l00039\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MELBOURNE, Australia -- Consumer-credit reporting company \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . is seeking to break into the Australian market, pitching a takeover offer for one of the country's biggest credit-reference providers valued at about 2.28 billion Australian dollars (US$1.64 billion).\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  said on Friday it had made a nonbinding offer for Sydney-based \uc2 Veda Group Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 If a takeover is successful, it would give \uc2 Equifax\uc2  a substantial foothold in the region at the same time Australia is adopting a comprehensive credit-reporting policy that brings it into line with most of the developed world, including many of the countries where \uc2 Equifax\uc2  operates.\par \par \uc2 Veda said it received a cash offer from \uc2 Equifax\uc2  to buy the company at A$2.70 a share, a 35% premium to Veda's closing share price on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Veda's shares, which had fallen about 13% in 2015 ahead of the approach, jumped 31% on Friday to A$2.62.\par \par \uc2 "Veda is a strategic asset," said \uc2 Ed Prendergast\uc2 , a portfolio manager at Pengana Capital in Melbourne, which owns shares in the Australian company.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  has no meaningful presence in Australia or New Zealand, Mr. Prendergast said, adding that for it to build a business there from scratch would be costly and would take it many years to build up the necessary credit data to be considered a major rival.\par \par \uc2 Veda holds credit information on about 20 million individuals and 5.7 million businesses in Australia and New Zealand.\par \par \uc2 Atlanta-based \uc2 Equifax\uc2  said the proposal to buy Veda was financially compelling, and consistent with its strategy to expand into new markets.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  ranks among the market leading credit data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  providers in the U.S., Brazil, Canada and more than a dozen other countries. In early 2014 it bought U.K.-based debt-management software company \uc2 TDX Group\uc2 , which has a regional office in Sydney.\par \par \uc2 Veda said its board would evaluate the offer, although there was no certainty it would result in a firm bid or that the terms would be acceptable.\par \par \uc2 Any offer is subject to conditions including due diligence and approval from regulators, including Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, which advises the government on foreign takeovers, it said.\par \par \uc2 The offer comes as Australia adopts comprehensive credit reporting, an effort to expand credit-history sharing under a voluntary reporting system adopted by the financial industry. Analysts have said the system, which is expected to take several years to roll out fully, promises a boost in revenue for companies such as Veda because it will open up additional information about the accounts individuals have and how well they meet repayments.\par \par \uc2 Veda reported a net profit of A$78.4 million on revenue of A$338.8 million in the year through June.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20150920000050"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020150920eb9l00019\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Majority of central bank officials still expect to increase rates this year\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  left short-term interest rates unchanged after weeks of market-churning debate, putting off a historic move to end an era of ultra-cheap credit amid worries about weak growth overseas.\par \par \uc2 While central-bank officials don't believe recent global economic and market turbulence will throw the U.S. economy off track, they want to be sure before they push rates higher.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn light of the developments that we have seen and the impacts on financial markets, we want to take a little bit more time to evaluate the likely impacts on the United States," Fed Chairwoman \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  said Thursday at a press conference following a two-day policy meeting.\par \par \uc2 The decision left uncertain for a while longer just when the Fed would raise its benchmark rate, which has been near zero since December 2008. Most of the policy makers at the meeting, 13 of 17, indicated they still expect to move this year, but that was down from the 15 who held that view in June. The central bank has two more scheduled policy meetings this year, in late October and mid-December.\par \par \uc2 U.S. stock markets gyrated after the Fed announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 65.21 points, or 0.4%, to 16674.74. Meanwhile, the yield on two-year \uc2 Treasury\uc2  notes, which in part reflects market expectations of rate movements in the medium-term, posted its largest single-day decline since late December 2010.\par \par \uc2 The decision to leave rates unchanged, after months of discussion about raising them, reflected in part Ms. Yellen's cautious nature as an individual and leader.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Yale University\uc2 -trained Ph.D. economist is known inside the central bank for liking to arrive at airports hours before departure and preparing weeks in advance for big speeches, reflections of a desire to avoid unnecessary surprises. Moving rates now, at a time of uncertainty about the economic outlook, would have been out of character for her.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe central aspect of her nature on this and other jobs is not to leave any stone unturned and to be really prepared and buttoned up. Much more often than not, that will lead to no surprises," said \uc2 Alan Blinder\uc2 , a \uc2 Princeton University\uc2  economics professor who served with Ms. Yellen at the Fed in 1994, when he was vice chairman and she was a governor. \u8220\'20\'1CHad the Fed raised interest rates today that would have really surprised markets for no good reason."\par \par \uc2 The Fed\uc2  cut its benchmark interest rate\u8212\'20\'14called the federal funds rate\u8212\'20\'14to near zero in December 2008, three months after the collapse of \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  and ensuing financial chaos. It has kept the rate there ever since, an effort to encourage borrowing, spending and investing to boost economic growth more broadly.\par \par \uc2 Low rates have spurred a boom in auto sales and upturns in some financial sectors, like commercial real estate, but not broad economic vigor. They have also been accompanied by a steady drop in the official unemployment rate from 10% in 2009 to 5.1% in August.\par \par \uc2 Many officials, including Ms. Yellen, believe the drop in the jobless rate indicates that slack in the economy is gradually getting eaten up and will eventually lead to a pickup in inflation. \uc2 The Fed\uc2 's preferred measure of inflation has run below its 2% objective for more than three years and the Fed reiterated Thursday that it doesn't want to start raising rates until officials are more confident inflation will rise toward that target.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen emphasized, and Fed officials' forecasts underscored, that policy makers still expect to raise the short-term interest rate\u8212\'20\'14which is a rate banks charge each other on overnight loans\u8212\'20\'14before year-end.\par \par \uc2 However, some economists say the Fed now risks waiting too long to act.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe longer they wait, the more difficult their job is going to be 12 or 18 months from now," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Mr. Zandi said the jobless rate, at 5.1%, is near levels where pressures could start building that cause inflation or asset-price bubbles. He expects it to move below 5%, a key marker of a healthy and stable level for unemployment, in a matter of months.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe main risk is that they now wait too long and that then they have to play catchup and have to raise rates very aggressively and undermine economic growth," he said.\par \par \uc2 Easy-money advocates cheered the Fed's decision. David Blanchflower, a \uc2 Dartmouth College\uc2  economist and former policy maker at the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 , said the Fed has bigger problems than the potential for asset bubbles, namely a labor market that remains far from full health, as evidenced by slow growth in wages.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe'll worry down the road about those things," Mr. Blanchflower said. \u8220\'20\'1CWe have real things to worry about right now, rather than those maybes."\par \par \uc2 Taylor Greene, 23 years old, said he was relieved that the Fed opted against raising interest rates on Thursday because he has been saving to buy a house. \u8220\'20\'1CThere's that pressure to get in before rates go up and prices go up," said Mr. Greene, who currently rents a condominium in Tempe, Ariz.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Greene, an analyst at a consulting firm, said he'd paid little attention until recently to the Fed. \u8220\'20\'1CBefore now, I had been focused on just getting money into my savings account for that down payment," he said. Now, his rent is rising, and he's ready to move. \u8220\'20\'1CWith the market really picking up steam, you wonder, \u8216\'20\'18What is the Fed going to do? How are they going to respond to this?' "\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen said officials discussed raising rates now, and she saw the merits of the case to move. But caution won over the chairwoman and others.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAn argument can be made for a rise in interest rates at this time," she said. But she said officials decided to hold off \u8220\'20\'1Cin light of the heightened uncertainties abroad" and the prospect of low inflation for a longer period. \uc2 The Fed\uc2  wants \u8220\'20\'1Ca little bit more time" to make sure the U.S. economic outlook hasn't fundamentally shifted, she said.\par \par \uc2 After a series of unanimous policy votes this year, Thursday's vote was 9-1. \uc2 Jeffrey Lacker\uc2 , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, dissented, calling for a rate increase now.\par \par \uc2 The dissent underscored divisions that are building inside the central bank about how to proceed. Six officials submitted projections before the meeting that called for two interest-rate increases this year, which suggests Mr. Lacker has backing for the call to start moving. Not all of the 17 Fed bank president and board governors who attend the meeting actually vote for the decision, which explains why only one dissented while others want to start.\par \par \uc2 Fed officials have several worries at the moment. Growth in China has slowed and might be on a softer path than expected. Ms. Yellen appeared to let slip an unusual knock on how Chinese officials are handling the slowdown in the world's second largest economy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDevelopments that we saw in financial markets in August, in part, reflected concerns that there was downside risk to Chinese economic performance and perhaps concerns about the deftness in which policy makers were addressing those concerns," she said.\par \par \uc2 Another worry is the strength of the U.S. dollar, which has appreciated 8% against a broad basket of other currencies this year. The stronger currency puts downward pressure on exports and import prices, movements at odds with the Fed efforts to spur economic growth and raise currently low inflation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CRecent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near-term," the Fed said in the official policy statement released by the central bank after the meeting. It added that it was \u8220\'20\'1Cmonitoring developments abroad," a signal of the Fed's heightened state of worry that slow growth outside the U.S. could hurt the American economy.\par \par \uc2 Fed officials have been signaling for months they plan to raise rates this year. Central to their optimism is a view labor markets are improving rapidly and reducing slack in the economy, a precursor to some lift in inflation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COn balance, labor market indicators show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year," the Fed said in its policy statement.\par \par \uc2 Before the meeting, investors had come to believe the Fed wouldn't move. In futures markets before the meeting, traders attached a 27% probability to a rate increase Thursday, but a 64% probability to an increase by December, according to calculations made by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. After the meeting they saw a 45% probability of a move by December.\par \par \uc2 Their projected path of rates has become shallower in recent months. The median projection for rates at the end of 2015 dropped to 0.375% from 0.625% in June. It also dropped to 1.375% at the end of 2016 from 1.625% projected in June. It fell to 2.625% at the end of 2017 from 2.875% projected in June. In the long-run the Fed projected the fed funds rate will reach 3.5%, down from an earlier estimate of 3.75%.\par \par \uc2 One reason for the shifting outlook: Officials have become a bit less optimistic about the economy's long-run growth potential. They projected the economy will grow at a rate between 1.8% and 2.2% per year in the long-run, down from their June estimate of growth of 2.0% to 2.3% in the long-run. A more lumbering economy has less capacity to bear much higher rates.\par \par \uc2 The Fed\uc2 's economic projections underscored the challenge officials face in reading the current economic backdrop. Fed officials reduced their estimates for the path of the unemployment rate. They see it reaching 5.0% by year end and 4.8% by the end of next year, a lower rate than previous estimates of 5.3% and 5.1% respectively.\par \par \uc2 Textbooks suggest that as estimates for the jobless rate fall, estimates for inflation should rise. But officials reduced their inflation estimates, thanks in part to downward pressures from lower oil prices and a stronger dollar. They don't see the inflation rate, as measured by the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, reaching their goal of 2% until 2018, near the end of Ms. Yellen's first term as chairwoman.\par \par \uc2 Nick Timiraos and Ben Leubsdorf contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jon Hilsenrath at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150917eb9h0070y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Tianhe said it will try to find a new auditor.\par \par \uc2 Trading in Tianhe's shares has been halted at the company's request since March. Tianhe at the time said it needed more time to provide further information to its auditors concerning its 2014 annual results, which haven't been released.\par \par \uc2 In August, Tianhe said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange that \u8220\'20\'1Cthere are three areas where the Auditor considers that its concerns have not been fully addressed" and which were delaying the publication of the 2014 results. Tianhe said in the filing its audit committee had conducted an investigation into the issues cited by Deloitte.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , an early investor in Tianhe through a private-equity unit, owns a stake of about 8.9% in the company and is the second-largest shareholder after the Wei family, according to filings.\par \par \uc2 Chester Yung contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Julie Steinberg at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:julie.steinberg@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 julie.steinberg@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150918eb9i001xi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

They have come for the king of the financial data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business and missed.\par \par \uc2 Now comes Symphony, a start-up messaging service and technology platform, nurtured by \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  in its tussle with Bloomberg. This is a problem: if there is one organisation that other banks and investment managers resent more than Bloomberg, it is Goldman. On past form, Symphony's launch this week could be written off.\par \par \uc2 That would be an error, not because Symphony itself is bound to succeed but because it need not kill Bloomberg to do so. It is not attacking the target head-on, like Bloomberg rivals such as Thomson Reuters. It is using another approach to technology to compete in a different way, just as Android, the open source mobile platform supported by \uc2 Google\uc2 , took on Apple's closed world.\par \par \uc2 It may flourish - and even if it does not, its model could work for someone else. Technology has evolved, making it easier for rivals both to compete with each other and to attack a bigger foe. The fact that 14 others, including BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, joined Goldman to back Symphony shows that something has changed.\par \par \uc2 Bloomberg has always appeared to be vulnerable: its orange and black screens; its weird array of keyboard commands; its reliance for 80 per cent of its $8.5bn annual revenues on selling terminals at a fixed price of $21,000 per year each, with no discount even if they are used only to send messages; its cult-like internal culture created by Michael Bloomberg , its founder.\par \par \uc2 Yet it prospers because, despite the requirement for its 325,000 terminal users to learn an entirely new language, it focuses relentlessly on serving them. The terminal seamlessly integrates data, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , messages, and even the ability to trade derivatives and bonds. If something is wrong, or feels wrong, the user calls and it gets fixed.\par \par \uc2 Bloomberg is more than a network; it is a community . A portfolio manager can chat online about a trade with a salesperson at an investment bank, review a spreadsheet and other data, and execute it, all within their Bloomberg terminals. It is the virtual equivalent of the old-style stock exchange, a gathering place for everyone in the finance business. This makes it, as a rival says enviously, "very sticky".\par \par \uc2 How do you attack it? With difficulty, many have found. Thomson Reuters, its main rival, steadily lost ground despite launching fightbacks and "Bloomberg killers" - its market share in 2014 was 26 per cent compared with Bloomberg's 32 per cent , according to Burton-Taylor, a research group. Upstarts such as FactSet, Markit and Capital IQ are growing but are relatively small.\par \par \uc2 One crack appeared in 2013 when Bloomberg journalists were found to have observed subscriber activity for stories . Goldman, which pays for 2,500 Bloomberg terminals, and was developing its own messaging and communication system, protested loudly. It later folded this software into Symphony to encourage others to join.\par \par \uc2 Banks used not to worry about paying Bloomberg's bill. But times are tougher - tighter regulation has hurt their bond and currency trading divisions. Bloomberg is also competing more directly with them by letting users execute trades directly, rather than using bank-backed electronic trading platforms such as TradeWeb.\par \par \uc2 No matter how angry Wall Street got about such trends, it could not have done much about them were it not for the evolution in technology. Open source software, cloud computing and the internet have made it simpler to compete with networks such as Bloomberg. Symphony need not do everything - it can build a platform and let others write software and applications.\par \par \uc2 This will be less like Bloomberg than a Wall Street app store, on which a data provider such as Markit, a bank such as Goldman, or an asset manager such as BlackRock offers pricing and data widgets, or integrates theirs with others. Some services will be private, with only a few users; others open to all.\par \par \uc2 It will also be far cheaper - from only about $15 per month for the basic message service . Goldman wanted to build its own messaging network so all of its 35,000 employees - from operations and back-office staff to analysts - could communicate even if they did not have a Bloomberg terminal. Symphony similarly aims to spread widely rather than seizing the high ground.\par \par \uc2 The biggest obstacle is the buyside - the asset managers and hedge funds at which Bloomberg is entrenched, where a new service is another screen to cram on to a desk. Symphony will appeal to investment banks with thousands of back office employees, but what about hedge funds with only a few?\par \par \uc2 It may yet rise up the ranks, spread across the buyside, and knock the king off the throne but that is unlikely. Although Wall Street has fallen on comparatively hard times, it still has deep enough pockets to buy Bloomberg terminals for the elite traders and salespeople who want them.\par \par \uc2 Symphony will not kill Bloomberg. But it, or something like it, could make a big impact by being different. That counts as success.\par \par \uc2 john.gapper@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150917eb9h0002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The hulking art deco structure at 1355 Market St. in San Francisco is an 11-story former wholesale furniture mart in the gritty Mid-Market neighborhood, where drug addicts and homeless people dot the sidewalks.\par \par \uc2 So how is it among the most valuable office buildings ever sold in the city?\par \par \uc2 The property known as Market Square, home to \uc2 Twitter Inc\uc2 .'s headquarters, is one of a growing handful of low-slung former industrial buildings that are fetching prices on par with top-quality office towers. Now filled with fast-growing technology and media companies, these offbeat buildings are challenging the notion of the downtown skyscraper as the dominant symbol of corporate real estate.\par \par \uc2 Big investors and banks are piling in, sending prices skyward in large U.S. markets, for two simple reasons: The rents are high and the buildings are full.\par \par \uc2 A fund run by the \uc2 Shorenstein Co\uc2 . in recent weeks sold a 98% interest in Market Square to a venture led by \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 .'s asset-management arm for about $835 per square foot, valuing it at about $920 million, people familiar with the deal said. That would be the highest price per square foot paid for a large office building in the city since 2007, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  LLC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Less than a mile away, a five-story former jewelry mart where \uc2 Airbnb Inc\uc2 . has its headquarters is being sold by Beacon Capital Partners to asset manager \uc2 TIAA-CREF\uc2  for about $735 per square foot. The price of the building, nestled below a set of elevated highway ramps far from the BART subway, is near the $770 per square foot that \uc2 Salesforce.com Inc\uc2 . paid earlier this year for a giant office tower downtown.\par \par \uc2 Further south in Los Angeles, a 464,000-square-foot century-old office building sold last week for $200 million, in what the seller said was a record price per square foot for downtown Los Angeles. Before selling it, developer Rising Realty stripped out its offices and carpeting, filling it up with startups.\par \par \uc2 Nearby, Shorenstein is nearing another big deal. The company is in talks with online media startup \uc2 BuzzFeed Inc\uc2 . to rent a century-old former \uc2 Ford Motor Co\uc2 . factory for which it paid $37 million last year, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Ever since the recession, the market for office space has been shifting, with technology companies and media organizations showing a preference for office space with character. Often referred to loosely as "creative space," it usually entails vast swaths of open space, low or nonexistent cubicle walls, exposed brick walls and bare ceilings. Couches, foosball tables and even beer kegs are commonplace.\par \par \uc2 Corporate towers, by contrast, are often viewed as sterile offices of a past generation, the province of those who must wear suits and ties to the office.\par \par \uc2 But because there are only so many brick warehouses to go around, demand has outstripped supply, pushing rents up near those typically paid by private-equity firms or banks.\par \par \uc2 Take the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles, where tech companies including \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . have offices. Asking rents in the area for such creative space average about $41 per square foot, well above the $24 per square foot sought for traditional office buildings in the area, says real-estate-services firm JLL.\par \par \uc2 "These tenants are paying the rent," said Carl Muhlstein, a Los Angeles-based broker with JLL who has focused on creative office space. Mr. Muhlstein helped fill a former \uc2 U.S. Postal Service\uc2  sorting facility in the neighborhood that was converted to an office building aimed at media and tech companies. After it was leased with tenants like \uc2 Sony Corp\uc2 .'s PlayStation division, it sold earlier this year to \uc2 Invesco Ltd\uc2 . for more than $800 a square foot. By comparison, the 24-story tower at 801 S. Figueroa St. in downtown Los Angeles sold late last year for $430 per square foot, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Shorenstein was early in capitalizing on the trend. The San Francisco company, known in prior generations for its holdings of skyscrapers, bought the building at 1355 Market for $110 million in 2011 and embarked on a renovation dazzling enough to lure \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . As the tech industry took off, the neighborhood began to transform, with companies like \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . gobbling up space. Rents rose, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  expanded, and the building filled up.\par \par \uc2 Warehouse-like spaces are catching on even in New York, where rents topping $100 were once reserved for trophy towers in Manhattan on the edge of Central Park. Now buildings in former manufacturing areas like the Meatpacking District and the area south of Union Square are fetching such rents as available space is filled up by companies including \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . A handful of boxy new buildings planned for these neighborhoods are aiming for rents as high as $150 per square foot.\par \par \uc2 Vornado Realty Trust\uc2 , a major owner of trophy New York towers, is also making a big push into offbeat office districts. It recently announced a $190 million deal to buy a building in the West Chelsea neighborhood north of the Meatpacking District, where it has become one of the largest landlords.\par \par \uc2 Nontraditional buildings are "in incredibly high demand by the class of tenant that doesn't want to work in a 'Class A' building with a lot of old guys that wear ties," said \uc2 Steven Roth\uc2 , chief executive of Vornado.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20150915000043"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020150915eb9g0000v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

A number of smaller lenders have criticised a proposed new bank tax that they say will disproportionately hit the sector.\par \par \uc2 Tandem, which will offer consumer products including current accounts and mortgages, is understood to have raised nearly \u163\'00\'A3100m in capital, backed by a group of 10 institutional investors.\par \par \uc2 Mr Knox said that it would aim to work with people to manage their money, rather than focusing on product sales.\par \par \uc2 The lender plans to mine "\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 " to better tailor products to customers' requirements.\par \par \uc2 Mr Knox, who founded Tandem with Matt Cooper, a former director of \uc2 Capital One Bank\uc2 , claimed the team had an advanced credit rating and scoring process to underpin efficient lending decisions.\par \par \uc2 He said the business wanted to "provide this service for everyday people over the smartphone".\par \par \uc2 Unlike Atom, Mr Knox said Tandem would not be digital-only, as it would also provide a call-centre.\par \par \uc2 "We expect people will use mobile as the primary banking channel, and the call-centre for large transactions," he said.\par \par \uc2 But he added that the lender was "never going to be for customers who need a branch. We have a lot of cost advantages as a result and can offer cheaper products, with no legacy issues or old IT systems".\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150915eb9f00013\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

ADVENTUROUS INVESTOR\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Stevenson   \par \uc2 852 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 September 2015\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 07\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 The Financial Times Ltd.

Barely a week goes by without some new crowdfunding campaign or peer-to-peer loan launch.\par \par \uc2 Some are sensible, some less so. But Zopa, the sector pioneer, has built a very solid franchise that increasingly smells like a mainstream financial services business online. Its deadly rival Ratesetter has also branched out into new forms of lending.\par \par \uc2 At the other end of the alternative finance spectrum we have riskier crowdfunding campaigns, some of which offer equity investments at ludicrous valuations, and even more ludicrous projections for growth. Yet I have no doubt that lurking on platforms such as \uc2 Crowdcube\uc2 , \uc2 Seedrs\uc2  and Syndicate Room, there will be more than a handful of great new businesses that will make the leap on to the public markets (not least the platforms themselves).\par \par \uc2 But some innovations worry me. Mini-bonds are one. Now, I'm a great fan of retail friendly bonds. The Order book for Retail Bonds (Orb) at the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  has been fruitful for bond investors and I'm very happy with my own investments in bonds issued by \uc2 Tesco Personal Finance\uc2 , EnQuest, \uc2 Premier Oil\uc2  and \uc2 Provident Financial\uc2  bonds.\par \par \uc2 As the yield on many of the best issues has fallen below 5 per cent, many investors have gone in search of yield higher up the risk spectrum, chasing all sorts of new issuers, many of them using alternative finance platforms.\par \par \uc2 Let's compare two recent issues - Iwoca's bond placing on the UK Bond Network, and Scottish company BrewDog's immensely popular listing on \uc2 Crowdcube\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 UK Bond Network tends to focus on structuring issues that look and feel more like traditional bond structures. There's a focus on more established businesses, with asset backed security, and higher yields for the extra risk being taken. The Iwoca issue, raising \u163\'00\'A31m, offered sophisticated private investors a return of 9 per cent for one year, with yield payments secured on Iwoca's short term loans to small and medium-sized businesses.\par \par \uc2 Crowdcube\uc2  has also done a brilliant job in bringing bonds into the UK market through its own mini-bond platform, giving investors a fairly constant stream of issues that pay a yield of between 6 per cent and 9 per cent depending on the nature of the business.\par \par \uc2 BrewDog is an established business. It has raised countless millions via its " Equity for Punks " programme - the 2015 issue was the fourth iteration of equity fundraising. But having raised \u163\'00\'A314m via this route - not uncontroversially it must be said, given some of the detail in its fundraising documents - the Scottish brewer is now looking to raise money for a "BrewDog Bond". This is a mini-bond and will hopefully raise up to \u163\'00\'A36m, and pay out a 6.5 per cent fixed rate per annum.\par \par \uc2 In many respects there's much to like about this issue. Bonds are more secure than equities (usually), and the fact that \uc2 Crowdcube\uc2  has agreed to market the BrewDog bond should give investors some comfort. \uc2 Crowdcube\uc2  has even tied up with debt rating firm \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to attach a "Probability of Default" (POD) score to mini-bonds, judging the issuer's likelihood of default on any existing credit obligations (not including the mini-bond). At the launch of the BrewDog programme, the average POD for \uc2 Crowdcube\uc2  mini-bonds was 3.3 per cent. \uc2 Moody's\uc2  awarded the BrewDog Bond a 0.3 per cent POD.\par \par \uc2 Like virtually all mini-bonds this issue is unsecured and non-transferable. Interest repayments will be made biannually. The term appears to be four years and the minimum investment is \u163\'00\'A3500.\par \par \uc2 For me, investors need to ask two questions. First, will they get their money back? The second is are they adequately rewarded for the risk? I'd say that both Iwoca and BrewDog probably pass the first test. BrewDog in particular has been growing like gangbusters - an average of 138 per cent a year since 2007 - and is a well-known brand. It's also raised a huge amount of equity, which will need to be burnt through before bonds are threatened.\par \par \uc2 But I'm not sure I am adequately rewarded for the risk as 6.5 per cent for four years strikes me as parsimonious. Iwoca's 9 per cent for one year is a much better bet. A lot can happen in four years, including interest rate rises, global recessions, regulatory changes and the chance of good old-fashioned business failure.\par \par \uc2 Frankly, yields of 6 to 8 per cent can be had from investing in stock market funds such as \uc2 P2P Global Investments\uc2  and SQN Asset Finance, which lend to hundreds of small businesses. Unless issuers up the rates I'd be very cautious about committing your capital to many of these mini-bonds.\par \par \uc2 David Stevenson\uc2  is an active private investor writing about his own investments. He may own shares in the companies mentioned. adventurous@ft.com\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150914eb9c0005f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

There were nearly 1,300 trading halts, most of them in the first part of the day, and some stocks dropped rapidly before recouping losses in a matter of minutes.\par \par \uc2 "Frankly, some of the things that went on that day need very close scrutiny," Mr. Grasso said in an interview Friday with the Journal. "A day like that, where \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's shares go from $86 to $72 to $84 in a matter of minutes will cause the public to lose confidence in the markets."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso stepped down from the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  in 2003 after a controversy over the nearly $140 million he received in retirement pay, deferred compensation and benefits that year.\par \par \uc2 He led the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  at a time when it was the dominant venue for trading stocks, handling roughly 80% of all transactions. Members of the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  earned high salaries, and the exchange reflected their wealth, featuring a high-end Luncheon Club where traders dined on steak and oysters amid artwork and wild game mounted on the wall.\par \par \uc2 For the most part, Mr. Grasso is no longer involved in the securities market. He serves as a member of the advisory board of the Delaware Board of Trade Holdings Inc., which is aiming to build a stock exchange for startups.\par \par \uc2 Some market observers said Mr. Grasso's views were out of date. David Weisberger, managing director at the market-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm RegOne Solutions, said it cost investors much more to trade stock during Mr. Grasso's era, because specialists on the floor of the exchange had more control over trading.\par \par \uc2 "The market now is far more egalitarian than it's ever been," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso also criticized how exchanges sold proprietary feeds of stock-trading data to some clients, while many in the market relied on a slower feed.\par \par \uc2 "Creating an advantage to an institutional user or a particular type of trader that disadvantages the retail investor is bad for the country, bad for the markets and bad for your business," he said in the television interview.\par \par \uc2 Exchanges have said the proprietary feeds contain information that only some market participants are interested in, such as the full list of all orders to buy or sell a stock at certain prices. They say such data is too voluminous and fast-changing for an everyday investor to use for trading.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, \uc2 NYSE\uc2 , a part of \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Nasdaq Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 BATS Global Markets Inc\uc2 . all declined to comment. Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., also has repeatedly said the U.S. stock market is too complex and has called on participants to agree to simplify it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso added in the television interview that Regulation NMS, which stands for national market system and was designed to link all the U.S. markets, was a "sad, sad experiment."\par \par \uc2 The regulation, which was passed by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  in 2005 and implemented in 2007, was designed to ensure investors got the best price available on any public U.S. market. It knitted together all the exchanges and trading venues across the country to create a single, though disparate, market. It required transactions be conducted at the "national best bid or offer," meaning each venue had to continuously check the prices available at competitors to verify a transaction was compliant. It also meant the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  no longer had a monopoly on trading in its own listed stocks, helping spur a host of competitors.\par \par \uc2 The rules contributed to market hiccups like last month's swings because they allowed for a major expansion in the number of places where stocks could trade, he said.\par \par \uc2 "No one anticipated 60 different venues where an \uc2 IBM\uc2  or a \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  trades," he said during the television interview.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso told the Journal that he recommends a broad-based review of the markets as a first step toward addressing the problems he sees. He said such a review would involve participants from across the exchanges and regulatory agencies and would focus on "how to modernize the oversight structure to reflect what the market has become."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso said in the television interview that a good rule of thumb for market changes was to ensure that "little old grandma in tennis shoes" also benefited.\par \par \uc2 If "you've taken care of her, you've taken care of everyone else," he said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150912000131"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150912eb9c0003h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The former head of the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2  says modern markets have sacrificed fairness for speed.\par \par \uc2 Richard Grasso, chairman and chief executive of the NYSE from 1995 to 2003, said in an interview to be broadcast Sunday for the television show \u8220\'20\'1CWall Street Week" that the market swings last month were a sign something was awry with the capital markets.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA fast market is not necessarily a fair market, as evidenced by that Monday open," he said in a clip of the interview viewed by The Wall Street Journal, referring to the tumultuous early trading on Aug. 24.\par \par \uc2 The action that day has drawn scrutiny from regulators, exchanges, institutions and everyday investors\u8212\'20\'14and sparked discussions about how to tweak the market to prevent similar problems. There were nearly 1,300 trading halts, most of them in the first part of the day, and some stocks dropped rapidly before recouping losses in a matter of minutes.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFrankly, some of the things that went on that day need very close scrutiny," Mr. Grasso said in an interview Friday with the Journal. \u8220\'20\'1CA day like that, where \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's shares go from $86 to $72 to $84 in a matter of minutes will cause the public to lose confidence in the markets."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso stepped down from the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  in 2003 after a controversy over the nearly $140 million he received in retirement pay, deferred compensation and benefits that year.\par \par \uc2 He led the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  at a time when it was the dominant venue for trading stocks, handling roughly 80% of all transactions. Members of the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  earned high salaries, and the exchange reflected their wealth, featuring a high-end Luncheon Club where traders dined on steak and oysters amid artwork and wild game mounted on the wall.\par \par \uc2 For the most part, Mr. Grasso is no longer involved in the securities market. He serves as a member of the advisory board of the Delaware Board of Trade Holdings Inc., which is aiming to build a stock exchange for startups.\par \par \uc2 Some market observers said Mr. Grasso's views were out of date. David Weisberger, managing director at the market-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm RegOne Solutions, said it cost investors much more to trade stock during Mr. Grasso's era, because specialists on the floor of the exchange had more control over trading.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe market now is far more egalitarian than it's ever been," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso also criticized how exchanges sold proprietary feeds of stock-trading data to some clients, while many in the market relied on a slower feed.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCreating an advantage to an institutional user or a particular type of trader that disadvantages the retail investor is bad for the country, bad for the markets and bad for your business," he said in the television interview.\par \par \uc2 Exchanges have said the proprietary feeds contain information that only some market participants are interested in, such as the full list of all orders to buy or sell a stock at certain prices. They say such data is too voluminous and fast-changing for an everyday investor to use for trading.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, \uc2 NYSE\uc2 , a part of \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Nasdaq Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 BATS Global Markets Inc\uc2 . all declined to comment. Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., also has repeatedly said the U.S. stock market is too complex and has called on participants to agree to simplify it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso added in the television interview that Regulation NMS, which stands for national market system and was designed to link all the U.S. markets, was a \u8220\'20\'1Csad, sad experiment."\par \par \uc2 The regulation, which was passed by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  in 2005 and implemented in 2007, was designed to ensure investors got the best price available on any public U.S. market. It knitted together all the exchanges and trading venues across the country to create a single, though disparate, market. It required transactions be conducted at the \u8220\'20\'1Cnational best bid or offer," meaning each venue had to continuously check the prices available at competitors to verify a transaction was compliant. It also meant the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  no longer had a monopoly on trading in its own listed stocks, helping spur a host of competitors.\par \par \uc2 The rules contributed to market hiccups like last month's swings because they allowed for a major expansion in the number of places where stocks could trade, he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo one anticipated 60 different venues where an \uc2 IBM\uc2  or a \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  trades," he said during the television interview.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso told the Journal that he recommends a broad-based review of the markets as a first step toward addressing the problems he sees. He said such a review would involve participants from across the exchanges and regulatory agencies and would focus on \u8220\'20\'1Chow to modernize the oversight structure to reflect what the market has become."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grasso said in the television interview that a good rule of thumb for market changes was to ensure that \u8220\'20\'1Clittle old grandma in tennis shoes" also benefited.\par \par \uc2 If \u8220\'20\'1Cyou've taken care of her, you've taken care of everyone else," he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Bradley Hope at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:bradley.hope@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bradley.hope@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150911eb9b005mt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Peterson\uc2 , a former \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . executive, said in a prepared statement on Tuesday that Mr. Sahai \u8220\'20\'1Chas been a key leader at \uc2 S&P\uc2  Ratings during a critical period, overseeing the implementation of significant, global regulatory requirements while at the same time strengthening the financial performance of the business."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sahai {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304011304579219770027877240"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 joined S&P Ratings}}}\uc2 from Citi in early 2014. Most recently before joining \uc2 S&P\uc2 , he was head of Citi's securities and fund services business and acted as chief fiduciary officer of the bank.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, McGraw Hill reached settlements\u8212\'20\'14which cost the firm more than $1.5 billion\u8212\'20\'14that resolved government lawsuits and investigations tied to the \uc2 S&P\uc2  Ratings unit. The cases involved \uc2 S&P\uc2 's ratings of mortgage-bond deals before and after the 2008 financial crisis. \par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, the company also named Mike Chinn, former president and CEO of SNL Financial, as president of the combined \uc2 S&P Capital IQ/SNL Financial\uc2 . Mr. Chinn, who started at SNL as an analyst in 1994, had been president of SNL for 10 years and was named CEO in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Peterson said placing the combined \uc2 S&P Capital IQ/SNL Financial\uc2  under the leadership of Mr. Chinn best positions the business for opportunities in the global markets it serves.\par \par \uc2 S&P Capital IQ\uc2 , which is McGraw Hill's second-largest division by revenue, after its ratings business, provides real-time financial data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to investment banks, money managers and corporations. SNL is best known as a provider of in-depth banking industry data and analysis, but more than a third of SNL's revenue comes from nonbanking areas that include energy, insurance and real estate. Since 2012, SNL has aggressively expanded into metals and mining.\par \par \uc2                 Imogen Dillon Hatcher, who was president of \uc2 S&P Capital IQ\uc2  since November 2014, was named as president of McGraw Hill's Platts business. \uc2 Ms. Dillon Hatcher\uc2  joined \uc2 S&P Capital IQ\uc2  in April 2014 in the newly created role of chief commercial officer and was named president in late 2014, as the unit aimed to build up its international business and help \uc2 McGraw Hill Financial\uc2  diversify beyond its credit ratings business. She succeeds \uc2 Larry Neal\uc2 , who is retiring from the post he held since 2009, though he will remain as a senior adviser reporting to Mr. Peterson through year's end. \par \par \uc2 McGraw Hill also named its executive vice president of human resources, \uc2 John Berisford\uc2 , as acting president of \uc2 S&P\uc2  Ratings. The company credited Mr. Berisford for playing a key role in the separation and sale of McGraw Hill Education in 2013. \par \par \uc2                 Corrections & Amplifications:                 \uc2 Neeraj Sahai\uc2  resigned as president of \uc2 McGraw Hill Financial Inc\uc2 .'s Standard & Poor Ratings Services. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated his surname in the third and fourth paragraphs.

It is not surprising: after turning the company round over the past three years, he still faces residual scepticism, fresh challenges and outside expectations about how corporate Italy should act.\par \par \uc2 "This is a company that is coming back," he insists of the insurer, whose share price has nearly doubled since he took the top job three years ago. A competitive road cyclist in his free time, he sits on the edge of his chair in Generali's Milan headquarters, his foot persistently tapping as if reaching for unseen pedals.\par \par \uc2 "Generali is coming back from nowhere because we started from a very low level," he says. "We are changing gear. We are finishing a turnround story and we are opening a value story, which is a significant change. To people who say 'you haven't fixed it', [I say] 'look at the numbers'."\par \par \uc2 Mr Greco, who studied international economics in the US and started his career at McKinsey, is in the vanguard of a rising generation in Italian capitalism.\par \par \uc2 His pugilistic talk is new at the top of corporate Italy - but he is not alone. His fellow CEOs at the country's leading companies, such as \uc2 Intesa Sanpaolo\uc2 , \uc2 Telecom Italia\uc2 , Eni and \uc2 Enel\uc2 , were all installed after the financial crisis and the eurozone sovereign crisis crashed share prices. All are confronting tough turnrounds at their respective businesses after the drubbing dealt by the crises. And all are faced with the task of restoring corporate Italy's image in the outside world, marred by a long economic stagnation and a reputation for crony capitalism.\par \par \uc2 Mr Greco, 56, joined Generali from \uc2 Zurich Insurance Group\uc2  in the heat of the eurozone debt crisis. The board, in a typically bloody Italian board coup, had just ousted its chairman, Cesare Ger-onzi, and CEO, Giovanni Perissinotto, in swift succession after the insurer lost two-thirds of its value in five years.\par \par \uc2 Mr Greco's appointment was significant because of the size of the group - Generali has \u8364\'20\'AC500bn in assets under management, a behemoth in a country dominated by small and midsized businesses - and its place in Italian corporate culture.\par \par \uc2 The insurer under its old guard was an example of the type of Italian crony capitalism that raises a red flag for foreign investors in the eurozone's third-largest economy.\par \par \uc2 Generali sat amid a web of cross-shareholdings, which in the good times gave it unmatched influence but in the crises became the network through which contagion spread fast.\par \par \uc2 Mr Greco has cut costs and slashed its shareholdings in companies that included \uc2 Telecom Italia\uc2 , selling nearly \u8364\'20\'AC4bn in assets to boost its capital.\par \par \uc2 "People bet I would make a capital increase three years ago - they can keep on making this bet," he says. Mr Greco reiterates that he still has no intention to raise capital since the asset sales have boosted Generali's economic solvency ratio, a key measure of financial strength, to 186 per cent at the end of 2014, more in line with its peers Axa and \uc2 Allianz\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr Greco presents himself as a straight-talking numbers man, in a deliberate distinction from the avuncular manner of Italy's older executives.\par \par \uc2 Generali aims to pay \u8364\'20\'AC5bn in dividends over the next four yearscompared with \u8364\'20\'AC900m last year.\par \par \uc2 "We are now on a different journey to remunerate shareholders and increase the value of the company, and do that above the market average. This is completely new."\par \par \uc2 Mr Greco may have dragged Generali's governance and strategy into the 21st century but, like the leaders of many Italian businesses, he must now confront new problems spawned by technology and globalisation.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  warned earlier this year that the business models of European insurers are becoming un-sustainable after a dramatic fall in interest rates.\par \par \uc2 Mr Greco says he is prepared to deal with low bond yields "until 2018". He is shifting Generali's business mix to more fee-earning products to boost profits and away from life insurance, where setting up new contracts incurs heavy costs upfront. He also faces more competition arising from \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and is increasing spending on technology.\par \par \uc2 In addition, he has hired outsiders and foreigners to reflect Generali's presence in more than 60 countries with 78,000 employees and 72m customers. He hired New Delhi-born, Cambridge and Harvard-educated Nikhil Srinivasan as chief investment officer, who is now Italy's most prominent non-Italian executive.\par \par \uc2 His bet on new blood appears to have paid off. For 2014, Generali posted an investment return of 10 per cent on assets exceeding \u8364\'20\'AC400bn, which beat its peers, according to a report from research company Sanford Bernstein.\par \par \uc2 But for some analysts with the memory of eurozone crisis contagion still fresh, the focus remains on Generali's \u8364\'20\'AC50bn of Italian government debt and \u8364\'20\'AC90bn of Italian liabilities, which remain a concern and a sign that the effects of its change may be superficial.\par \par \uc2 Mr Greco will have none of it. "The fact that we are strong in Italy, is this a sin? Is this a mistake? Is this something I have to feel regretful about? I don't think it is," he snaps, showing an exasperation shared by many of Italy's executives about the perception of the country internationally. "This is one of the top 10 countries in the world by GDP. We make profits in Italy, we have high market share, Italy is growing," he says.\par \par \uc2 Another exhalation of frustration greets a suggestion that Generali might provide credit to small and midsized businesses, since traditional bank lending has shrivelled during the downturn.\par \par \uc2 "Never, never," he says of the popular idea among lawmakers that insurers such as Generali could disintermediate banks. "I have been very clear with everyone at a European level and a national level. We can't help . . . It is not that we don't want to . . . We cannot do things that we do not have the competence to do," he says, his foot still urgently tapping out its staccato beat on the floor.\par \par \uc2 Like most of Italy's new corporate class, Mr Greco was a supporter of 40-year-old reformist prime minister \uc2 Matteo Renzi\uc2  when he came to power 18 months ago. With his combative attitude, Mr Renzi was their political counterpart. Since then, business leaders' affection has cooled as deep reforms have failed to materialise and the government growth target of 0.7 per cent this year is starting to look a stretch.\par \par \uc2 "We need much more reform as Europeans, and we need much more as Italians," is all Mr Greco will say.\par \par \uc2 But he stresses that he wants to applaud Mr Renzi and his team for the ef-forts they have made to ask Italy's corporate leaders how they can support them internationally, such as through trade missions.\par \par \uc2 That this is a great step forward reflects as much as anything how broken Italy's corporate system had become during 20 years of economic stagnation under its discredited political class of the right and left.\par \par \uc2 "The government is acting in a way where you can see that they are trying to help companies like ourselves. I feel that we are starting to have the support of the country," Mr Greco says. "This is a simple thing but important. You feel you belong to a place."\par \par \uc2 CV\par \par \uc2 Born June 1959, Naples, Italy\par \par \uc2 Education BA in economics, \uc2 University of Rome La Sapienza\uc2 ; MA in international economics and monetary theory, University of Rochester, New York\par \par \uc2 Career\par \par \uc2 1986: Joins McKinsey; becomes partner in 1992 and leader of its Italian insurance practice\par \par \uc2 1995: Joins RAS, rising to CEO within five years\par \par \uc2 2005: Appointed CEO of EurizonVita division of Sanpaolo IMI banking group and CEO of Eurizon Financial Group\par \par \uc2 2007: Joins \uc2 Zurich Financial Services\uc2  as deputy CEO of Global Life; 2008, becomes CEO and joins executive committee; 2010, becomes CEO of general insurance in \uc2 Zurich Insurance\par \par \uc2 August 2012: Named CEO of Generali\par \par \uc2 Interests Road cycling\par \par \uc2 Second opinion\par \par \uc2 The cycling buddy\par \par \uc2 Mario Greco sat on the board of media group L'Espresso, owned by the CIR conglomerate, before quitting two years ago to work on the turnround of Generali. \uc2 Rodolfo De Benedetti\uc2  , Chairman of CIR, who has remained a cycling buddy of Mr Greco, says: "Mario is one of the Italian managers who best represents our country in the financial community.

The transaction would be the biggest private equity buyout to take place in South Korea.\par \par \uc2 "They are likely to sign the deal soon," the person said, but added that "details of the contract could still change" as they were still being finalised.\par \par \uc2 Tesco\uc2  had reportedly sought a price of more than $7bn. It has drawn strong interest from buyout groups as it involves a rare, large-size target.\par \par \uc2 MBK, South Korea's biggest private equity fund, fought off competition in the form of a joint bid from US buyout group \uc2 KKR\uc2  and Hong Kong-based \uc2 Affinity Equity Partners\uc2 , as well as from \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2  of the US.\par \par \uc2 With the deal, the MBK-led group would gain entry to South Korea's highly competitive retail sector. Homeplus is the country's second-largest discount store chain, after Shinsegae's E-Mart, generating annual revenues of more than $7bn from more than 900 outlets.\par \par \uc2 Tesco\uc2  is selling Homeplus , the South Korean business once regarded as the jewel in the crown of its international operations, to bolster its balance sheet following profit warnings and \u163\'00\'A37bn in writedowns this year.\par \par \uc2 The sale of its biggest overseas division will help the UK-based retailer pay off part of debts that total about \u163\'00\'A321.7bn. \uc2 Tesco\uc2  is also seeking to sell its Dunnhumby \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business , which is valued at up to \u163\'00\'A32bn.\par \par \uc2 Tesco\uc2 's other international businesses include more than 1,700 stores in Thailand, a business in Malaysia and a presence across central and eastern Europe.\par \par \uc2 The South Korean market has been especially difficult for big-box retailers because of legislation restricting where they can open outlets and requiring supermarkets to close every other Sunday to help smaller grocers compete.\par \par \uc2 There are also signs of increasing strain in the South Korean economy amid sluggish domestic consumption. Homeplus reported a Won300bn ($254m) net loss in the financial year that ended February 28, reversing from a Won463bn profit a year earlier, as revenues fell 4 per cent to Won8.6tn.\par \par \uc2 "It is still an attractive deal for the buyer despite such difficulties. MBK seems to think there is still room to boost the value of Homeplus after acquisition," said an investment banker.\par \par \uc2 MBK is an Asia-focused private equity group set up in 2005 by former Carlyle managers, with about $8.1bn in assets under management.\par \par \uc2 Tesco\uc2  was the only competitive foreign retailer in South Korea, gaining traction due to a policy of localisation, while rivals \uc2 Walmart\uc2  and Carrefour pulled out of the country after years of losses. It entered South Korea in 1999 in a joint venture with \uc2 Samsung Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 See Lex\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150903eb930000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

The group could total nearly 1 million members, a scale it believes would have unprecedented leverage in negotiating directly with hospitals, drug companies and others.\par \par \uc2 Assuming the idea even gets off the ground, it could take one to two years to set up and longer to generate significant savings, health-care experts said.\par \par \uc2 Ford Motor Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\uc2  and \uc2 General Motors Co\uc2 . largely rely now on health insurers to negotiate deals with hospitals, doctors and other medical providers for their workers' and white-collar retirees' plans. A separate UAW-affiliated trust fund manages health care expenses and benefits for about 750,000 hourly retirees and their dependents.\par \par \uc2 UAW President \uc2 Dennis Williams\uc2  previously has described the plan as a way for auto makers to gain more control over health-care expenses and win cost savings. He wants the purchasing group overseen by a board of union and auto industry executives. A prior effort to pull together employees of the three stalled in 2011 because auto makers weren't interested in pursuing it.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear how insurers like \uc2 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan\uc2  -- which handles much of the Detroit auto makers' health care business -- would fit into this new model. \uc2 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 A Ford spokesman said even if it were to negotiate directly with providers "we still need a benefits administrator" due to the complexity of claims, suggesting a role for \uc2 Blue Cross\uc2  Blue Shield would remain.\par \par \uc2 GM\uc2  and \uc2 Fiat\uc2  Chrysler each said they would be open to discussing ways to reduce the rising costs of employee medical care, but declined to comment specifically on the idea.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 UAW\uc2  declined to make Mr. Williams available for an interview.\par \par \uc2 The union official is leading contract negotiations with the auto makers on a new, four-year deal to replace a contract expiring this month.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say the health-care proposal would be a way to free up savings for a wage increase.\par \par \uc2 Detroit car companies spend more than $2 billion annually on medical care for factory workers and dependents. Mr. Williams has said the purchasing group could include the auto maker's 90,000 white collar workers and their dependents. The UAW-affiliated health care trusts have a combined $61 billion in assets.\par \par \uc2 UAW\uc2  members at the U.S. car makers typically pay between 6% and 8% of their medical costs, compared with the 28% of costs paid by the average U.S. manufacturing worker, according to researcher \uc2 Truven Health \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Auto makers have said their employee health-care costs are rising at an unsustainable rate and could creep higher with a federal tax on benefit-rich plans beginning in 2018.\par \par \uc2 Union officials are reluctant to agree to shift more of the cost burden to workers, according to people familiar with negotiations. The union has a record of suggesting ways to maintain generous medical benefits while offering cost-effective strategies to auto makers.\par \par \uc2 In 2005, as the domestic auto makers lost market share and faced rising costs for current and retired workers, then-UAW President \uc2 Ron Gettelfinger\uc2  proposed setting up trusts known as voluntary employee beneficiary associations, or VEBAs, to take billions of dollars of retiree health-care costs off the car companies' books.\par \par \uc2 That proposal was adopted in 2007 as financial losses mounted at the auto makers, and the shift led to a significant decline in the auto makers' annual labor costs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Williams, a VEBA trustee, has a keen view on how the retiree plans has operated. Since they were established in 2010, the trusts have managed to expand benefits and restore full vision and dental coverage for retirees while keeping annual cost-growth in the low single digits, said industry experts.\par \par \uc2 Health spending growth in the U.S. has generally been muted in recent years, running at around 4% annually, a slowdown that some economists have attributed to the recession and its after-effects.\par \par \uc2 Under his plan, Mr. Williams has said the car makers and the retiree trusts would continue to fund their health benefits separately. In addition to joint negotiating with health-care providers, the group would look for ways to manage costs and quality of care more efficiently.\par \par \uc2 One option for the purchasing pool, say people familiar with the matter, would be for it to establish "centers of excellence," a model in which employers contract with a few highly-rated medical centers for better rates on procedures such as knee surgery.\par \par \uc2 Companies including \uc2 Boeing Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Lowe's Cos\uc2 . have such setups, which typically supplement traditional health plans\par \par \uc2 Lowe's\uc2  has a deal with the \uc2 Cleveland Clinic\uc2  and flies employees to Ohio for heart surgeries at no cost to the worker.\par \par \uc2 The savings from direct deals between employers and health-care providers can be substantial, with some arrangements producing cost-reductions of between 10% and 20% compared with traditional coverage plans, said Erin Tatar, national leader at \uc2 Towers Watson & Co\uc2 .'s health management practice.\par \par \uc2 Employers often work with third parties to facilitate their deals with health-care providers -- including insurers that administer traditional health benefits, as well as outside operators.\par \par \uc2 The idea of employers striking deals directly with hospitals, doctors and other medical providers has gained attention lately as companies seek to trim costs and better control quality.

In a strongly worded rebuke to its rival on Tuesday, BATS Chief Executive \uc2 Chris Concannon\uc2  said that \uc2 NYSE\uc2  Group's process for opening trading on stocks listed at the exchange was "broken" and that major changes needed to be made to protect investors from future problems.\par \par \uc2 "No one on the planet operates that way, and no one should operate that way," he said in an interview, adding that he sees "very limited value" in the use of humans on the trading floor. BATS operates entirely electronic exchanges.\par \par \uc2 An NYSE spokeswoman said in a statement that its "time-tested model for opening stocks with a blend of human oversight and sophisticated technology results in less volatile opens and enhanced price discovery, in particular for important days such as IPOs and during extreme market volatility."\par \par \uc2 The prospect of continued volatility is driving concerns from investors, exchanges and trading firms to avoid disruptions in the markets. Exchanges are also fierce competitors and have been known to use their rivals' problems to advance their own market models.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Concannon's comments touched on the long-running discussion among market participants about the \uc2 NYSE\uc2 's historic trading floor at its headquarters on Wall Street, where floor-based traders handle the opening and closing of stocks and seek to buffer the market during times of volatility.\par \par \uc2 NYSE\uc2  officials and floor brokers have argued for years that they serve a crucial role providing slower trading within today's high-speed, electronic markets.\par \par \uc2 But there have been persistent questions about whether Intercontinental Exchange, which bought the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  in 2013, will keep the floor open. Critics have complained that, in today's overwhelmingly electronic market, its usefulness is primarily as backdrop for televised stock reports. Intercontinental Exchange has said it has no plans to do away with the trading floor.\par \par \uc2 "The debate is about whether we need a slower market structure or a faster market structure on days with large systemic volatility," said David Weisberger, managing director at market-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm RegOne Solutions. The slower version is driven largely by people, whereas the faster one is controlled by computers and trading algorithms, he added.\par \par \uc2 The NYSE spokeswoman defended the exchange's approach by contrasting it with a notable failure a rival experienced with its own initial public offering.\par \par \uc2 "As BATS experienced with its IPO, relying exclusively on technology for opening stocks and IPOs can have disastrous consequences," she said, referring to BATS' decision to cancel its IPO in 2012 because of a glitch in its trading system.\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 24, in particular, trading problems exposed flaws in the market architecture, many analysts said. Amid unease over China's economy and the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's timeline for raising interest rates, a huge wave of sell orders hit the markets in the morning.\par \par \uc2 NYSE\uc2  invoked the rarely used Rule 48 to allow market-makers to forgo disseminating information about how potentially volatile stocks might trade. The rule was designed to make it easier to open the markets faster, but many stocks ended up opening late.\par \par \uc2 That led to other issues. Many exchange-traded funds fell sharply because the underlying stocks hadn't yet begun trading, making it difficult for market-makers to accurately price ETFs that included those shares. Elsewhere, the prices for some stocks, including blue chips \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 . and \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., plummeted more than 20%, adding a drag on ETFs linked to them. The many price swings triggered nearly 1,300 halts of stocks and ETFs, and many shares didn't formally open for trading until 9:45 a.m. or, in some cases, after 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, \uc2 Nasdaq OMX Group\uc2  Inc. opened stocks listed on its exchange "within one second," according to \uc2 Nelson Griggs\uc2 , head of listings at \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 . NYSE-listed stocks also started trading on \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  and BATS despite the fact that they hadn't opened on the \uc2 NYSE\uc2 . Because order books were thinner at BATS and \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  than at the home exchange, traders say that contributed to price swings.\par \par \uc2 The confusion prompted dozens of listed companies to call \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  to find out what was happening, Mr. Griggs said.\par \par \uc2 "What the market and issuers crave is certainty," he said. "There was a clear dearth of information. We had an enormous amount of calls coming in from people trying to figure out what was happening."\par \par \uc2 Several market observers pointed to the trading of shares of the private-equity firm \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . as an example of how things went awry. Shares opened at $10 on Aug. 24, roughly 50% below the closing price the Friday before, despite there being no significant news about the company. They traded as low as $8 before rebounding to $18.69 at the end of the day.\par \par \uc2 "That was a sign that something really went wrong," said Andrew Brooks, vice president and head of U.S. equity trading at \uc2 T. Rowe Price\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Another factor slowing the start of trading, apart from Rule 48, were trading constraints that forced an unusually large number of \uc2 NYSE\uc2  stocks to be opened manually by traders on the exchange floor, said John McCarthy, general counsel at brokerage firm \uc2 KCG Holdings Inc\uc2 . Stocks on other exchanges, such as the \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 , opened electronically without issue, he said.\par \par \uc2 When a stock opens manually, floor traders pair off buy and sell orders before kicking off trading at an agreed-upon price. In an electronic open, trading begins right away and orders are matched electronically.\par \par \uc2 "There's fewer specialists on the floor than there used to be, and they literally have to work through these stocks," Mr. McCarthy said. "They're just doing what the computer would do otherwise."\par \par \uc2 On a normal day, about three-quarters of the stocks that KCG opens from the floor of the exchange are handled electronically and the rest are opened manually using floor personnel, Mr. McCarthy said. But because of the volatility on Aug. 24, it was the reverse.\par \par \uc2 "On a day like Monday, it created what I would argue was a delay that wasn't beneficial for the market in a kind of extreme environment," he said.\par \par \uc2 As for Rule 48, several floor brokers said they believed the \uc2 NYSE\uc2  should consider phasing out its use or invoking it less frequently. "I understand why it was created, but there has to be a better way to handle the open on volatile days," said Peter Costa, a floor trader and president of Empire Executions Inc.\par \par \uc2 Ted Weisberg\uc2 , a longtime floor trader and founder of floor brokerage \uc2 Seaport Securities Corp\uc2 ., said invoking Rule 48 can speed up the opening of stocks but leads to less transparency.\par \par \uc2 "When you invoke Rule 48, you've opted for speed over price discovery and speed over transparency," he said. "'What's in the public's best interest is transparency and time to react."\par \par \uc2 An NYSE spokeswoman said: "Rule 48 allows us to expedite the opening of stocks on volatile days while maintaining the hallmark transparency that we are known for."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20150903000027"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020150903eb930000p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Now known as the Westin Bayshore, the hotel was put on the block early this year by owner \uc2 Starwood Capital Group\uc2  and is nearing a sale for roughly C$270 million ($205 million) to C$290 million, dwarfing initial estimates, according to people familiar with the deal.\par \par \uc2 The big questions: Who is going to buy it, and why would anyone pay that much for the 511-room waterfront parcel? The expected price will be one of the highest ever for a Canadian hotel, on a price-per-room basis.\par \par \uc2 Still, there has been no shortage of prospective buyers. Six approached the city to explore redevelopment options, according to Brian Jackson, Vancouver's director of planning. A couple of dozen parties expressed interest to listing agent \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield Inc\uc2 ., with a large overseas contingent, mostly from China. The deal with Starwood is expected to close this year, according to people familiar with the matter\par \par \uc2 One high-profile bidder: Concord Pacific Developments Inc., which reshaped Vancouver's downtown skyline in the early 1990s, redeveloping Expo 86, the old World's Fair site, into a 2.5-mile long, multitower condo community that houses thousands of new arrivals from China and Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 Concord Pacific confirmed it bid on the Bayshore but declined to comment further.\par \par \uc2 Many expect the buyer will try to develop condominiums on the site, reflecting the intense demand for homes in the area and the quick pace of price increases.\par \par \uc2 But obstacles abound. For starters, it will be tough for a developer to shoehorn more luxury towers into densely packed Coal Harbour, a high-rise condo district and one of Canada's most coveted addresses.\par \par \uc2 "We've had a number of inquiries from people who wanted to tear down the hotel and replace it with more height, more density, more residential," said Mr. Jackson. "To all of that, we said, 'No.'"\par \par \uc2 The risks over the pending deal are similar to those in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston and other North American cities with hot condo markets.\par \par \uc2 Developers are paying up for prime sites with visions of enormous condo projects, but they are making a bet they will be able to overcome local opposition that inevitably materializes.\par \par \uc2 Luxury condos, mostly on or near the waterfront, peaked prerecession in the C$1,800 to C$2,000 range before falling to around C$1,500 to C$1,600, said Michael Ferreira, a principal at Urban \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which researches mixed-use projects.\par \par \uc2 Prices started skyrocketing again by 2014, and if the Bayshore were rezoned, the average sale price could easily hit C$2,500 a square foot and possibly rise to C$3,000 or even more, Mr. Ferreira said.\par \par \uc2 The property includes the original 11-story Bayshore Inn, built in 1961, the 18-story 1970 hotel, and a newer, 60,000-square-foot conference center. Mr. Hughes holed up in the hotel penthouse, and the mystery of why he came, what he did and why he left remains a puzzle to a generation of Vancouverites.\par \par \uc2 Starwood bought the hotel with partners in 2005, paying $96.5 million, according to real-estate tracker \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . By 2013, the value was pegged at $146.2 million\par \par \uc2 The biggest hurdle facing buyers interested in redeveloping the property is the zoning of the 6-acre site since 1991. City officials say it is "shrink-wrapped and bubble-wrapped" to preserve the existing hotel precinct and curb the scale of redevelopment.\par \par \uc2 Opposition also is likely from the hotel's unionized workforce and affluent Coal Harbour residents whose water views could be jeopardized.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150902000029"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150902eb920000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Until now, the biggest mystery hanging over Vancouver's world-renown Bayshore Inn has been the six-month stay there in 1972 by billionaire recluse Howard Hughes, who sparked a media siege featuring a failed attempt to take his picture from a passing hang-glider.\par \par \uc2 Today there is a different type of mystery unfolding at the prime downtown property, the real estate kind. Now known as the Westin Bayshore, the hotel was put on the block early this year by owner \uc2 Starwood Capital Group\uc2  and is nearing a sale for roughly C$270 million ($205 million) to C$290 million, dwarfing initial estimates, according to people familiar with the deal.\par \par \uc2 The big questions: who's going to buy it and why would anyone pay that much for the 511-room waterfront parcel? The expected price tag will be one of the highest ever paid for a Canadian hotel, on a price per room basis.\par \par \uc2 Still, there has been no shortage of prospective buyers. Six approached the city to explore redevelopment options, according to Brian Jackson, Vancouver's director of planning. A couple of dozen parties expressed interest to listing agent \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield Inc\uc2 ., with a large overseas contingent, mostly from China. The deal with Starwood is expected to close this calendar year, according to people familiar with the matter\par \par \uc2 One high-profile bidder: Concord Pacific Developments Inc., which reshaped Vancouver's downtown skyline in the early 1990s, redeveloping Expo 86, the old World's Fair site, into a 2.5-mile long, multi-tower condo community that houses thousands of new arrivals from China and Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 Concord Pacific confirmed it bid on the Bayshore, but declined other comment.\par \par \uc2 Many expect the buyer will try to develop condominiums on the site, reflecting the intense demand for homes in the area and the dizzying pace of price increases.\par \par \uc2 But obstacles abound. For starters, it will be tough for a developer to shoehorn more luxury towers into densely packed Coal Harbour, a high-rise condo district and one of Canada's most coveted addresses.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe've had a number of inquiries from people who wanted to tear down the hotel and replace it with more height, more density, more residential," said Mr. Jackson. \u8220\'20\'1CTo all of that, we said, \u8216\'20\'18No.'"\par \par \uc2 The risks over the pending deal are similar to those being played out in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Boston and other North American cities with hot condo markets. Developers are paying up for prime sites with visions of enormous condo projects, but they're making a bet they'll be able to overcome local opposition that inevitably materializes.\par \par \uc2 In Vancouver, condo prices have been soaring thanks to strong demand mostly from Chinese buyers and younger Canadians.\par \par \uc2 High-end luxury condos, mostly on or near the waterfront, peaked prerecession in the C$1,800 to C$2,000 range before falling back to earth post-downturn to around C$1,500 to C$1,600, said Michael Ferreira, a principal at Urban \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which researches mixed-use projects.\par \par \uc2 Prices started skyrocketing again by 2014, and if the Bayshore were rezoned, the average sale price could easily hit C$2,500 a square foot and possibly rise to C$3,000 or even more, Mr. Ferreira said.\par \par \uc2 The property includes the original 11-story Bayshore Inn, built in 1961; the 18-story 1970 hotel, and a newer 60,000 square-foot conference center. Mr. Hughes holed up in the hotel penthouse, and the mystery of why he came, what he did and why he left remains a puzzle to a generation of Vancouverites.\par \par \uc2 Starwood bought the hotel with partners in 2005, paying $96.5 million, according to real estate tracker \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . By 2013, the value was pegged at $146.2 million\par \par \uc2 The biggest hurdle facing buyers interested in redeveloping the property is the zoning of the 6-acre site since 1991. City officials say it is \u8220\'20\'1Cshrink-wrapped and bubble-wrapped" to preserve the existing hotel precinct and curb the scale of redevelopment.\par \par \uc2 Opposition also is likely from the hotel's unionized workforce and affluent Coal Harbour residents whose water views could be jeopardized. And the 1961 mid-rise tower is a candidate for heritage status, a landmark designation, complicating any bid to scrap it.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf we lose the Bayshore and Howard Hughes' suite, it would be death by a thousand cuts," said Aaron Chapman, a local historian who has conducted hotel tours.\par \par \uc2 Some developers took a pass on the bidding including high-end property developer \uc2 Grosvenor Americas\uc2 , which is building Grosvenor Ambleside in West Vancouver and has priced penthouse units at close to C$4,000 a foot.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COperating a hotel for a number of years is not what we do," said Michael Ward, general manager for Grosvenor in Vancouver.\par \par \uc2 A full-blown rezoning could take two to five years and be fraught with delays and opposition. \u8220\'20\'1CYou'd have to achieve among the highest level condo prices Vancouver has ever seen to make the numbers work," Mr. Ward said.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150901eb91002pb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc53}{\*\bkmkend toc53}\b \uc2 Heard on the Street / Financial Analysis and Commentary\b0\par\par\uc2 1,797 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 September 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Europe\par \uc2 WSJE\par 28\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   \par \par \uc2 ECB: Don't Ease to Appease\par \par \uc2 A central bank's work is never done, it seems. Last week's market swings have led to building expectations that the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  will boost its 1 trillion euro stimulus program. But this week's monetary-policy meeting looks unlikely to deliver that.\par \par \uc2 The ECB\uc2  has a tricky situation on its hands. A truly convincing and robust eurozone recovery is still a thing of hope rather than reality. Expectations for global growth have fallen due to fears of a slowdown in China and other emerging nations. Market measures of inflation expectations have taken a drubbing again due to falling oil prices. And the euro -- probably the single most important channel for propping up eurozone growth and inflation -- has strengthened.\par \par \uc2 But there still are good reasons for \uc2 the ECB\uc2  to wait and see what happens. First, the economic data so far has suggested that the eurozone economy is proving resilient, with domestic demand playing an important role. Monetary data released last week showed an impressive 12.1% year on year rise in the so-called M1 aggregate, which measures currency in circulation and overnight deposits and which tends to be a good leading signal for growth. Sentiment surveys have remained robust, despite the shocks of recent months.\par \par \uc2 Second, events elsewhere will matter. \uc2 The ECB\uc2  would get more bang for its policy buck if it were to ease once the \uc2 U.S. Federal Reserve\uc2  has started raising interest rates. That would probably lead to a weaker euro than otherwise. \uc2 The ECB\uc2  has been frustrated in the past by twists and turns in Fed policy; the outcome of September's U.S. rate decision is clearly uncertain.\par \par \uc2 Third, August's market panic may turn out to be just that: a panic. ECB President \uc2 Mario Draghi\uc2  declined to pander to jittery markets in June when German bunds sold off sharply, saying the central bank wouldn't tame volatility. Markets have become excessively dependent on central bankers and are too quick now to call for support; to ride to the rescue when it isn't clearly necessary would simply embed that unhealthy reliance even more deeply.\par \par \uc2 Finally, there is still a year to go on \uc2 the ECB\uc2 's current program. Mr. Draghi may well reinforce that \uc2 the ECB\uc2 's purchases are flexible and will respond to changing circumstances. But he needn't -- and shouldn't -- overhaul the plan just yet.\par \par \uc2 -- Richard Barley\par \par \uc2 Is comScore's Revenue Growth That Strong?\par \par \uc2 Growth-starved investors have rewarded companies that can increase revenues. But investors should dig into what is driving their growth.\par \par \uc2 Internet \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company comScore is an example. It reported second-quarter revenue of $91.4 million on Aug. 4, up 14% from a year earlier. A note within its quarterly filing explained, though, that $10.8 million was "nonmonetary" revenue. Exclude that, and comScore's revenue would have grown only 3%.\par \par \uc2 Nonmonetary revenue is financialspeak to say comScore booked revenue from barter agreements where actual cash wouldn't be changing hands. In this case, it was for the exchange of data with other companies.\par \par \uc2 ComScore appears to have been acting in accordance with the relevant accounting standards in its approach. These let companies record nonmonetary transactions with "commercial substance" at the estimated fair value of the assets surrendered.\par \par \uc2 Even so, the significance of these nonmonetary revenues to the company's top line warrants scrutiny. Growth in revenue from bartering accounted for the majority of comScore's sales growth in the most recent quarter.\par \par \uc2 What's more, the gains are based on estimates of the assets' fair value; that is subjective by nature and has been open to question in the past in other industries, namely banking. A further wrinkle: About 20% of the nonmonetary revenue in the second quarter came via a related-party transaction. ComScore didn't identify the company.\par \par \uc2 The issue of nonmonetary revenue has piqued investors' interest. At an Aug. 12 investor conference hosted by Oppenheimer, comScore finance chief \uc2 Mel Wesley\uc2  responded to an analyst's question about bartering. The company uses data-sharing agreements to get access to data sets owned by others that it deems necessary for developing products, Mr. Wesley said.\par \par \uc2 These arrangements allow it to avoid having to pay for the data or enter into revenue-sharing agreements. And comScore determines how much revenue to book based on the average historical cash sales of the same product. That seems like an appropriate approach to fair-valuing the asset, but investors don't know much beyond that about the company's method.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wesley added that comScore doesn't often do such deals. But its filings show nonmonetary revenue has ramped up significantly over the past 12 months. It accounted for about 8% of comScore's total revenue over the period, versus only 2% in the previous 12 months.\par \par \uc2 ComScore's stock, meanwhile, reached a 52-week high last month, closing at $64.64 on Aug. 17. It has fallen a bit since then but is still up about 40% from a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Granted, comScore released the mobile version of its validated Campaign Essentials (vCE) product for advertising \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the spring, and its Xmedia tool for measuring audiences across TV and digital media is now in beta. It stands to reason the company would have greater need for the swapped data sets in the quarters leading up to these product launches.\par \par \uc2 And while comScore has reported an annual net loss for the past five years, some analysts value it on the basis of free-cash flow, which would be unaffected by nonmonetary sales. Free-cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capital lease payments, rose 63% in the first half of 2015 and more than doubled in the second quarter.\par \par \uc2 Still, this doesn't change the fact that much of the company's reported top-line growth has come from revenue that brings no cash in the door. And, while comScore backs out noncash expenses such as stock-based compensation in its adjusted earnings calculations, it doesn't back out noncash revenue.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the transactions raise eyebrows among accounting specialists. "If nothing else, it makes the revenue growth suspect," said Charles Mulford, a professor of accounting at Georgia Tech's Scheller College of Business. "They're adhering to the letter of commercial substance. But an investor should ask: Does it capture the economic substance?"\par \par \uc2 A company swapping data with another company wouldn't see any benefit to future cash flows -- a measure of commercial substance -- unless it can go out and resell the data, Mr. Mulford said.\par \par \uc2 That remains something of an open question for comScore. It says its vCE business, of which vCE Mobile is a part, already accounts for about 10% of revenue and is expected to contribute $100 million in annual revenue by 2017. Xmedia has yet to fully launch, though, so the bulk of its cash flows are hypothetical.\par \par \uc2 Investors have reason to be wary of nonmonetary revenue, says J. Edward Ketz, a professor of accounting at \uc2 Penn State University\uc2 . Standard setters didn't go far enough in modifying accounting rules after Internet companies swapping fiber-optic capacity ran into trouble with their accounting early in the last decade, he argues.\par \par \uc2 Investors cheering comScore's top-line growth should take closer note of where it is coming from.\par \par \uc2 -- Miriam Gottfried\par \par \uc2 Buffett's\par \par \uc2 Buy Into\par \par \uc2 Phillips\par \par \uc2 Gushes\par \par \uc2 Maybe \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2  will start calling it Phillips 132.\par \par \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway\uc2  has come back for seconds at \uc2 Phillips 66\uc2 , disclosing a nearly 11% stake in the energy company after Friday's close.\par \par \uc2 Oil prices were near their all-time peak back in 2008, when Mr. Buffett first bought into \uc2 ConocoPhillips\uc2 , then an integrated oil and gas company. He later admitted to "terrible timing" with that investment and used it as currency in a shares-for-assets swap with wholly owned Berkshire unit \uc2 Lubrizol\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To the untrained eye, Mr. Buffett's new commitment to \uc2 Phillips 66\uc2  -- a 2012 spinoff from \uc2 ConocoPhillips\uc2 , owning its downstream units -- might look like another instance of buying at the top. After all, a confluence of factors such as wide spreads between U.S. crude and refined-products prices on global markets have made the past several quarters some of the most profitable ever for U.S. refiners.\par \par \uc2 An equal-weighted basket of stocks in the industry has beaten the \uc2 S&P 500\uc2  by 22 percentage points so far this year. But a buildup of fuel inventories could squeeze profits when the summer driving season ends in September.\par \par \uc2 Take a closer look, though. Many nonrefining businesses within \uc2 Phillips 66\uc2 , such as its midstream unit, are substantial and stand to benefit if currently beaten-down oil and natural-gas prices rebound. That business is absorbing the lion's share of capital expenditure -- a contrarian move worthy of Mr. Buffett himself. In fact, he is making his own big bet on energy infrastructure. In 2014, \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway Energy\uc2  absorbed 43% of all capital expenditure at the conglomerate.\par \par \uc2 Clearly then, \uc2 Phillips 66\uc2 , with its valuable assets outside of red-hot refining, is a company making the sorts of investments that Mr. Buffett values, and in the types of assets he covets. Berkshire's stake is too large to be a simple portfolio move and instead smacks of a strategic step.\par \par \uc2 It could be a precursor to yet another swap, perhaps for assets complementary to Berkshire's existing infrastructure. Rather than the refining units that are all the rage, Mr. Buffett would be more likely to target units suffering from low petroleum prices, or pipelines that offer steady, utility-like returns.\par \par \uc2 He didn't get the nickname the \uc2 Oracle\uc2  of Omaha by buying at the top of the market.\par \par \uc2 -- Spencer Jakab\par \par \uc2 Overheard\par \par \uc2 It has been a bad year for Asian businesses evocative of James Clavell's "Noble House."\par \par \uc2 That 1981 best seller was the story of Hong Kong's largest conglomerate suffering financial trouble and intrigue. So investors fond of Clavell's fiction may want to follow the facts regarding \uc2 Noble House (China) \uc2 Holdings, a small, Hong Kong-listed restaurant business that the local regulator warned Friday had too few shareholders holding 91% of the stock. Though the regulator didn't say as much, such concentration warnings could suggest the stock isn't moving up and down according to market forces. Then there's Noble Group, the Hong Kong-based but Singapore-listed commodities trader whose accounting has been under scrutiny since February and whose credit is now in trouble.\par \par \uc2 Considering the original "Noble House" was all about a conglomerate's struggle to survive -- it succeeds at the end -- Clavell lovers will surely want to tune in.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20150901000020"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020150901eb910000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY\par {\*\bkmkstart toc54}{\*\bkmkend toc54}\b \uc2 Arch-traditionalist private banks go mobile\b0\par\par\uc2 By Hugo Greenhalgh   \par \uc2 1,243 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 August 2015\par \uc2 Financial Times\par \uc2 FTFT\par \uc2 London Ed1\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 Technology for customers is a 'work in progress'\par \par \uc2 Private banks are known for centuries of tradition: advice given to generations who have filed into the same oak-panelled office. Service was paramount: the customer always came first.\par \par \uc2 But now the model is shifting. Service still rules, of course, but many private banks operating in the UK, including \uc2 C. Hoare & Co\uc2  and those managed by Kleinwort Benson and \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  are all poised to launch new web- or mobile-based apps for their wealthy clients.\par \par \uc2 "More than 80 per cent of our transactions are being done through the internet," says \uc2 Alexander Hoare\uc2 , managing partner of C. Hoare, which, founded in 1672, is the UK's oldest independent bank.\par \par \uc2 Hoare is set to launch its mobile banking app in the first quarter of next year, and is not alone in introducing new ways of banking.\par \par \uc2 "Technology and the way that people will relate to their banks is potentially a threat," says Roger Weatherby, chief executive of Weatherbys Bank, "but it is also an opportunity. It places smaller banks potentially on a level playing field with the other larger banks."\par \par \uc2 But it has been many years coming. Customers of UK retail banks have been able to access their accounts through mobile apps for several years. So why the delay?\par \par \uc2 "[The greater adoption of technology] is a work in progress," says \uc2 Sebastian Dovey\uc2 , managing partner of \uc2 Scorpio Partnership\uc2 , the consultancy. "I'm sure that the industry looks at technology almost aghast in terms of how it might reduce the need for advice. The thought is that, if you give them everything on app, they'll run off and never use an adviser again."\par \par \uc2 For Christian Nolterieke, managing director of MyPrivateBanking Research, the banks are concerned about not putting a foot wrong. "Their clients are of the utmost importance," he says. "And because of this, they are still trying to figure out how to approach them best. These are banks who know they have to do it, but are slow because they want to do it right."\par \par \uc2 And the market is vast. \uc2 Scorpio Partnership\uc2  estimates the global private banking at approximately $20.6tn, with potential advisable assets - those that could be banked, but are currently not - at $37.6tn. Part of the banks' move stems from simply not wanting to be left behind by the marketplace, but it is also recognition of the shifting demographic of the newly rich: the wealthy are becoming younger and more web savvy.\par \par \uc2 Citi Private Bank, which focuses exclusively on wealthy individuals or families with more than $25m, launched a digital service called In View, offering "clients a comprehensive snapshot of their wealth in one place, giving bankers and clients a world of data at their fingertips", according to its website. We spent a lot of time really looking at what was going on in financial services, but also holistically at how digital was changing the world," explains Tim Tate, head of digital strategy at Citi Private Bank. In practice, the service gives clients the same level of access to the data as the bankers themselves.\par \par \uc2 "They can manipulate that data in many ways, changing the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . With paper reporting you only get one view - and that is the view that the banker has designed for you.\par \par \uc2 "Now they have a platform that allows them to define their own view of their portfolio as they want to see it, and which benchmark they want to use. It puts the power in the hands of the client."\par \par \uc2 To an extent, this is antithetical to the traditional private banking model, in that there is no physical face-to-face contact and the client is able to do everything they want themselves - something Mr Tate readily acknowledges.\par \par \uc2 "The important thing is, we're not trying to force everyone to do everything themselves," he says. "Some people absolutely want a digital model, some want a hybrid and some want an analogue model. Those who don't want to do everything themselves can still receive their traditional private banking services."\par \par \uc2 James Fleming\uc2 , chief executive of \uc2 Arbuthnot Latham\uc2 , agrees - but with qualifications. For him, technology is a "tremendous enabler but no substitute for human interaction". He continues: "I meet a lot of clients day in and day out, and the answer that they give me is that they are looking for a personal relationship on a long-term basis.\par \par \uc2 "But technology is a given; it has to be in place. You have to have mobile banking and the ability to see investment portfolios, for example, but I don't see them as a substitute."\par \par \uc2 Yet others suggest that the more traditional private banking model is under threat - and needs to change. Paul Kearney is managing director and head of the private investment office at Kleinwort Benson, which is currently developing a mobile-based web app for its private banking clients.\par \par \uc2 "We have been working on the threats to our current model and the traditional relationship, which is very much face to face and how you meet and face clients. We are very strongly of the view that the model is going to be under huge threat. Future generations are not going to expect face to face as a normal model of doing business."\par \par \uc2 If existing players do not give private banking clients the digital services they want, new entrants could fill the gap.\par \par \uc2 "There are opportunities for challenger banks," Mr Weatherby adds. "But there is plenty to go round. Depending on which survey you look at, there are about a million people who would be classified as high net worth or ultra-high net worth - and would essentially come into our bracket of \u163\'00\'A33m of net assets. But I can't sit here and promise to give everyone a fantastic service; we would only really be able to offer that to less than 20,000 customers.\par \par \uc2 "At the moment, we have in the region of 4,000 customers, so there's good room to grow - and still 980,000 left over for the rest."\par \par \uc2 Apps and platforms\par \par \uc2 Younger customers drive digital change\par \par \uc2 Private banks have to adapt to a new generation of customers or face missing out, says Philip Harris, chief executive of Credit Suisse's UK private bank.\par \par \uc2 He says it is rolling out a "digital private bank" in Europe and the UK at some point in 2016 "in recognition that clients want to interact with their wealth, and institutions that don't allow that or facilitate that in a way that is sustainable will fail. It is a recognition that this is the way the market is going and we want to be in the vanguard."\par \par \uc2 In the UK, 91 per cent of affluent consumers use mobile websites for financial matters, and two-thirds use mobile apps provided by their bank or wealth manager, according to the global survey of mobile disruption in wealth management.\par \par \uc2 Kleinwort Benson is also developing a mobile app with younger customers in mind. "We are looking towards those who are currently in their teens and early 20s - the next generation of entrepreneurs and professionals," says Paul Kearney, managing director and head of the private investment office.\par \par \uc2 "We want to make sure that we have a model that is ready for that - ensuring what we have is relevant, rather than shoehorning what we do on to a mobile platform."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150829eb8t0002f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

While this week's events are being described as a correction, rather than a crash, the global outlook from economic forecasters can best be summed up as "fear, but not panic".\par \par \uc2 For private investors taking stock of their portfolios, here are the questions you need to ask as you prepare to navigate future volatility:\par \par \uc2 How worried should investors be about events this week?\par \par \uc2 China was the catalyst for this week's sell off. The Shanghai Composite Index slumped on "Black Monday" after Beijing enacted a surprise currency devaluation, followed on Tuesday by cutting interest rates.\par \par \uc2 While markets elsewhere have largely rebounded, the Shanghai index finished 8 per cent lower on the week.\par \par \uc2 Traders can play the short-term markets, but investors need to think long term. This week, advisers urged investors not to panic, to take any actions in stages, and consider how to diversify their holdings.\par \par \uc2 Data from trading platforms show that private investors used the volatility to buy into some of the UK's biggest listed companies.\par \par \uc2 The Share Centre\uc2  reported three times the usual amount of trading activity on Monday, with 42 per cent of trades being FTSE 100 listed stocks. Lloyds, \uc2 GlaxoSmithKline\uc2 , \uc2 BP\uc2  and \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell\uc2  were its most popular traded stocks on that day, but overall 45 per cent of orders were buys, and 55 per cent were sells.\par \par \uc2 It was a similar story at direct-to-consumer investment platforms including \uc2 Barclays Stockbrokers\uc2  and TD Direct - though a survey of more than 8,000 clients of Interactive Investor carried out for FT Money showed that 78 per cent had not been tempted to buy stocks, bonds or funds as the markets fell.\par \par \uc2 Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at Interactive Investor, says: "The panic button has not been pushed by 'have and hold' investors."\par \par \uc2 Looking forward, equity markets - and "bond proxies" in particular - still look overpriced. Commodities are cheap for a reason, as prices have been driven down by declining demand from China, though brave contrarians may now be sizing up the sector. Many investors may choose to sit on cash, and wait for bigger falls to bring buying opportunities.\par \par \uc2 The FTSE 100 was hit harder than many other developed market indices because of its overseas-facing companies, many of which are exposed to China and other emerging markets. Its largest names include miners and oil companies, categories that have suffered far more than companies focused on UK consumers.\par \par \uc2 While the index has bounced back, this week's events were a wake-up call for those invested in passive funds that track the market.\par \par \uc2 "You may be happy that over the long term it will even out, but investors need to be aware that passive funds are large-cap dominated and will hold many companies that have already risen in value," says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\par \par \uc2 "There is a real risk of a hard landing for China and therefore we think there is scope for further losses on commodity funds and emerging market investments despite the already significant declines," says \uc2 Jason Hollands\uc2 , managing director at Tilney Bestinvest.\par \par \uc2 Which investments provided the best insulation?\par \par \uc2 Active managers of UK equity funds shielded investors from the worst of this year's market turmoil, with almost seven in 10 performing better than the falling FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share indices.\par \par \uc2 A focus on the UK domestic economy has saved many funds from a battering at the hands of international markets. Before this week's volatility, funds such as Standard Life's UK Opportunities and UK Ethical funds each shed about one per cent over the past month, according to figures from FE \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , even as the FTSE 100 dropped 7.2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Two Miton funds, UK Value Opportunities and Undervalued Assets, each declined by less than four per cent over the same period. All four of these funds made returns of at least 10 per cent over the past year, even as the FTSE 100 was down 10.9 per cent. The Miton Undervalued Assets fund has a particularly strong record over three years, returning 80 per cent to investors over that period and placing it in the top 1 per cent of funds.\par \par \uc2 "We've seen wages growing ahead of inflation and now consumers can make the decision to spend that on things like TVs and cars. We are overweight companies that benefit from that," says Henry Flockhart, investment director at Standard Life.\par \par \uc2 Similar patterns are evident across UK actively managed equity funds, according to statistics from Hargreaves Lansdown and Lipper. A focus on domestic-facing stocks rather than FTSE 100 mega-caps helped 60 per cent of active funds beat the highest-performing tracker over six months, and almost 70 per cent over the past three months, according to Lipper.\par \par \uc2 Jake Moeller\uc2 , head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, notes that UK equity income funds fared well due to their naturally defensive positioning, while utility stocks have also helped many of the better-performing funds.\par \par \uc2 "Some fund managers have eschewed utilities because of the level of state ownership but anything which has exposure to inelastic demand is going to be much more buoyant at the moment," he says.\par \par \uc2 Mr Flockhart at \uc2 Standard Life Investments\uc2  says he is looking to add to holdings in FTSE 100-listed \uc2 Burberry\uc2 , the luxury fashion retailer, whose shares have fallen almost 28 per cent since its peak in February, due to its exposure to Asian markets.\par \par \uc2 "That's obviously been hit by the slowdown but it's the kind of long-term story that we'd still be happy to add to. It's about the middle classes in emerging markets and it's away from the infrastructure-driven growth that we've seen," Mr Flockhart says.\par \par \uc2 Georgina Hamilton, co-manager of the Miton UK Value Opportunities and Miton Undervalued Assets funds, says lower stock prices had enabled her to top-up holdings in domestically focused UK companies with strong balance sheets.\par \par \uc2 The Miton managers have favoured companies in areas such as home maintenance and improvement, and retailers such as \uc2 JD Sports\uc2 . They also hold housebuilders such as \uc2 Bellway\uc2  and Barratt. This is a sector that the Standard Life managers view positively, holding stocks such as \uc2 Galliford Try\uc2  and \uc2 Crest Nicholson\uc2 . They have been using the market turbulence to top up their holdings.\par \par \uc2 "Our large overweight in the housebuilding sector has worked very well for us, particularly since the general election," says Lesley Duncan, investment director at Standard Life.\par \par \uc2 However, it is hard to find a fund manager who thinks that oil or mining stocks are cheap. "A number of oil companies and miners have looked overly leveraged to us, with too little cash flow," adds Ms Hamilton. "They need not only to be cheap, but to have a strong balance sheet."\par \par \uc2 Global asset managers say European equities look more attractive. "For investors, one key takeaway is that selling has restored value in some areas, particularly Europe," says Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock.\par \par \uc2 Companies exposed to global trade, especially in Germany, have been particularly punished, he says, leading to German stocks now trading at less than 12 times forward earnings and 1.5 times book value - about 45 per cent lower than the US market.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management\uc2  also sees value in European equities, but is more cautious about emerging markets, which have been directly affected by China's turmoil.\par \par \uc2 Some managers were even more cautious. F&C's multi-manager team, headed by Rob Burdett and \uc2 Gary Potter\uc2 , says the current "heightened volatility . . . creates opportunities for investors, but for the moment we are not significantly adding to positions".\par \par \uc2 Savers who do not have to access their pension for a number of years have been advised to sit tight as losses should be recouped over the longer term, but those who have entered drawdown have more to fear.\par \par \uc2 Pension provider Hargreaves Lansdown has put together an action plan for retirement savers in drawdown plans. It suggests pensioners keep at least one year's income in cash in their pension plan, to serve as a buffer during extreme markets.\par \par \uc2 Hargreaves also recommends limiting withdrawals from a drawdown plan. "Falling markets could have a significant impact on those drawing too much from their pension plans," says \uc2 Danny Cox\uc2 , head of financial planning at Hargreaves. "Spend too much and the drawdown plan can suffer irreparable damage."\par \par \uc2 The third piece of advice is for savers to draw income from underlying assets in the plan not the capital, to avoid exacerbating losses. "Investors who stick to a natural yield strategy should be better placed to navigate choppy waters," says Mr Cox.\par \par \uc2 The fourth point is a rudimentary one: ensure your portfolio is diverse and balanced with a mix of assets including cash, fixed interest products and shares.\par \par \uc2 Bonds tend to do well during times of market volatility, particularly those in perceived "havens" such as UK and \uc2 German government\uc2  bonds. Prices in both markets rise when investors are worried about the rest of the market.\par \par \uc2 Yields on ten-year UK gilts, the market benchmark, fell below 1.7 per cent early this week, although they have since climbed back to 1.9 per cent as the situation calmed.\par \par \uc2 If wider market volatility continues and investors push back their expectations for interest rate rises in the US and UK, money could keep pouring into gilts, meaning that yields will keep tracking down.\par \par \uc2 Investors who have taken more risks with their money, putting it into, say, emerging market bonds, have had a difficult week. \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  says total returns on emerging market bonds denominated in local currencies are now down by 12 per cent in the year to date.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, it is notable that bonds have not experienced the same drama as equities, commodities and currencies. Where prices go from here will depend on what China and the US do next.\par \par \uc2 Regulators in the US and UK have dropped hints that the turmoil is likely to push back a rise in interest rates. Predictions that \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  would raise US interest rates in September are looking shaky: \uc2 William Dudley\uc2 , a top Fed official, told a conference this week that the case for tightening monetary policy as early as September "seem[s] less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago," though his comments were followed by stronger-than-expected economic data.\par \par \uc2 The speed of a UK rate rise had already been a matter of debate after only one member of the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 's Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rise this month. The volatility on stock markets is likely to reinforce such a view.\par \par \uc2 Another reason to think rates may stay at their record lows is the recent drop in the oil price. Placing aside Thursday's "short squeeze" , falling commodities prices mean economists are reviewing their earlier expectations of inflation rises towards the end of the year. For now, consumer price indices may well remain flat or even retreat into deflation territory, discouraging a rate boost.\par \par \uc2 Mortgage lenders have shown little consensus in recent days over the direction of the market. Ray Boulger, technical director at broker John Charcol, says: "Some lenders have put rates up a bit; some have been put them down; some have been putting some up and some down."\par \par \uc2 But in the medium term, the longer the wait for a \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  rate rise, the longer borrowers have to take advantage of record low interest rates on fixed-term mortgages.\par \par \uc2 "It does seem to me that the first rise in the bank rate has to be put back, so from a cost point of view that has to be an advantage," Mr Boulger says.\par \par \uc2 Property observers have speculated on the impact of Asian turmoil on demand for top London property among overseas buyers, traditionally a key part of the capital's prime market. But rather than constraining demand, some believe the events of the past week will stoke it, much as the eurozone crisis of 2010 brought an influx of Italian, French and Greek buyers to London.\par \par \uc2 Grainne Gilmore, Knight Frank head of UK residential research, says there had been an intensification of interest from Chinese buyers. "The extra volatility has enhanced London's reputation as a safe haven property market."\par \par \uc2 Yolande Barnes\uc2 , head of Savills World Research, agrees that wealthy overseas buyers looking to diversify their portfolios could give a boost to the top end of the London market. But the effect would be small and balanced by slower wealth creation and lower levels of investment. "Ultimately, the net effect is likely to be neutral."\par \par \uc2 Reporting by Judith Evans, Claer Barrett, James Pickford, Lucy Warwick Ching and Elaine Moore\par \par \uc2 Poll Investors show caution\par \par \uc2 78% Say they have not been tempted to buy stocks, bonds or funds as the markets fell\par \par \uc2 51% Believe this week's volatility is a "temporary correction"\par \par \uc2 15% Believe it signals "the start of the next crash"\par \par \uc2 Source: Interactive Investor.

While this week\u8217\'20\'19s events are being described as a correction, rather than a crash, the global outlook from economic forecasters can best be summed up as \u8220\'20\'1Cfear, but not panic\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 For private investors taking stock of their portfolios, here are the questions you need to ask as you prepare to navigate future volatility:\par \par \uc2 How worried should investors be about events this week?\par \par \uc2 China was the catalyst for this week\u8217\'20\'19s sell off. The Shanghai Composite Index slumped on \u8220\'20\'1CBlack Monday\u8221\'20\'1D after Beijing enacted a surprise currency devaluation, followed on Tuesday by cutting interest rates.\par \par \uc2 While markets elsewhere have largely rebounded, the Shanghai index finished 8 per cent lower on the week.\par \par \uc2 Traders can play the short-term markets, but investors need to think long term. This week, advisers urged investors not to panic, to take any actions in stages, and consider how to diversify their holdings.\par \par \uc2 Data from trading platforms show that private investors used the volatility to buy into some of the UK\u8217\'20\'19s biggest listed companies.\par \par \uc2 The Share Centre\uc2  reported three times the usual amount of trading activity on Monday, with 42 per cent of trades being FTSE 100 listed stocks. Lloyds, \uc2 GlaxoSmithKline\uc2 , \uc2 BP\uc2  and \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell\uc2  were its most popular traded stocks on that day, but overall 45 per cent of orders were buys, and 55 per cent were sells.\par \par \uc2 It was a similar story at direct-to-consumer investment platforms including \uc2 Barclays Stockbrokers\uc2  and TD Direct \u8212\'20\'14 though a survey of more than 8,000 clients of Interactive Investor carried out for FT Money showed that 78 per cent had not been tempted to buy stocks, bonds or funds as the markets fell.\par \par \uc2 Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at Interactive Investor, says: \u8220\'20\'1CThe panic button has not been pushed by \u8216\'20\'18have and hold\u8217\'20\'19 investors.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Looking forward, equity markets \u8212\'20\'14 and \u8220\'20\'1Cbond proxies\u8221\'20\'1D in particular \u8212\'20\'14 still look overpriced. Commodities are cheap for a reason, as prices have been driven down by declining demand from China, though brave contrarians may now be sizing up the sector. Many investors may choose to sit on cash, and wait for bigger falls to bring more attractive buying opportunities.\par \par \uc2 Which areas suffered the most?\par \par \uc2 The FTSE 100 was hit harder than many other developed market indices because of its overseas-facing companies, many of which are exposed to China and other emerging markets. Its largest names include miners and oil companies, categories that have suffered far more than companies focused on UK consumers.\par \par \uc2 While the index has bounced back, this week\u8217\'20\'19s events were a wake-up call for those invested in passive funds that track the market.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou may be happy that over the long term it will even out, but investors need to be aware that passive funds are large-cap dominated and will hold many companies that have already risen in value,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Laith Khalaf\uc2 , senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a real risk of a hard landing for China and therefore we think there is scope for further losses on commodity funds and emerging market investments despite the already significant declines,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Bestinvest.\par \par \uc2 Which investments provided the best insulation?\par \par \uc2 Active managers of UK equity funds shielded investors from the worst of this year\u8217\'20\'19s market turmoil, with almost seven in 10 performing better than the falling FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share indices.\par \par \uc2 A focus on the UK domestic economy has saved many funds from a battering at the hands of international markets. Before this week\u8217\'20\'19s volatility, funds such as Standard Life\u8217\'20\'19s UK Opportunities and UK Ethical funds each shed about one per cent over the past month, according to figures from FE \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , even as the FTSE 100 dropped 7.2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Two Miton funds, UK Value Opportunities and Undervalued Assets, each declined by less than four per cent over the same period. All four of these funds made returns of at least 10 per cent over the past year, even as the FTSE 100 was down 10.9 per cent. The Miton Undervalued Assets fund has a particularly strong record over three years, returning 80 per cent to investors over that period and placing it in the top 1 per cent of funds.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve seen wages growing ahead of inflation and now consumers can make the decision to spend that on things like TVs and cars. We are overweight companies that benefit from that,\u8221\'20\'1D says Henry Flockhart, investment director at Standard Life.\par \par \uc2 Similar patterns are evident across UK actively managed equity funds, according to statistics from \uc2 Hargreaves Lansdown\uc2  and Lipper. A focus on domestic-facing stocks rather than FTSE 100 mega-caps has helped 60 per cent of active funds to beat the highest-performing tracker over six months, and almost 70 per cent over the past three months, according to Lipper.\par \par \uc2 Jake Moeller\uc2 , head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, notes that UK equity income funds had fared well thanks to their naturally defensive positioning, while utility stocks have also helped many of the better-performing funds.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSome fund managers have eschewed utilities because of the level of state ownership but anything which has exposure to inelastic demand is going to be much more buoyant at the moment,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Where do fund managers sense buying opportunities?\par \par \uc2 Mr Flockhart at \uc2 Standard Life Investments\uc2  says he was looking this week to add to his existing holdings in FTSE 100-listed \uc2 Burberry\uc2 , the luxury fashion retailer, which has seen its shares slide by almost 28 per cent since its peak in February thanks to its exposure to Asian markets.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s obviously been hit by the slowdown but it\u8217\'20\'19s the kind of long-term story that we\u8217\'20\'19d still be happy to add to. It\u8217\'20\'19s about the middle classes in emerging markets and it\u8217\'20\'19s away from the infrastructure-driven growth that we\u8217\'20\'19ve seen,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Flockhart says.\par \par \uc2 Georgina Hamilton, co-manager of the Miton UK Value Opportunities and Miton Undervalued Assets funds, says lower stock prices had enabled her to top-up holdings in domestically focused UK companies with strong balance sheets.\par \par \uc2 The Miton managers have favoured companies in areas such as home maintenance and improvement, and retailers such as \uc2 JD Sports\uc2 . They also hold housebuilders such as \uc2 Bellway\uc2  and Barratt. This is a sector that the Standard Life managers also view positively, holding stocks such as \uc2 Galliford Try\uc2  and \uc2 Crest Nicholson\uc2 . They have been using the market turbulence to top up their holdings.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur large overweight in the housebuilding sector has worked very well for us, particularly since the general election [in May],\u8221\'20\'1D says Lesley Duncan, investment director at Standard Life.\par \par \uc2 However, it is hard to find a fund manager who thinks that oil or mining stocks are cheap.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA number of oil companies and miners have looked overly leveraged to us, with too little cash flow in the context of their leverage,\u8221\'20\'1D adds Ms Hamilton. \u8220\'20\'1CThey need not only to be cheap, but have a strong balance sheet.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Further afield, global asset managers say European equities look more attractive.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor investors, one key takeaway is that selling has restored value in some areas of the market, particularly in Europe,\u8221\'20\'1D says Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest asset manager.\par \par \uc2 Companies exposed to global trade, especially in Germany, have been particularly punished, he says, leading to German stocks now trading at less than 12 times forward earnings and 1.5 times book value \u8212\'20\'14 about 45 per cent lower than the US market.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management\uc2  says it also saw value in European equities, but was more cautious about emerging markets, which have been most directly affected by China\u8217\'20\'19s turmoil.\par \par \uc2 Some managers were even more cautious, however. F&C\u8217\'20\'19s multi-manager team, headed by Rob Burdett and \uc2 Gary Potter\uc2 , says the current \u8220\'20\'1Cheightened volatility\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09does create opportunities for investors, but for the moment we are staying patient and not significantly adding to positions\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Should I panic about my pension?\par \par \uc2 Savers who do not have to access their pension for a number of years have been advised to sit tight as losses should be recouped over the longer term, but those who have entered drawdown have more to fear.\par \par \uc2 Pension provider \uc2 Hargreaves Lansdown\uc2  has put together an action plan for retirement savers in drawdown plans. The first thing it suggests is for pensioners to keep at least one year\u8217\'20\'19s income in cash in their pension plan, to serve as a buffer during extreme markets.\par \par \uc2 Hargreaves also recommends limiting withdrawals from a drawdown plan. \u8220\'20\'1CFalling markets could have a significant impact on those drawing too much from their pension plans,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Danny Cox\uc2 , head of financial planning at Hargreaves. \u8220\'20\'1CSpend too much and the drawdown plan can suffer irreparable damage.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The third piece of advice is for savers to draw income from the underlying assets in the plan not the capital, to avoid exacerbating losses. \u8220\'20\'1CInvestors who stick to a natural yield strategy should be better placed to navigate choppy waters,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Cox.\par \par \uc2 The fourth point is a rudimentary one: ensure your portfolio is diverse and balanced with a mixture of assets including cash, fixed interest products and shares to protect it during market falls.\par \par \uc2 What about bonds?\par \par \uc2 Bonds tend to do well during times of market volatility, particularly those in perceived \u8220\'20\'1Chavens\u8221\'20\'1D such as UK and \uc2 German government\uc2  bonds. Prices in both markets rise when investors are worried about the rest of the market.\par \par \uc2 Yields on ten-year UK gilts, the market benchmark, fell below 1.7 per cent this week, although they have since climbed back to 1.9 per cent as the situation calmed.\par \par \uc2 If wider market volatility continues and investors push back their expectations for interest rate rises in the US and UK, then money could keep pouring into gilts, meaning that yields will keep tracking down.\par \par \uc2 Investors who have taken more risks with their money, putting it into, say, emerging market bonds, will have experienced a difficult week. According to \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , total returns on emerging market bonds denominated in local currencies are now down by 12 per cent in the year to date.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, it is notable that bonds have not experienced the same drama as equities, commodities and currencies. Where prices go from here will depend on what China and the US do next.\par \par \uc2 Will volatility delay an interest rate rise?\par \par \uc2 Regulators in the US and UK have dropped hints that the turmoil is likely to push back a rise in interest rates. Predictions that \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  would raise US interest rates in September are looking shaky: \uc2 William Dudley\uc2 , a top Fed official, told a conference this week that the case for tightening monetary policy as early as September \u8220\'20\'1Cseem[s] less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,\u8221\'20\'1D though his comments were followed by stronger-than-expected economic data.\par \par \uc2 The speed of a UK rate rise had already been a matter of debate after only one member of the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rise this month. The volatility on stock markets is likely to reinforce such a view.\par \par \uc2 Another reason to think rates may stay at their record lows is the recent drop in the oil price. Placing aside Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cshort squeeze\u8221\'20\'1D, falling commodities prices mean economists are reviewing their earlier expectations of inflation rises towards the end of the year. For now, consumer price indices may well remain flat or even retreat into deflation territory, discouraging a rate boost.\par \par \uc2 What could this mean for the property market?\par \par \uc2 Mortgage lenders have been showing little consensus in recent days over the direction of the market. Ray Boulger, technical director at broker John Charcol, says: \u8220\'20\'1CSome lenders have been putting rates up a bit; some have been putting them down; some have been putting some up and some down.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But in the medium term, the longer the wait for a \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  rate rise, the longer borrowers have to take advantage of record low interest rates on fixed-term mortgages.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt does seem to me that the first rise in the bank rate has got to be put back, so from a cost point of view that has to be an advantage,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Boulger says.\par \par \uc2 Property observers have speculated on the impact of Asian turmoil on the demand for top London property among overseas buyers, traditionally a key part of the capital\u8217\'20\'19s prime market. But rather than constraining demand, some believe the events of the past week will stoke it, much as the eurozone crisis of 2010 brought an influx of Italian, French and Greek buyers to London.\par \par \uc2 Grainne Gilmore, Knight Frank head of UK residential research, says there had been an intensification of interest from Chinese buyers. \u8220\'20\'1CThe extra volatility has enhanced London\u8217\'20\'19s reputation as a safe haven property market.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Yolande Barnes\uc2 , head of Savills World Research, agrees that wealthy overseas buyers looking to diversify their portfolios could give a boost to the top end of the London market. But the effect would be small and balanced by slower wealth creation and lower levels of investment. \u8220\'20\'1CUltimately, the net effect is likely to be neutral.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Reporting by Judith Evans, Claer Barrett, James Pickford, Lucy Warwick Ching and Elaine Moore.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020150828eb8s0060p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

While this week\u8217\'20\'19s events are being described as a correction, rather than a crash, the global outlook from economic forecasters can best be summed up as \u8220\'20\'1Cfear, but not panic\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 For private investors taking stock of their portfolios, here are the questions you need to ask as you prepare to navigate future volatility:\par \par \uc2 How worried should investors be about events this week?\par \par \uc2 China was the catalyst for this week\u8217\'20\'19s sell off. The Shanghai Composite Index slumped on \u8220\'20\'1CBlack Monday\u8221\'20\'1D after Beijing enacted a surprise currency devaluation, followed on Tuesday by cutting interest rates.\par \par \uc2 While markets elsewhere have largely rebounded, the Shanghai index finished 8 per cent lower on the week.\par \par \uc2 Traders can play the short-term markets, but investors need to think long term. This week, advisers urged investors not to panic, to take any actions in stages, and consider how to diversify their holdings.\par \par \uc2 Data from trading platforms show that private investors used the volatility to buy into some of the UK\u8217\'20\'19s biggest listed companies.\par \par \uc2 The Share Centre\uc2  reported three times the usual amount of trading activity on Monday, with 42 per cent of trades being FTSE 100 listed stocks. Lloyds, \uc2 GlaxoSmithKline\uc2 , \uc2 BP\uc2  and \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell\uc2  were its most popular traded stocks on that day, but overall 45 per cent of orders were buys, and 55 per cent were sells.\par \par \uc2 It was a similar story at direct-to-consumer investment platforms including \uc2 Barclays Stockbrokers\uc2  and TD Direct \u8212\'20\'14 though a survey of more than 8,000 clients of Interactive Investor carried out for FT Money showed that 78 per cent had not been tempted to buy stocks, bonds or funds as the markets fell.\par \par \uc2 Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at Interactive Investor, says: \u8220\'20\'1CThe panic button has not been pushed by \u8216\'20\'18have and hold\u8217\'20\'19 investors.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Looking forward, equity markets \u8212\'20\'14 and \u8220\'20\'1Cbond proxies\u8221\'20\'1D in particular \u8212\'20\'14 still look overpriced. Commodities are cheap for a reason, as prices have been driven down by declining demand from China, though brave contrarians may now be sizing up the sector. Many investors may choose to sit on cash, and wait for bigger falls to bring more attractive buying opportunities.\par \par \uc2 Which areas suffered the most?\par \par \uc2 The FTSE 100 was hit harder than many other developed market indices because of its overseas-facing companies, many of which are exposed to China and other emerging markets. Its largest names include miners and oil companies, categories that have suffered far more than companies focused on UK consumers.\par \par \uc2 While the index has bounced back, this week\u8217\'20\'19s events were a wake-up call for those invested in passive funds that track the market.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou may be happy that over the long term it will even out, but investors need to be aware that passive funds are large-cap dominated and will hold many companies that have already risen in value,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Laith Khalaf\uc2 , senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a real risk of a hard landing for China and therefore we think there is scope for further losses on commodity funds and emerging market investments despite the already significant declines,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Bestinvest.\par \par \uc2 Which investments provided the best insulation?\par \par \uc2 Active managers of UK equity funds shielded investors from the worst of this year\u8217\'20\'19s market turmoil, with almost seven in 10 performing better than the falling FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share indices.\par \par \uc2 A focus on the UK domestic economy has saved many funds from a battering at the hands of international markets. Before this week\u8217\'20\'19s volatility, funds such as Standard Life\u8217\'20\'19s UK Opportunities and UK Ethical funds each shed about one per cent over the past month, according to figures from FE \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , even as the FTSE 100 dropped 7.2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Two Miton funds, UK Value Opportunities and Undervalued Assets, each declined by less than four per cent over the same period. All four of these funds made returns of at least 10 per cent over the past year, even as the FTSE 100 was down 10.9 per cent. The Miton Undervalued Assets fund has a particularly strong record over three years, returning 80 per cent to investors over that period and placing it in the top 1 per cent of funds.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve seen wages growing ahead of inflation and now consumers can make the decision to spend that on things like TVs and cars. We are overweight companies that benefit from that,\u8221\'20\'1D says Henry Flockhart, investment director at Standard Life.\par \par \uc2 Similar patterns are evident across UK actively managed equity funds, according to statistics from \uc2 Hargreaves Lansdown\uc2  and Lipper. A focus on domestic-facing stocks rather than FTSE 100 mega-caps has helped 60 per cent of active funds to beat the highest-performing tracker over six months, and almost 70 per cent over the past three months, according to Lipper.\par \par \uc2 Jake Moeller\uc2 , head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, notes that UK equity income funds had fared well thanks to their naturally defensive positioning, while utility stocks have also helped many of the better-performing funds.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSome fund managers have eschewed utilities because of the level of state ownership but anything which has exposure to inelastic demand is going to be much more buoyant at the moment,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Where do fund managers sense buying opportunities?\par \par \uc2 Mr Flockhart at \uc2 Standard Life Investments\uc2  says he was looking this week to add to his existing holdings in FTSE 100-listed \uc2 Burberry\uc2 , the luxury fashion retailer, which has seen its shares slide by almost 28 per cent since its peak in February thanks to its exposure to Asian markets.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s obviously been hit by the slowdown but it\u8217\'20\'19s the kind of long-term story that we\u8217\'20\'19d still be happy to add to. It\u8217\'20\'19s about the middle classes in emerging markets and it\u8217\'20\'19s away from the infrastructure-driven growth that we\u8217\'20\'19ve seen,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Flockhart says.\par \par \uc2 Georgina Hamilton, co-manager of the Miton UK Value Opportunities and Miton Undervalued Assets funds, says lower stock prices had enabled her to top-up holdings in domestically focused UK companies with strong balance sheets.\par \par \uc2 The Miton managers have favoured companies in areas such as home maintenance and improvement, and retailers such as \uc2 JD Sports\uc2 . They also hold housebuilders such as \uc2 Bellway\uc2  and Barratt. This is a sector that the Standard Life managers also view positively, holding stocks such as \uc2 Galliford Try\uc2  and \uc2 Crest Nicholson\uc2 . They have been using the market turbulence to top up their holdings.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur large overweight in the housebuilding sector has worked very well for us, particularly since the general election [in May],\u8221\'20\'1D says Lesley Duncan, investment director at Standard Life.\par \par \uc2 However, it is hard to find a fund manager who thinks that oil or mining stocks are cheap.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA number of oil companies and miners have looked overly leveraged to us, with too little cash flow in the context of their leverage,\u8221\'20\'1D adds Ms Hamilton. \u8220\'20\'1CThey need not only to be cheap, but have a strong balance sheet.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Further afield, global asset managers say European equities look more attractive.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor investors, one key takeaway is that selling has restored value in some areas of the market, particularly in Europe,\u8221\'20\'1D says Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest asset manager.\par \par \uc2 Companies exposed to global trade, especially in Germany, have been particularly punished, he says, leading to German stocks now trading at less than 12 times forward earnings and 1.5 times book value \u8212\'20\'14 about 45 per cent lower than the US market.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management\uc2  says it also saw value in European equities, but was more cautious about emerging markets, which have been most directly affected by China\u8217\'20\'19s turmoil.\par \par \uc2 Some managers were even more cautious, however. F&C\u8217\'20\'19s multi-manager team, headed by Rob Burdett and \uc2 Gary Potter\uc2 , says the current \u8220\'20\'1Cheightened volatility\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09does create opportunities for investors, but for the moment we are staying patient and not significantly adding to positions\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Should I panic about my pension?\par \par \uc2 Savers who do not have to access their pension for a number of years have been advised to sit tight as losses should be recouped over the longer term, but those who have entered drawdown have more to fear.\par \par \uc2 Pension provider \uc2 Hargreaves Lansdown\uc2  has put together an action plan for retirement savers in drawdown plans. The first thing it suggests is for pensioners to keep at least one year\u8217\'20\'19s income in cash in their pension plan, to serve as a buffer during extreme markets.\par \par \uc2 Hargreaves also recommends limiting withdrawals from a drawdown plan. \u8220\'20\'1CFalling markets could have a significant impact on those drawing too much from their pension plans,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Danny Cox\uc2 , head of financial planning at Hargreaves. \u8220\'20\'1CSpend too much and the drawdown plan can suffer irreparable damage.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The third piece of advice is for savers to draw income from the underlying assets in the plan not the capital, to avoid exacerbating losses. \u8220\'20\'1CInvestors who stick to a natural yield strategy should be better placed to navigate choppy waters,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Cox.\par \par \uc2 The fourth point is a rudimentary one: ensure your portfolio is diverse and balanced with a mixture of assets including cash, fixed interest products and shares to protect it during market falls.\par \par \uc2 What about bonds?\par \par \uc2 Bonds tend to do well during times of market volatility, particularly those in perceived \u8220\'20\'1Chavens\u8221\'20\'1D such as UK and \uc2 German government\uc2  bonds. Prices in both markets rise when investors are worried about the rest of the market.\par \par \uc2 Yields on ten-year UK gilts, the market benchmark, fell below 1.7 per cent this week, although they have since climbed back to 1.9 per cent as the situation calmed.\par \par \uc2 If wider market volatility continues and investors push back their expectations for interest rate rises in the US and UK, then money could keep pouring into gilts, meaning that yields will keep tracking down.\par \par \uc2 Investors who have taken more risks with their money, putting it into, say, emerging market bonds, will have experienced a difficult week. According to \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , total returns on emerging market bonds denominated in local currencies are now down by 12 per cent in the year to date.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, it is notable that bonds have not experienced the same drama as equities, commodities and currencies. Where prices go from here will depend on what China and the US do next.\par \par \uc2 Will volatility delay an interest rate rise?\par \par \uc2 Regulators in the US and UK have dropped hints that the turmoil is likely to push back a rise in interest rates. Predictions that \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  would raise US interest rates in September are looking shaky: \uc2 William Dudley\uc2 , a top Fed official, told a conference this week that the case for tightening monetary policy as early as September \u8220\'20\'1Cseem[s] less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,\u8221\'20\'1D though his comments were followed by stronger-than-expected economic data.\par \par \uc2 The speed of a UK rate rise had already been a matter of debate after only one member of the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rise this month. The volatility on stock markets is likely to reinforce such a view.\par \par \uc2 Another reason to think rates may stay at their record lows is the recent drop in the oil price. Placing aside Thursday\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cshort squeeze\u8221\'20\'1D, falling commodities prices mean economists are reviewing their earlier expectations of inflation rises towards the end of the year. For now, consumer price indices may well remain flat or even retreat into deflation territory, discouraging a rate boost.\par \par \uc2 What could this mean for the property market?\par \par \uc2 Mortgage lenders have been showing little consensus in recent days over the direction of the market. Ray Boulger, technical director at broker John Charcol, says: \u8220\'20\'1CSome lenders have been putting rates up a bit; some have been putting them down; some have been putting some up and some down.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But in the medium term, the longer the wait for a \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  rate rise, the longer borrowers have to take advantage of record low interest rates on fixed-term mortgages.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt does seem to me that the first rise in the bank rate has got to be put back, so from a cost point of view that has to be an advantage,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Boulger says.\par \par \uc2 Property observers have speculated on the impact of Asian turmoil on the demand for top London property among overseas buyers, traditionally a key part of the capital\u8217\'20\'19s prime market. But rather than constraining demand, some believe the events of the past week will stoke it, much as the eurozone crisis of 2010 brought an influx of Italian, French and Greek buyers to London.\par \par \uc2 Grainne Gilmore, Knight Frank head of UK residential research, says there had been an intensification of interest from Chinese buyers. \u8220\'20\'1CThe extra volatility has enhanced London\u8217\'20\'19s reputation as a safe haven property market.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Yolande Barnes\uc2 , head of Savills World Research, agrees that wealthy overseas buyers looking to diversify their portfolios could give a boost to the top end of the London market. But the effect would be small and balanced by slower wealth creation and lower levels of investment. \u8220\'20\'1CUltimately, the net effect is likely to be neutral.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Reporting by Judith Evans, Claer Barrett, James Pickford, Lucy Warwick Ching and Elaine Moore.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCMA00020150828eb8s0060p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 HONG KONG\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2  is looking for buying opportunities in China's commercial property market amid slowing growth and market turbulence in the world's No. 2 economy.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Heady, head of the private-equity firm's closely watched Asia real-estate business, said employment remained high and the service sector healthy in certain Chinese markets despite the broader slowdown in growth. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople are still spending money and standards of living are improving," he said in an interview Wednesday. \u8220\'20\'1CWe see over the medium to long term this trend as continuing."\par \par \uc2 That means choice properties in top-tier markets such as Beijing and Shanghai as well as in second-tier cities remain attractive, Mr. Heady said. The fund is less focused on less developed Chinese cities, which are more likely to be dependent on a single industry, he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CVolatility can be your friend if you have a medium to long term perspective," he said. \u8220\'20\'1CIn public capital markets, when prices come down in theory that should create opportunities."\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  is a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstones-latest-fund-raises-14-5-billion-in-institutional-capital-1427734491"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 property heavyweight  }}}\uc2  in Asia and abroad. \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 's Asia property fund, Blackstone Real Estate Partners Asia, is the region's largest, raising a total of $5 billion over four closings since 2013, according to industry data tracker Preqin. It has counted as partners major investors such as major domestic developer \uc2 China Vanke Co\uc2 . and the \uc2 State Administration of Foreign Exchange\uc2 , China's currency-exchange agency.\par \par \uc2 Other developers have sounded cautious notes about the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-flood-economy-with-cash-as-global-markets-lose-faith-1440380912"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Chinese economy  }}}\uc2 , which is set to grow at its slowest pace in 25 years. Those fears have sparked a global market selloff in recent days.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou get pretty spooked by what's been happening. Could this trigger a wider issue in global financial markets?" said Mark Gabbay, chief executive at \uc2 LaSalle Investment Management\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CIt hasn't impacted the real-estate market just yet, but it's a yellow flag."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/25/global-markets-set-for-more-volatility-live-blog/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Volatility  }}}\uc2  is making it difficult to sell assets in China now, Mr. Gabbay said, adding that risk premiums are rising as well. \u8220\'20\'1CAre we in crisis zone? Yes, but not long enough to make material changes to our portfolio," he said, adding that \uc2 LaSalle Investment Management\uc2  had already moderated its exposure in China to around 10% of its Asia portfolio in recent years as Japan and Australia looked more attractive.\par \par \uc2 Such volatility can lead to bottom-fishing opportunities, but only in select markets, said Goodwin Gaw, chairman of Hong Kong-based investor Gaw Capital Partners. Mr. Gaw echoed Mr. Heady in describing volatility as a \u8220\'20\'1Cfriend," adding that Gaw Capital has been cautious in China in the past few years as it focused on only select \u8220\'20\'1Ctrophy assets" and specific niche sectors such as logistics.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf the recent volatility results in distressed situations with forced sale opportunities, then funds availability will actually increase rather than decrease," said Mr. Gaw. \u8220\'20\'1CU.S. is actually getting quite healthy and Europe stabilizing so China weaknesses could provide a window for Western investors to increase exposure into China."\par \par \uc2 China's commercial property market is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/07/22/chinas-latest-ground-zero-for-property-glut-shenyang/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 slowing  }}}\uc2 , according to Chinese government statistics.\par \par \uc2 Investment in office-building development rose more than 13% to 326.4 billion yuan ($50.92 billion) in the first seven months of 2015 from a year earlier, compared with growth of more than 21% for all of 2014.\par \par \uc2 Office-building construction starts fell nearly 15% to 32.96 million square meters in the first seven months of this year from the year-ago period, compared with 6.7% growth for all of last year.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 's Mr. Heady said recent market turmoil\u8212\'20\'14-which knocked China's main stock index down by more than one-fifth in four trading days alone\u8212\'20\'14-and a surprise devaluation of the yuan this month have had only a limited impact.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMore relevant to us is the real economy. There, frankly, we haven't seen a tremendous change over the past few months or at least in last couple of weeks of volatility," Mr. Heady said. \u8220\'20\'1COur views remain fairly consistent as it relates to China. The economy is slowing down and I don't think that's a big surprise to anybody."\par \par \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  is focusing on real-estate plays that focus on middle-class consumption, he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere's going to be a series of bumps along the road as the economy transitions away from heavy fixed asset investment, which over time will have a diminishing return on investment," Mr. Heady said. \u8220\'20\'1CThe result of that transition is the growth rate is overall slowing down. It's almost as if there's two-speed economy. Some parts are growing slower than others. The old economy sectors like industrials, commodity and heavy industries are suffering considerably right now."\par \par \uc2 China makes up around 40% of \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 's real-estate investments in Asia, with the rest in India, Japan, Australia and Singapore.\par \par \uc2 Nearly $250 billion has been invested into Chinese real estate from overseas in the past decade, of which development sites accounted for 75%, according to a recent report by investment management firm \uc2 TH Real Estate\uc2 , citing data from \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Investors from the U.S., including \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 , make up 7% of the inbound investment, the third-largest group behind Hong Kong's 70% and Singapore's 15%.\par \par \uc2 Write to Esther Fung at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:esther.fung@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 esther.fung@wsj.com  }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150826eb8q001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 U.S. investor \uc2 TIAA-CREF\uc2  and Swedish National Pension Funds AP1 and AP2 have teamed up on European office investments.\par \par \uc2 Their joint venture will combine \u8364\'20\'AC2.2 billion ($2.5 billion) worth of 15 properties already owned by the firms, and over the next three years will aim to buy another \u8364\'20\'AC2 billion of office space.\par \par \uc2 By merging the property portfolios, \u8220\'20\'1Cwe're going to be able to diversity our European office portfolio without any more capital requirements," said \uc2 Phil McAndrews\uc2 , chief investment officer of \uc2 TIAA-CREF\uc2  Global Real Estate.\par \par \uc2 The groups plan to make further office acquisitions in Europe, focusing on London, Paris and cities across Germany.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe believe there is a case for core assets in Europe," Mr. McAndrews said.\par \par \uc2 The tie-up comes amid a surge of demand for commercial property in Europe, where the pace of deal-making in the first half of this year was the strongest since 2007, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Investors bought $49.4 billion of office properties in Europe in the first half of 2015, up 17% from the year before, data show.\par \par \uc2 Returns in real estate look attractive to investors facing low interest rates. In the London neighborhood of Mayfair, home to many of Europe's biggest hedge funds, the capitalization rate\u8212\'20\'14a measure of yield\u8212\'20\'14was at a historic low of 3.5% in June, according to real-estate broker \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield\uc2 . This is still above the yield on 10-year \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  bonds, which Tuesday was around 1.87%, according to Tradeweb.\par \par \uc2 The new investment vehicle, called Cityhold Office Partnership, will be managed by \uc2 TH Real Estate\uc2 , an overseas investment manager owned by \uc2 TIAA-CREF\uc2 , which has $86 billion of real-estate assets under management.\par \par \uc2 The funds will target core assets in major cities because \u8220\'20\'1Cin the short term, our preference is liquidity," said Jasper Gilbey, director at \uc2 TH Real Estate\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Investments can also branch out into areas that typically offer greater returns. The funds can be invested into leasing, renovation and development projects in London, Paris and Germany, as well as target core assets in cities like Madrid, Milan and Amsterdam.\par \par \uc2 AP1 and AP2 are two of five such funds in the Swedish pension system. Both funds have about 300 billion Swedish kronor ($36 billion) of assets under management.\par \par \uc2 Write to Art Patnaude at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:art.patnaude@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 art.patnaude@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150826eb8q0015p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

The groups plan to make further office acquisitions in Europe, focusing on London, Paris and cities across Germany.\par \par \uc2 "We believe there is a case for core assets in Europe," Mr. McAndrews said.\par \par \uc2 The tie-up comes amid a surge of demand for commercial property in Europe, where the pace of deal-making in the first half of this year was the strongest since 2007, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Investors bought $49.4 billion of office properties in Europe in the first half of 2015, up 17% from the year before, data show.\par \par \uc2 Returns in real estate look attractive to investors facing low interest rates. In the London neighborhood of Mayfair, home to many of Europe's biggest hedge funds, the capitalization rate -- a measure of yield -- was at a historic low of 3.5% in June, according to real-estate broker Cushman & Wakefield. This is still above the yield on 10-year \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  bonds, which Tuesday was around 1.87%, according to Tradeweb.\par \par \uc2 The new investment vehicle, called Cityhold Office Partnership, will be managed by \uc2 TH Real Estate\uc2 , an overseas investment manager owned by \uc2 TIAA-CREF\uc2 , which has $86 billion of real-estate assets under management.\par \par \uc2 The funds will target core assets in major cities because "in the short term, our preference is liquidity," said Jasper Gilbey, director at \uc2 TH Real Estate\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Investments also can branch out into areas that typically offer greater returns. The funds can be invested into leasing, renovation and development projects in London, Paris and Germany, as well as target core assets in cities like Madrid, Milan and Amsterdam.\par \par \uc2 AP1 and AP2 are two of five such funds in the Swedish pension system. Both funds have about 300 billion Swedish kronor ($36 billion) of assets under management.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150826000096"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150826eb8q0002g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Boston Company has hired the Tabb Metrics data-driven \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company created by \uc2 Tabb Group\uc2  to help analyze transaction costs for carrying out trades in the markets.\par \par \uc2 A group of researchers led by former \uc2 Barclays PLC\uc2  executives Linda Giordano and Jeff Alexander compared the time-stamped results from Boston Company's brokers with data from Thesys Technologies LLC, the technology arm of the high-frequency trading firm Tradeworx Inc.\par \par \uc2 What they found is the Boston Company's orders at times were getting filled at prices that were "suboptimal" in some dark pools, meaning they could potentially have gotten a better result if a trade was carried out more quickly.\par \par \uc2 The researchers said costs associated with weak infrastructure and slow processing were at times as much as 50 times higher than cases in which fast traders are able to find small opportunities to buy or sell stocks at better prices than other investors relying on slower data feeds.\par \par \uc2 David Brooks, the head trader at Boston Company, said the results appeared to confirm something his team had felt anecdotally for years: "It felt like there was a cost in trying to trade in the more than 40 venues across the market," he said.\par \par \uc2 Boston Company had persistent problems in some pools with a particular order type that was designed to achieve a buy or sell at the midpoint between the best bid and offer for a stock in the market, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 For instance, if a stock was offered to buy at $10 and for sale at $10.02, Boston Company might seek to obtain a midpoint purchase in a dark pool at $10.01.\par \par \uc2 But in the high-speed market, prices change rapidly and opportunities can easily be missed because of latency issues. If the market for that share rapidly changed to $9.99 to buy and $10.01 to sell, Boston Company would prefer to obtain the shares at the midpoint, $10. Slower pools might not update in time to get the better price.\par \par \uc2 Such dark pools gave suboptimal fills for trades as much as 24.7% of the time, according to the study.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Brooks said he had instructed his brokers to "deprioritize" some dark pools after seeing the results of the research and change some of the strategies.\par \par \uc2 While Tabb didn't identify the dark pools by name in the study, the researchers said they had already held meetings with several of the operators about the processing problems. Some of the operators said they were making changes to reduce the problem, they said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150826000036"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150826eb8q0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved  \par \par \uc2 As global stock markets tumble and analysts fret over the health of economies such as China and Brazil, bond investors are saying once again, we told you so.\par \par \uc2 Corporate-bond markets have been showing signs of weakness this summer, even before major stock indexes plunged in recent days. While there are no signs so far that the global stock rout is turning into a broader crisis, some analysts say the bond market often does a better job than the stock market anticipating economic turns and that investors should focus on debt-market trends for signs of when stability will return.\par \par \uc2 "Credit markets led stocks in 2000 and 2008," said James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC. He said credit spreads, reflecting companies' borrowing costs relative to the government's, have been widening, or increasing, for a year and are "showing no signs of stopping." Mr. Bianco added that "something is not right" in the world.\par \par \uc2 There are good reasons investors tended to ignore the warning signs from high-grade and junk bonds this year, despite the market's solid record of predicting problems. For one thing, stocks were climbing. And much of the troubles in corporate bonds seemed due to tumbling energy prices, which were pressuring debt of companies in that business. About 20% of the junk-bond market is made up of energy-related companies, according to some estimates.\par \par \uc2 Surging sales of corporate bonds amid low interest rates was another reason to ignore problems in the bond market. Some said price weakness was simply a result of this surge of supply. Meanwhile, investors have been favoring securities that offered higher yields than government debt and were snapping up new corporate bonds.\par \par \uc2 Still, the bond market's bearishness this year was corroborated by unease in various commodity markets, in which oil, copper and some other commodities have been under pressure for much of the year.\par \par \uc2 Now, some bond veterans say the softness in investment-grade and junk bonds was a canary in the coal mine and that bond investors, once again, have demonstrated an ability to anticipate global economic shifts better than stock investors.\par \par \uc2 "The equity market has been catching up with the sloppiness of the junk market," said Ken Monaghan, head of global high yield at \uc2 Amundi Smith Breeden\uc2 , which oversees about $9 billion.\par \par \uc2 As of Friday, U.S. junk bonds were down 0.07% on the year, a figure that reflects interest payments and price changes, according to the S&P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index. Yields have increased from about 6.5% at the beginning of the year to about 7.2% as of Friday, according to the index, indicating lower prices.\par \par \uc2 Junk bonds were down further early Monday. The \uc2 SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF\uc2 , which tracks the market, had shed 0.6% at midday, according to FactSet.\par \par \uc2 Investors have acted accordingly, yanking about $3 billion from high-yield mutual funds this year, according to Thomson Reuters unit Lipper. Should the trend continue, it would be the third year in a row that investors pulled cash out of high-yield mutual funds. Before 2013, there hadn't been a net outflow in high-yield mutual funds since 2005, according to Lipper.\par \par \uc2 Veteran junk-bond analyst Martin Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors LLC, says the high-yield market is close to fair value, but isn't at attractive levels. Junk bonds, which have yields almost six percentage points above comparable \uc2 Treasury\uc2  yields, would need to yield more than seven points before the junk market is a buy, Mr. Fridson says.\par \par \uc2 Defaults are also beginning to increase. The trailing 12-month default rate for high-yield firms globally increased to 2.4% in July from 2.3% in June, according to \uc2 Moody's Investors Service\uc2 . The oil and gas sector has accounted for a quarter of the year's defaults, with metals and mining recording 20% of defaults year to date.\par \par \uc2 "The high-yield bond market is past its prime as far as the current recovery is concerned," said John Lonski, chief financial-markets economist at \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Still, Mr. Lonski said the junk-bond market isn't "flashing red" yet. \uc2 Moody's\uc2  is predicting that the global default rate will end 2015 at 2.7%, which would be below the historical average of 4.5%. "It's more flashing amber," Mr. Lonski said. "But again, this is no time for complacency."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20150825000037"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020150825eb8p0000y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The artificial sweetener brand Splenda is changing hands, as Heartland Food Products Group agreed to buy it from a subsidiary of \uc2 Johnson & Johnson\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Financial terms weren't disclosed. Heartland said private-equity firm \uc2 Centerbridge Partners LP\uc2  assisted in sealing the deal and would become a shareholder in Heartland after the acquisition is completed.\par \par \uc2 Splenda sweetener products contain sucralose, a no-calorie sweetener. The brand, known for its yellow packaging with blue lettering, can be used as a substitute for sugar.\par \par \uc2 Johnson & Johnson\uc2 's McNeil Nutritionals unit is selling the rights to the Splenda brand that consumers buy in groceries or use at restaurants and coffee shops. \uc2 Tate & Lyle PLC\uc2 , which helped discover sucralose in the 1970s, will retain the rights to use the Splenda brand name when sucralose it manufactures is used as an ingredient in food and drink products, according to people familiar with the brand.\par \par \uc2 Many of \uc2 Tate & Lyle\uc2 's patents for sucralose ended almost a decade ago, allowing manufacturers around the world to produce the sweetener. One of those is Heartland, which already makes sucralose, as well as stevia, saccharin, aspartame and other sweeteners.\par \par \uc2 Acquiring Splenda would allow Heartland to use the brand on packaging of sucralose it already produces. The company, based outside Indianapolis, said the acquisition is expected to result in more than 100 new jobs across its manufacturing, distribution and corporate operations.\par \par \uc2 Johnson & Johnson\uc2  said that the sale was part of its ongoing strategy to concentrate on key consumer areas such as baby care, pain care and oral care. The transaction is expected to close before year-end.\par \par \uc2 The sale comes at a time of rising consumer awareness of artificial sweeteners, a $2 billion industry, according to the \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm IHS Chemical. This month, \uc2 PepsiCo Inc\uc2 . rolled out a new version of Diet \uc2 Pepsi\uc2  that substitutes sucralose for aspartame, an artificial sweetener better known as Equal and \uc2 NutraSweet\uc2 . \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2  said the change was prompted by consumer desire for aspartame-free diet soda.\par \par \uc2 A 2005 study by the European Ramazzini Foundation of Italy labeled aspartame a carcinogen, stoking consumer concern about the sweetener. But the \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2  later discredited the study and the European Food and Safety Association in 2013 ruled out any associated risk of genetic damage or cancer from aspartame.\par \par \uc2 The change at Diet \uc2 Pepsi\uc2  positioned the soda opposite aspartame-sweetened Diet Coke. \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  continues to stand by that ingredient, which helps give Diet Coke the distinctive taste that has made it the top-selling diet soda in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Sucralose remains one of the largest sweeteners by volume, but there has been increasing competition in the category from Chinese companies like Niutang Chemical Plant Co. and JK Sucralose Inc. \uc2 Tate & Lyle\uc2  this year announced it planned to restructure its sucralose division and make Splenda sucralose a \u8220\'20\'1Clow-cost and sustainable business."\par \par \uc2 Heartland's pending acquisition of Splenda for consumers could further cut into \uc2 Tate & Lyle\uc2 's sweetener sales, which declined 15% in the year ending March 31. \uc2 Tate & Lyle\uc2  sells sucralose it makes to \uc2 Johnson & Johnson\uc2 , which uses it in the Splenda packets and zip-seal pouches it sells to restaurants and grocers.\par \par \uc2 Mike Esterl contributed to this article\par \par \uc2 Write to Tripp Mickle at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150825eb8p005ek\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 How does a business software company keep growing after it has pushed into a wide swath of offices with general-purpose tools? Go vertical.\par \par \uc2 Salesforce.com Inc\uc2 ., which makes software used by salespeople to keep tabs on clients and prospects, on Tuesday announced a variant of its sales-management tools tailored for a specific industry: wealth management.\par \par \uc2 In the past, \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  has expanded from sales into other horizontal categories like customer service, marketing and business \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , all sold by subscription over the Web. The new offering, called Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, is the first fruit of an effort to target high-value industries.\par \par \uc2 The company is moving into vertical markets as revenue growth of its flagship sales software has lagged that of its newer services.\par \par \uc2 Salesforce CEO \uc2 Marc Benioff\uc2  and President Keith Block last year signaled their plans to focus on specific industries. The company has pushed to get its software into government agencies and said it was considering specialized services for health care and life sciences.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Block last week told analysts the focus on vertical industries was undertaken \u8220\'20\'1Cvery carefully and very thoughtfully."\par \par \uc2 Some other business-technology companies, including file-sharing service \uc2 Box Inc\uc2 . and human-resources software firm \uc2 TriNet Group Inc\uc2 ., also are tailoring their software by industry.\par \par \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  isn't asking brokers to ditch their existing software. Rather, it is pitching Salesforce Financial Services Cloud as a way to knit together programs that advisers currently use to, say, rebalance clients' investment portfolios or keep tabs on their financial goals.\par \par \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  officials\u8212\'20\'14echoing many brokers and financial-management professionals\u8212\'20\'14say wealth-management companies must adjust as younger people grow up and demand new kinds of services. The industry now is \u8220\'20\'1Ca bunch of 55-year-old men selling to a bunch of 55-year-old men," Simon Mulcahy, \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 's senior vice president of financial services, said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 The new software was many months in the making, Mr. Mulcahy said. The company sought extensive consultation with wealth-management firms and interviewed millennials about what they wanted from their financial and professional advisers.\par \par \uc2 Still, \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 's newest service is a work in progress. Company representatives on Monday told journalists that the name had shifted from the brand Mr. Mulcahy initially discussed, \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 Salesforce\uc2  Wealth Cloud."\par \par \uc2 Write to Shira Ovide at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:shira.ovide@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 shira.ovide@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150825eb8p00335\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Johnson   \par \uc2 813 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 August 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.   \par \par \uc2 There's a new VIP in the corporate finance department: the chief accounting officer.\par \par \uc2 These senior-level accountants have long been a fixture at large multinational companies. But, thanks to the cost and intricacies of today's regulatory and accounting requirements, their numbers have multiplied and their duties have expanded beyond managing their company's books and preparing financial statements.\par \par \uc2 "The [chief financial officer] can't individually do it all, but running the stress tests" to predict the impact of regulatory changes, "that's my responsibility," said \uc2 MetLife Inc\uc2 . Chief Accounting Officer \uc2 Peter Carlson\uc2 . "It allows [the CFO] to do more externally and strategically."\par \par \uc2 Since 2009, there's been nearly a 40% rise in the number of chief accounting officer titles, according to findings from \uc2 Russell Reynolds Associates\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Companies are "looking for a higher level of strategic chief accounting officer," said Kristi Walters, executive director of executive recruiting firm's CFO practice. They "need someone who's willing to stand up and debate or give other ideas," about the best way to balance the spreadsheet, Ms. Walters said.\par \par \uc2 As the CFO's right hand, accounting chiefs are tackling thorny issues, such as when and how to recognize revenue, or how to report to quarterly numbers to comply with both U.S. and foreign standards.\par \par \uc2 They are also taking on new burdens. Like \uc2 Metlife\uc2 's Mr. Carlson, many accounting chiefs attest to the accuracy of their company's financial filings. Their signature on these documents makes them liable -- along with the CFO and chief executive -- if the numbers turn out to be false.\par \par \uc2 Making heavy-hitting specialists more accountable for financial reporting might be having a positive effect. Since 2005, the number of large companies warning regulators that their prior financial statements might not be valid dropped 90%, according to data and research firm Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . That suggests improvement in the safeguards companies use to prevent fraud and miscalculations.\par \par \uc2 Companies are placing heavier emphasis on such internal controls since the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-governance law of 2002, "so all of a sudden you're going to have to have someone with more skills to handle it," said Don Whalen director of research for Audit \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At many companies, the accounting chief's job has broadened to include multiple types of accounting. Mr. Carlson's job at \uc2 MetLife\uc2  changed in 2010 when the company acquired a foreign life insurance unit from \uc2 American International Group\uc2  for $16.2 billion. Now, a third of \uc2 MetLife\uc2 's operating profit comes from outside the U.S. Keeping financial records that comply with accounting and insurance rules in the U.S as well as international standards adds to the complexity, he said.\par \par \uc2 So, too, does doing business with the federal government, which requires its own form of accounting, said \uc2 Barbara Niland\uc2 , CFO of shipbuilder \uc2 Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc\uc2 . This month the company promoted Assistant Controller \uc2 Nicolas Schuck\uc2 , to accounting chief.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Niland says that having a chief accounting officer frees her up to develop strategy and interact with the board and investors.\par \par \uc2 While some companies consider controllers akin to chief accounting officers, a controller doesn't always fit the bill. "I think what happened over the last 15 years is that the accounting function started to separate from the controller function," said Gary Kabureck, former chief accounting officer at \uc2 Xerox Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 During his 12 years as chief accounting officer, a separate controller focused on budgeting and planning, while Mr. Kabureck was responsible for the nuts and bolts of global bookkeeping.\par \par \uc2 He also attended every meeting of the board's audit committee and wrote more than two dozen comment letters to standard-setters such as the \uc2 Financial Accounting Standards Board\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "My job was to know the finer points of generally accepted accounting principles," said Mr. Kabureck, now a member of the \uc2 International Accounting Standards Board\uc2 , which sets financial reporting rules for more than 100 countries.\par \par \uc2 "The role needed someone diplomatic, with a backbone. I was the signing officer; I was the first one going down if things blew up," he said.\par \par \uc2 As the cost of regulatory compliance and the consequences of a slip-up mount, many companies are willing to pay six to seven figures a year for a top-notch accountant in exchange for peace of mind.\par \par \uc2 Simone Lagomarsino\uc2 , chief executive of Calif.-based \uc2 Heritage Oaks Bancorp\uc2 , said that so far this year it is spending four times as much as last year on compliance and risk management to cope with an increase in mortgage and banking requirements.\par \par \uc2 Last week Heritage promoted controller and chief accounting officer \uc2 Jason Castle\uc2  to CFO. Mr. Castle said his time as the company's lead accountant gives him a deep understanding of the controls involved in steering a regional bank in a highly regulated environment.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150825000087"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150825eb8p0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

While there are no signs so far that the global stock rout is turning into a broader crisis, some analysts say the bond market often does a better job than the stock market anticipating economic turns and that investors should focus on debt-market trends for signs of when stability will return.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CCredit markets led stocks in 2000 and 2008," said James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC. He said credit spreads, reflecting companies' borrowing costs relative to the government's, have been widening, or increasing, for a year and are \u8220\'20\'1Cshowing no signs of stopping." Mr. Bianco added that \u8220\'20\'1Csomething is not right" in the world.\par \par \uc2 There are good reasons investors tended to ignore the warning signs from high-grade and junk bonds this year, despite the market's solid record of predicting problems. For one thing, stocks were climbing. And much of the troubles in corporate bonds seemed due to tumbling energy prices, which were pressuring debt of companies in that business. About 20% of the junk-bond market is made up of energy-related companies, according to some estimates.\par \par \uc2 Surging sales of corporate bonds amid low interest rates was another reason to ignore problems in the bond market. Some said price weakness was simply a result of this surge of supply. Meanwhile, investors have been favoring securities that offered higher yields than government debt and were snapping up new corporate bonds.\par \par \uc2 Still, the bond market's bearishness this year was corroborated by unease in various commodity markets, in which oil, copper and some other commodities have been under pressure for much of the year.\par \par \uc2 Now, some bond veterans say the softness in investment-grade and junk bonds was a canary in the coal mine and that bond investors, once again, have demonstrated an ability to anticipate global economic shifts better than stock investors.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe equity market has been catching up with the sloppiness of the junk market," said Ken Monaghan, head of global high yield at \uc2 Amundi Smith Breeden\uc2 , which oversees about $9 billion.\par \par \uc2 Junk-bond prices began falling in April, decreasing roughly 5.7% from 101.1 cents on the dollar to 95.3 cents on Friday, according to \uc2 Barclays\uc2  figures. Stocks, however, kept rising. By mid-May, the \uc2 S&P 500\uc2  was up 3.5% on the year to 2130.82, though the stock index is down 11.2% since then, to 1893.21.\par \par \uc2 As of Friday, U.S. junk bonds were down 0.07% on the year, a figure that reflects interest payments and price changes, according to the S&P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index. Yields have increased from about 6.5% at the beginning of the year to about 7.2% as of Friday, according to the index, indicating lower prices.\par \par \uc2 Junk bonds were down further on Monday. The \uc2 SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF\uc2 , which tracks the market, shed 1.2% Monday, according to FactSet.\par \par \uc2 Some junk bonds have fared better than others. As of Friday, bonds from energy companies are down 10.1% this year, reflecting price changes and interest payments. But debt from junk-rated firms excluding energy are up 1.8%, according to \uc2 S&P\uc2  Dow Jones Indices. Yields on energy bonds have soared to 12.1% from 9.1% at the end of last year, but excluding energy firms, yields are a more modest 6.4%, up from 6%.\par \par \uc2 Rising yields have put a damper on bond issuance, with junk-rated oil and gas firms selling $31.2 billion in new debt so far this year, compared with $41.5 billion at this time last year. Companies in other sectors have sold $180.4 billion, compared with $183.7 billion at this time last year, according to Dealogic figures.\par \par \uc2 Investors have acted accordingly, yanking about $3 billion from high-yield mutual funds this year, according to Thomson Reuters unit Lipper. Should the trend continue, it would be the third year in a row that investors pulled cash out of high-yield mutual funds. Before 2013, there hadn't been a net outflow in high-yield mutual funds since 2005, according to Lipper.\par \par \uc2 Veteran junk-bond analyst Martin Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors LLC, says the high-yield market is close to fair value, but isn't at attractive levels. Junk bonds, which have yields almost six percentage points above comparable \uc2 Treasury\uc2  yields, would need to yield more than seven points before the junk market is a buy, Mr. Fridson says.\par \par \uc2 Defaults are also beginning to increase. The trailing 12-month default rate for high-yield firms globally increased to 2.4% in July from 2.3% in June, according to \uc2 Moody's Investors Service\uc2 . The oil and gas sector has accounted for a quarter of the year's defaults, with metals and mining recording 20% of defaults year to date.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe high-yield bond market is past its prime as far as the current recovery is concerned," said John Lonski, chief financial-markets economist at \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Lonski said the junk-bond market isn't \u8220\'20\'1Cflashing red" yet. \uc2 Moody's\uc2  is predicting that the global default rate will end 2015 at 2.7%, which would be below the historical average of 4.5%.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt's more flashing amber," Mr. Lonski said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut again, this is no time for complacency."\par \par \uc2                 Write to Gregory Zuckerman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Mike Cherney at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:mike.cherney@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mike.cherney@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150824eb8o0046s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Morgan\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  to Form Data Company; Entity would consolidate efforts to clean and store reference data, helping banks save money, sources say\b0\par\par\uc2 By Sarah Krouse  And Emily Glazer   \par \uc2 1,025 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 August 2015\par 18:31\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Wall Street is giving its data a deep clean.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group\uc2  and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  are working to create a company that will pull together and clean reams of reference data at a lower cost than what they would spend individually, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The new entity, which will create a stream of consistent data that banks use to help determine pricing and transaction costs, is the latest example of increasingly cost-conscious banks coming together to save on head count, expenses and time.\par \par \uc2 Growing pressures on bank profits are prompting the firms to seek new ways to save money, including partnerships they may haven't considered a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 The initiative is currently dubbed \u8220\'20\'1CSPReD", which stands for Securities Product Reference Data, and is likely to be launched as a new entity in the next six to 12 months, the people said. Each founding bank is investing \u8220\'20\'1Cseven figures" for the entity, the people said.\par \par \uc2 The company will work specifically with reference data on financial instruments, including identifiers like names, codes and symbols that each institution already buys. It will start with listed derivatives and equity data, with fixed income-related data added later.\par \par \uc2 The project would consolidate efforts to clean and store the vast amount of data, centralizing a function that many banks have previously done individually, with some housing data in a variety of units within their organization.\par \par \uc2 Banks typically use market data from vendors and glean it from public sources, run it through their systems and \u8220\'20\'1Cscrub" the data to get so-called \u8220\'20\'1Cgolden copies" that are consistent and ready for use across the business, one of these people said. That consistent data can help save on transaction costs across the organization.\par \par \uc2 The banks selected \uc2 SmartStream Technologies ltd\uc2 . last year after soliciting bids and ideas for the structure of the new entity from firms that provide outsourcing and other middle and back-office services.\par \par \uc2 They plan to spin off a portion of \uc2 SmartStream\uc2 's business, including some existing reference data clients, into the new entity, with the consortium of banks taking a stake.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street's largest firms have increasingly joined forces since the financial crisis to create new entities that help them save money, meet regulatory needs or challenge incumbents.\par \par \uc2 Still, these efforts often face challenges in negotiating how proprietary information will be treated and protected, balancing the interests of rival financial firms that are investing in them and working with existing vendors who fear a change in the status quo will eat into their revenue.\par \par \uc2 It is also difficult to get a majority of big banks to sign up for a utility at the get-go, because of those risks and the high cost of spearheading. Corporations have also grown increasingly wary of relinquishing control of critical data to third-party entities because of cybersecurity fears.\par \par \uc2 With revenues under pressure since the financial crisis and expenses growing as a result of new regulations, banks have sought new ways to save money by working together.\par \par \uc2 Noninterest expenses, which include salaries, investments in technology and compliance costs, at the six biggest U.S. banks by assets rose 11.9% from 2009 to 2014, according to the banks' filings. That group includes \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Data management spending has usually been in the multiple tens of millions of dollars, sometimes up to hundreds of millions depending on the size of the large bank, said \uc2 Omer Sohail\uc2 , who leads the U.S. banking and securities \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  team at \uc2 Deloitte Consulting LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The new entity will create tailored data feeds for each client using existing sources of data that firms receive from a variety of vendors. Each bank or client will continue to negotiate those data vendor relationships themselves.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  created a central system within the bank that pulled streams of reference data from all of its providers into one hub, a person familiar with the process said. The new entity will take over scrubbing reference data for the bank, ultimately feeding it back into \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 's system, as part of its cost savings initiative.\par \par \uc2 Using consistent data allows the banks to form accurate pricing for trades and can be essential for risk and compliance reviews that could arise.\par \par \uc2 This comes amid a push by large U.S. and European banks, under growing regulatory and cost pressures to collaborate more than they have in the past.\par \par \uc2 Last August, six big banks and the \uc2 Depository Trust & Clearing Corp\uc2 . formed a new entity to pull together client data to meet more stringent know-your-customer regulations.\par \par \uc2 Symphony Communications Services, LLC, is another closely watched consortium-backed project on Wall Street. A group of 14 large banks and asset managers formed the company last year, and it then{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-led-group-of-financial-firms-buys-perzo-1412176909"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 acquired instant-messaging startup}}}\uc2 Perzo Inc\uc2 . The company's secure messaging service is seen as an alternative to costly Bloomberg terminals and it is currently working to raise additional capital.\par \par \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  also previously led a collateral management initiative called \u8220\'20\'1CProject Colin" that involved several other financial services firms. The group working on that project also considered creating a new entity, but decided instead to use services from fintech startup \uc2 AcadiaSoft\uc2  earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 As part of that collateral management initiative, \uc2 BNP Paribas SA\uc2 , \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 , \uc2 Soci\u233\'00\'E9t\u233\'00\'E9 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale SA\uc2 , \uc2 UBS Group AG\uc2 , \uc2 ICAP PLC\uc2 , The \uc2 Depository Trust & Clearing Corp\uc2 . and Euroclear invested in \uc2 AcadiaSoft\uc2  in July, joining nine existing bank investors.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CRather than upgrade their internal systems individually, they are looking at what shared services can be brought to the market that can be implemented once," said \uc2 Chris Walsh\uc2 , who was named chief executive of AcadiaSoft at the time of the new investments.\par \par \uc2 Write to Sarah Krouse at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:sarah.krouse@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sarah.krouse@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Emily Glazer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:emily.glazer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 emily.glazer@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150819eb8j005pl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.   \par \par \uc2 The Newport headquarters of the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  is a nondescript office block in a windy industrial park on the outskirts of the Welsh port. For its critics, this drab location has become an emblem of the ONS's distance from economic professionals in the City and policymakers at the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  and the Treasury.\par \par \uc2 Sir Charlie Bean\uc2 , a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been tasked by the government to lead a farreaching review into the organisation after a series of controversies, from its accounting treatment of quantitative easing, to errors in key statistics to its almost universally-criticised website.\par \par \uc2 The review, billed as a move to "futureproof" economic statistics for a digital era, will assess whether the UK's statistics are relevant, robust and credible.\par \par \uc2 But within the overarching remit, Sir Charlie is tipped to make a simple geographical recommendation: the reestablishment of a high-level presence in London, in both a practical and symbolic move to bring the organisation closer to its most prominent users.\par \par \uc2 The ONS's move out the capital in the late 2000s was part of the Labour government's drive to shift large numbers of civil service jobs out of the south-east.\par \par \uc2 Most other government departments kept their policy advisers and most senior staff in London, moving only branches with specific functions. But the ONS embarked on a wholesale relocation to the Newport office.\par \par \uc2 Staff there praise the work-life balance and the surrounding countryside, but that was not enough to stop about 90 per cent of the London-based staff deciding to quit rather than move to south Wales. Many joined the Treasury and BoE, forcing the ONS to rebuild its knowledge base.\par \par \uc2 That task has been made all the more difficult in an era of dual-income households because of the lack of other large employers in Newport, say critics, meaning the ONS has struggled to recruit the right staff. Others lament the lack of once-common rotations and secondments between the ONS, BoE and Treasury, which enabled the sharing of knowledge and advice. These have dwindled to a trickle because of the long journey.\par \par \uc2 Last but not least, the financial crash ushered in an era of budgetary cuts, just as the ONS needed to adapt to the accelerating \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  movement and the switch to online services.\par \par \uc2 Investment has been squeezed and staff morale is suffering, with only 20 per cent telling the annual civil service people survey they believed their pay was reasonable compared with people doing a similar job in other organisations.\par \par \uc2 Since 2008-09, funding for the organisation has been reduced by 30 per cent in real terms, leading John Pullinger, the national statistician, to warn of a "critical need" to review the financing of statistics.\par \par \uc2 Within the old-school office shell, there are modern touches: open-plan seating, a Costa Coffee concession and posters promoting new initiatives, but senior figures recognise that more than cosmetic upgrades are needed.\par \par \uc2 In his foreword to the ONS's formal business plan - motto: "better statistics, better decisions" - Mr Pullinger warned bluntly of the risks if the organisation did not evolve. The ONS could "become irrelevant as decision makers consider that our services are no longer helpful to them" or be "unable to change fast enough to reflect the imperatives of the data revolution".\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Athow, the deputy national statistician in charge of economic data, who joined this year in a shake-up of senior management, is one of the new guard driving change. Formerly of \uc2 HM Revenue & Customs\uc2  and the Treasury, Mr Athow told the FT it was time for the ONS to "be more on the front foot", adding he hoped the Bean review would conclude the organisation was making strides but needed to move "further and faster".\par \par \uc2 Top of Mr Athow's in-tray is the requirement to make better and more efficient use of data collected by the government for other purposes. The statistical office sends out 45,000 monthly surveys to companies to gather key data that feed into the national statistics; last week it announced plans to harvest data directly from HMRC's value added tax returns, which it estimates could halve the number of surveys it needs to send.\par \par \uc2 However, progress remains agonisingly slow: the transition from paper to electronic forms is expected to take four years.\par \par \uc2 Concerns about both the new and existing IT systems are also widespread.\par \par \uc2 The other new deputy national statistician, Heather Savory, a former chairwoman of the Open Data User Group, told her first meeting of the UK Statistics Authority Board that a "complete upgrade" of the ONS technology platform was needed.\par \par \uc2 And while the ONS has established a \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  team, its pilot projects - including scraping price data from supermarkets and investigating whether geolocated data from \uc2 Twitter\uc2  can give fresh insights into internal migration - are still in the very early stages.\par \par \uc2 The question now is whether reestablishing a presence in London, improving the ONS's performance and digital presence, and focusing more on explaining numbers rather than just producing them can all be achieved without spending more money or cutting the volume of statistical output.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150818eb8i00009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc72}{\*\bkmkend toc72}\b \uc2 WSJ.D Technology: \uc2 Samsung\uc2  Tries to Revive Phone Sales --- Smartphone maker unveils pay service, bigger screens in bid to answer Apple, others\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jonathan Cheng and Ryan Knutson   \par \uc2 758 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.   \par \par \uc2 Samsung Electronics Co\uc2 . is leaning on bigger screens and a mobile payment system to try to fend off competition from rivals like \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . as it battles declining market share in a rapidly slowing smartphone market.\par \par \uc2 The South Korean company on Thursday unveiled in New York a pair of new devices, including a large-screen variation on its Galaxy S6 Edge flagship handset. So fierce is the competition with Apple that \uc2 Samsung\uc2  moved up its event by several weeks to avoid a direct confrontation with Apple, which typically plans a September event to introduce its latest iPhone.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's Galaxy S6 Edge, first launched in April, was initially a hit with consumers, but the company wasn't able to fully capitalize on the device's popularity due to a misreading of market demand and difficulties in ramping up production of curved screens.\par \par \uc2 Its latest model, known as the Galaxy S6 Edge+, is an effort to regain momentum for its premium smartphones (roughly defined as $450 or more), which drive the bulk of profits in \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's mobile division.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's mobile division has been hit hard as once-explosive growth in the global smartphone market begins to cool. In the second quarter, global smartphone shipments rose 15%, their slowest pace in six years, according to data tracker Strategy \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Even after the release of the Galaxy S6 Edge earlier this year and its flat-screen counterpart the Galaxy S6, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  suffered a 38% drop in operating profit during the second quarter from a year earlier. Its quarterly mobile profits are now less than half what they were just two years ago, at the peak of the company's mobile dominance in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Compounding the pain, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  has lost market share in the wake of last year's release of two hit Apple products, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus with its larger screen. Those products cut deeply into \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's dominant position in larger-size premium handsets -- a corner of the market that it had mostly to itself.\par \par \uc2 Strategy \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  said \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's market share fell to 21.2% in the second quarter, while Apple, and Chinese competitors like \uc2 Huawei Technologies Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Xiaomi Corp\uc2 . each gained ground.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  also formally launched its mobile-payment service, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  Pay, an attempt to compete with Apple, \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . and others on mobile payments. The service is compatible with the three Galaxy S6 smartphones and the new Galaxy Note. It will allow consumers to pay for purchases with their phones at the checkout line.\par \par \uc2 Like \uc2 Apple Pay\uc2 , the \uc2 Samsung\uc2  service relies on the traditional payment networks, allowing people to use their existing card accounts. And while Apple's offering only works with next-generation readers, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  Pay also can be used at checkout counters that use traditional magnetic-strip card readers.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2  said the payment service will launch in the U.S. on Sept. 28, after rolling out in Korea on Aug. 20.\par \par \uc2 Its new mobile offering is an attempt to ride its lead in curved screens during a year when Apple is likely to offer only incremental design changes to its existing iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices, said Daniel Gleeson, a senior analyst at \uc2 IHS\uc2  Technology.\par \par \uc2 The Galaxy S6 Edge+ brings the number of \uc2 Samsung\uc2 's flagship smartphones this year to three. \uc2 Samsung\uc2  also unveiled Thursday the Galaxy Note 5, the fifth iteration in a line of oversize smartphones.\par \par \uc2 "By bringing out a larger version of the S6 Edge, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  is trying to compete with Apple more effectively in that space," Mr. Gleeson said.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, \uc2 Samsung\uc2  also sought to reposition the Galaxy Note as a productivity-focused device for business consumers. It will offer a detachable hard keyboard, similar to the \uc2 BlackBerry\uc2 , once hugely popular among office workers.\par \par \uc2 Samsung\uc2  has also created a feature called SideSync, which allows consumers to sync messages across phones and computers using Windows or Apple's operating systems. It also teamed up with \uc2 YouTube\uc2  to launch a live streaming feature to its camera, called Live Broadcast.\par \par \uc2 The company teased the coming launch of a smartwatch, called \uc2 Samsung\uc2  Gear S2. That device will be unveiled at an event in Berlin on Sept. 3.\par \par \uc2 Both phones will be available in the U.S. and Canada on Aug. 21 and online presales began Thursday.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150814000134"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150814eb8e0003e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Wishman, the former head of its municipal underwriting desk, improperly sold new bonds to customers at prices higher than those negotiated with bonds' issuers, the SEC said. The agency said the firm's practice cost customers at least $4.6 million.\par \par \uc2 It is the SEC's first pricing-related case against an underwriter selling new municipal securities.\par \par \uc2 Edward Jones and Ms. Wishman settled without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. An Edward Jones spokesman said the firm will fully compensate the 13,000 current and former clients who were overcharged between 2009 and 2013. The firm said it cooperated fully with the SEC investigation and has taken steps to enhance its municipal-bond business.\par \par \uc2 A lawyer representing Ms. Wishman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts said the case opens a new front for the SEC's enforcement efforts in the sale of bonds backed by state and local government-related entities, showing a changing focus from problems related to disclosure to those related to pricing. SEC commissioners Luis Aguilar, Daniel Gallagher, Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar said in a statement the case illustrates the need for better rules on transparency in bond pricing.\par \par \uc2 "The Commission's recent enforcement action against [Edward Jones] involving the offer and sale of municipal bonds to retail investors highlights the need for clear rules requiring the disclosure of mark-ups and mark-downs," they wrote, urging the \uc2 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\uc2  and the \uc2 Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board\uc2  to complete rules mandating increased price transparency. "If not, we believe the Commission should propose rules to address this important issue," they wrote.\par \par \uc2 Chairwoman \uc2 Mary Jo White\uc2  said in June 2014 that the SEC would work with Finra and the MSRB on rules for increased pricing transparency, saying the importance of such disclosure was greater in the current low interest-rate environment, where brokers' compensation can measurably impact investors' returns.\par \par \uc2 "This information should help customers assess the reasonableness of their dealer's compensation and should deter overcharging," she said.\par \par \uc2 Small investors make up around 70% of the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, either individually or through mutual funds. But researchers have found that significant markups persist on municipal bonds sold to retail investors, long after similar practices in other markets have largely been swept aside by changing technology, competition and enforcement efforts.\par \par \uc2 Elaine Greenberg, partner in the securities litigation, investigations and enforcement practice at \uc2 Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP\uc2 , said the case sends a message to municipal-market participants that the SEC is on the hunt for violations of securities law or MSRB regulations in both the primary and secondary markets.\par \par \uc2 "They're really looking at all aspects of the market, whether it's disclosure, market structure or pricing," she said. Ms. Greenberg previously served as head of the SEC's specialized unit on municipal securities and public pensions.\par \par \uc2 The SEC said that Edward Jones took new bonds into inventory, then wrongly sold them to customers at higher prices.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, the firm didn't offer the bonds to its customers until secondary trading began, then sold them at inflated prices. The SEC also charged the firm with failing to adequately supervise some secondary-market trades.\par \par \uc2 The settlement includes about $5.2 million in payments to current and former customers who were overcharged, the SEC said. Ms. Wishman agreed to pay $15,000 and will be barred from working in the securities industry for at least two years. Edward Jones now discloses the percentage and dollar amount of markups on all fixed-income trade confirmations to retail customers, the SEC said.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very visible and painful warning that will put a fire under other firms that aren't fully compliant with SEC rules," said \uc2 Matt Fabian\uc2 , partner at Concord, Mass.-based research firm Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "It's important that customers have faith in the prices on municipal bonds offered for sale."\par \par \uc2 The SEC called the municipal-bond market "illiquid and opaque" in a 2012 report and called for greater protections for investors.\par \par \uc2 The report said transaction costs and markups are typically higher for individual investors than for institutions, unlike in U.S. equity markets, and some studies have shown that "the opacity of the market contributes to the relatively higher prices paid by retail investors."\par \par \uc2 Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said Thursday's move demonstrates the SEC's commitment to maintaining the integrity of the market, which he called critical to financing U.S. infrastructure such as bridges and schools.\par \par \uc2 "It also further illustrates our continued focus on the municipal market and ensuring that participants in this market follow all legal requirements," he said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Chelsey Dulaney contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150814000133"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150814eb8e0003d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In a major shift for \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., the firm is preparing to give away some of the "secret sauce" behind its trading ideas.\par \par \uc2 Goldman will soon offer clients access to more of its in-house tools, such as high-powered databases that analyze markets and manage risk, according to the firm's executives. Those proprietary systems have long been key elements enabling Goldman to sidestep market turmoil and ring up outsize profits in better conditions.\par \par \uc2 Given direct access to these tools, Goldman clients could use the technology to build their own trading systems and potentially make purchases independent of the firm.\par \par \uc2 But the firm's executives believe the upside outweighs those concerns. Goldman is betting that its clients, such as hedge funds and other money managers, will use the individual applications, or apps, to develop strategies and then execute their trades with the firm.\par \par \uc2 By deepening ties with those clients, Goldman hopes it will pick up other business from them as well.\par \par \uc2 The development has been a centerpiece of a new technology strategy developed by \uc2 R. Martin Chavez\uc2 , the firm's chief information officer.\par \par \uc2 Goldman, like other big banks, is facing a raft of new regulations and an unyielding shift toward electronic markets. Both promised to crimp profits, and the firm felt it needed to adapt.\par \par \uc2 Historically, Goldman clients could contact the firm and ask it to create customized investment strategies using its proprietary research and analytical tools. Now Goldman is rolling out the apps, that let clients access those \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  from their own desktops via a Web-based platform, the people said.\par \par \uc2 The new Web-based platform is in many ways an attempt by Goldman to bolster its technology bona fides.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, Goldman caught flak in the tech community for helping to prosecute one of its programmers for allegedly stealing trading code. That protective stance appeared to present a contrast to tech giants such as \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 ., which have opened their software to outside developers and racked up profits.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone looked to the West Coast, and saw how Silicon Valley" was sharing information and making use of their analytic capabilities, said Mr. Chavez in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Goldman plans to let clients customize the new apps and integrate them into their own systems, he said.\par \par \uc2 Most details of Goldman's strategy haven't been previously reported. Some of the apps have been available in pilot programs, but they will be rolled out more broadly over time.\par \par \uc2 Some outsiders and Goldman alumni question whether the firm will win enough client business to justify sharing more of its \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  with clients. Others, including some rivals, are skeptical Goldman will give clients complete access to its in-house tools. Some analysts and Goldman clients say the move conceptually makes sense.\par \par \uc2 "This is the business of the future," said Richard Prager, head of global trading at \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 ., the world's biggest money manager, with almost $5 trillion in assets. "Wall Street firms have got to reinvent themselves."\par \par \uc2 The first apps in development are designed to serve money managers, pensions, hedge funds and other clients of the firm's equities and fixed-income trading businesses, according to people familiar with the matter. The apps are an extension of an internal software platform, called Marquee, that Mr. Chavez conceived years ago.\par \par \uc2 Goldman also aims to create Marquee-based applications for customers of its other divisions, including investment banking, the people said.\par \par \uc2 One of the first apps, called Simon, provides tools that allow smaller brokers to create and analyze equity-linked derivatives for their retail clients.\par \par \uc2 Goldman officials have said 20 firms signed up for a pilot program that began in early 2014. That program helped more than double the firm's sales of U.S. equity-linked notes last year, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 A second app, Strategy Studio, aims to help money managers devise quantitative investments based on their views on broad economic themes.\par \par \uc2 Reuters previously reported the launch of a Marquee-based product to help clients execute block trades.\par \par \uc2 Aside from Marquee, Goldman has considered commercializing and ultimately spinning out other programs, including Lagoon, a program that allows employees to access business applications on their mobile phone securely, and Orbit, an email service, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 "We're constantly asking ourselves about all of it," Mr. Chavez said. "Is this software better for clients and the planet if it's inside Goldman? Or is it better if we extend the platform to clients, or in some cases does a spinout into open source or a company make more sense?"\par \par \uc2 Goldman's \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , headlined by a risk-management database called SecDb that will be more widely available to clients, have long been admired across Wall Street for helping make it the industry's most-profitable securities firm.\par \par \uc2 Forged in the wake of Goldman's struggles with bond-trading losses in the 1990s, and made possible by steady advancements in computer power, SecDb allowed Goldman to look across its trading and lending activities to unearth hidden risks.\par \par \uc2 The modern-day SecDb calculates 23 billion prices across 2.8 million positions and 500,000 market scenarios, Goldman President \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2  said at a June investor conference. He called the database "a significant competitive advantage."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chavez, who was promoted from co-head of equities to chief information officer in 2013, was behind the idea to share the firm's tools more broadly with clients. He says the plan won the support of firm's senior executives.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=waco20150813000020"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020150813eb8e0000b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

More than a third of daily US trading is executed away from public exchanges, and regulators are concerned that public markets may no longer reflect up-to-date information.\par \par \uc2 Exchanges say dark pools use reference prices from public markets that then lose the business. Trade sizes in dark pools have dropped to the point where they are indistinguishable from transactions on public markets.\par \par \uc2 As the list of punishments grows, operators and their users are left with an uneasy pact. Given its status, ITG's transgression is a particular blow for the industry. "As one of the largest 'agency only' asset managers, they were held to a higher standard," says \uc2 Larry Tabb\uc2 , chief executive of Tabb, a US capital markets consultancy.\par \par \uc2 ITG provides industry trading technology, and its \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  had access to many asset managers' order books, he adds. "So to hear that ITG even had thoughts of leveraging parent order information for its own gain really surprised and shocked many clients."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  settled early cases, with Pipeline and \uc2 Liquidnet\uc2  agreeing to pay fines of a couple of million dollars.\par \par \uc2 Since last year's publication of Mr Lewis's book, the crackdown has stepped up a notch. \uc2 UBS\uc2  was fined $14.4m in January and ITG is set to raise the bar. The New York attorney-general has alleged that \uc2 Barclays\uc2  favoured some high-speed traders using its dark pool trading venue while misleading institutional investors. The bank denies the allegations. And last week Hong Kong regulators fined \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  for failing to disclose information to investors.\par \par \uc2 The crackdown has stirred up debate about ways to improve the market, beyond higher standards and transparency of operators. Mr Tabb has argued for a series of technological improvements, including standardising and synchronising timestamps, and greater transparency on how client orders are routed through the system.\par \par \uc2 Many of the cases go back five or six years, so the people involved are not always at the same employer, and the slow punishment process has drawn criticism.\par \par \uc2 Another factor is complexity. "Trading algorithms have become so complicated, it is physically impossible for the head of an electronic trading desk to have full understanding of all the nuances of their behaviour 'by hand'," says Denis Ignatovich, a former \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  trader turned software entrepreneur.\par \par \uc2 "So if a developer or product manager introduces a 'feature' that, for example, unlawfully prioritises one set of clients versus another, it may take you a very long time to detect this by looking at the post-trade data alone."\par \par \uc2 Last year he co-founded Aesthetic Integration, which develops tools for banks and exchanges to verify trading patterns. But some fund managers are wondering if a fundamental change is needed so they can trade large blocks of shares shielded from banks and high-frequency traders.\par \par \uc2 A group of nine of the largest asset managers is developing a not-for-profit venue called Luminex Trading and \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  . A similar project, the Plato Partnership , is under way in Europe. The \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2  and the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  plan to introduce intraday auctions.\par \par \uc2 Auctions allow traders to place orders at particular prices. Matching bids and offers are executed in a set timeframe but the trade is not dependent on an investor's speed in the market.\par \par \uc2 Last week Norway's sovereign wealth fund said the mix of investors was changing. People were leaving investment banks for asset management, while retail investors' orders sent to broker-dealers were matched with banks and rarely touched exchanges, it noted.\par \par \uc2 But many people question whether there is enough activity from asset managers to support more venues or trading of large blocks of shares.\par \par \uc2 "I have my doubts as to how much is out there to be traded," says \uc2 Richard Balarkas\uc2 , former chief executive of \uc2 Instinet Europe\uc2 , an agency broker. "There are lot of venues that exist that could be used. \uc2 Liquidnet\uc2  and [ITG's] Posit do a good job, but they're not getting huge amounts of the market."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.ft.com/tradingroom"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 www.ft.com/tradingroom}}}\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150813eb8d0002g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Friedman   \par \uc2 680 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par C6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.   \par \par \uc2 One of the fastest-growing trends among big retail and restaurant chains in recent years has been a practice called sale/lease-backs, by which retailers sell their stores, pocket the profits and then lease the stores back from the buyer.\par \par \uc2 The transactions allow companies to cash out the value of their real-estate holdings, which have risen sharply in recent years. But they can also saddle companies with large lease expenses that can become burdensome over time.\par \par \uc2 Still, a number of companies are taking the sale/lease-back plunge. Last month, \uc2 Sears Holdings Corp\uc2 . sold 235 properties to \uc2 Seritage Growth Properties\uc2 , a real-estate investment trust, for $2.7 billion. Sears, which spun off Seritage, will lease back a majority of the acquired properties. In June, \uc2 Darden Restaurants Inc\uc2 ., the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, said it was jettisoning 430 of its more than 1,500 restaurants to a publicly traded REIT and leasing them back.\par \par \uc2 Now the sale/lease-back trend is starting to catch on with smaller entities, including health-care facilities and medical office buildings.\par \par \uc2 Consider DEC Property LLC, the owner of a 13,000-square-foot medical office building in Tempe, Ariz. In June, DEC, which is owned by seven physicians, sold the 10-year-old single-story building to Nashville, Tenn.-based \uc2 Community Healthcare Trust Inc\uc2 . for $2.8 million. An endoscopy practice, of which several of the sellers are a part, then leased back 10,400 square feet of the space to continue their practice. A school occupies the remaining space. Before the sale, the endoscopy practice locked in its lease with the sellers for five years, with two five-year options. That made the property more marketable.\par \par \uc2 "When you buy a medical office building, you're not buying the bricks and mortar -- you're buying the practice," said Colleen McPherson, vice president of the Healthcare Services Group at \uc2 Colliers International\uc2 . "This building increased in value substantially because of the lease that was put in place with the practice/tenant."\par \par \uc2 Due to the rising demand for medical care by both aging baby boomers and maturing millennials, the vacancy rate for medical office buildings is dropping, from 10.3% in 2010 to 9.6% in the second quarter of 2015, according to commercial real-estate firm \uc2 Marcus & Millichap Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At the same time, due to a flow of cash into the sector, prices are rising, from $208.11 a square foot in June 2010 to $239.94 a square foot in June 2015, according to New York-based data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 ., with average capitalization rates dropping from 8.3% to 7% over the same period. The cap rate, a valuation measure, is equal to a property's annual income divided by its purchase price.\par \par \uc2 Facilities deemed to be less risky because they are anchored by medical practices are worth even more. According to Marcus & Millichap, brand-new medical facilities with leases extending 10 years or more in strong urban locations are trading at cap rates in the low-6% range.\par \par \uc2 Medical office buildings are also perceived as somewhat recession-resistant, since demand for medical care is strong in both good economic times and bad. According to the \uc2 National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\uc2 , at the height of the recession and financial crisis in 2008, health-care REITs fared better than other sectors, with a negative return of 11.98% for the year. In comparison, the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REIT Index, which tracks all REITs, was down 37.7% that year.\par \par \uc2 But sale/lease-backs can hurt a company's bottom line. That is one reason why major hospital systems aren't selling off their portfolios to capitalize on high prices. "If a hospital sells, they incur a rent expense, which is a significant impact to their operating margins," said Mary Beth Kuzmanovich, national director of Healthcare Services for Colliers.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150812000053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150812eb8c0001a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Friedman   \par \uc2 827 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2015\par 14:36\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 One of the fastest-growing trends among big retail and restaurant chains in recent years has been a practice called sale/lease-backs, where retailers sell their stores, pocket the profits and then lease the stores back from the buyer.\par \par \uc2 The transactions allow companies to cash out the value of their real-estate holdings, which have risen sharply in recent years. But they can also saddle companies with large lease expenses that can become burdensome over time.\par \par \uc2 Still, a number of companies are taking the sale/lease-back plunge. Last month, \uc2 Sears Holdings Corp\uc2 . sold 235 properties to \uc2 Seritage Growth Properties\uc2 , a real-estate investment trust, for $2.7 billion. Sears, which spun off Seritage, will lease back a majority of the acquired properties. In June, \uc2 Darden Restaurants Inc\uc2 ., the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, said it was jettisoning 430 of its more than 1,500 restaurants to a publicly traded REIT and leasing them back.\par \par \uc2 But now the sale/lease-back trend is starting to catch on with smaller entities, including health-care facilities and medical office buildings.\par \par \uc2 Consider DEC Property LLC, the owner of a 13,000-square-foot medical office building in Tempe, Ariz. In June, DEC, which is owned by seven physicians, sold the 10-year-old single-story building to Nashville, Tenn.-based \uc2 Community Healthcare Trust Inc\uc2 . for $2.8 million. An endoscopy practice, of which several of the sellers are a part, then leased back 10,400 square feet of the space to continue their practice. A school occupies the remaining space.\par \par \uc2 Before the sale, the endoscopy practice locked in its lease with the sellers for five years, with two five-year options. That made the property more marketable.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen you buy a medical office building, you're not buying the bricks and mortar\u8212\'20\'14you're buying the practice," said Colleen McPherson, vice president of the Healthcare Services Group at \uc2 Colliers International\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThis building increased in value substantially because of the lease that was put in place with the practice/tenant."\par \par \uc2 Due to favorable demographics\u8212\'20\'14the rising demand for medical care by both aging baby boomers and maturing millennials\u8212\'20\'14the vacancy rate for medical office buildings is dropping, from 10.3% in 2010 to 9.6% in the second quarter of 2015, according to commercial real-estate firm \uc2 Marcus & Millichap Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At the same time, due to a flow of cash into the sector, prices are rising, from $208.11 a square foot in June 2010 to $239.94 a square foot in June 2015, according to New York-based data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 ., with average capitalization rates dropping from 8.3% to 7% over the same period. The cap rate, a valuation measure, is equal to a property's annual income divided by its purchase price.\par \par \uc2 Facilities deemed to be less risky because they are anchored by medical practices are worth even more. According to Marcus & Millichap, brand-new medical facilities with leases extending 10 years or more in strong urban locations are trading at cap rates in the low-6% range.\par \par \uc2 Medical office buildings are also perceived as somewhat recession-resistant, since demand for medical care is strong in both good economic times and bad. According to the \uc2 National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\uc2 , at the height of the recession and financial crisis in 2008, health-care REITs fared better than other sectors, with a negative return of 11.98% for the year. In comparison, the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REIT Index, which tracks all REITs, was down 37.7% that year.\par \par \uc2 In May, Marcus & Millichap brokered the sale/lease-back of a nine-building, 401,428-square-foot medical office portfolio that sold for $131 million. The properties, anchored by the Illinois Bone and Joint Institute, were all located in the Chicago metro area.\par \par \uc2 But sale/lease-backs can have a negative impact on a company's bottom line. That is one reason why major hospital systems aren't selling off their portfolios to capitalize on the current high prices. \u8220\'20\'1CIf a hospital sells, they incur a rent expense, which is a significant impact to their operating margins," said Mary Beth Kuzmanovich, national director of Healthcare Services for Colliers.\par \par \uc2 Still, at least one industry analyst believes the sale/lease-back trend will continue. \u8220\'20\'1CNew highs for health-care real-estate values have made sale/lease-backs and other monetization opportunities very attractive for owners," said Kevin Tyler, a health-care analyst at Green Street Advisors LLC, a real-estate research firm in Newport Beach, Calif. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople are looking at their real-estate holdings and saying, \u8216\'20\'18Hey, we're at a point in the cycle where we haven't seen these values before. Let's take some chips off the table and focus on our operations going forward.'"\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150811eb8b004jx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 One of the largest providers of massive open online courses is teaming up with several major financial and technology companies to offer new classes this fall, the latest sign {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-future-of-college-its-online-1430105057"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 MOOC}}}\uc2  providers are scaling back their ambitions to upend {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/daphne-koller-on-the-future-of-online-education-1433532321"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the world of academia}}}\uc2  to make a profit.\par \par \uc2 Coursera's new offerings are sponsored\u8212\'20\'14and partially designed by\u8212\'20\'14several major financial and technology corporations. Instead of the Great Books, they focus {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-training-gets-an-online-refresh-1412194344"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 on skills training}}}\uc2 and professional development.\par \par \uc2 The company's collaboration is the latest step the nascent online sector has taken toward monetizing its massive, global audience by trying to bridge the yawning skills gap that continues to dog the U.S. labor market. Studies show that 40% of employers in the U.S report difficulty filling jobs.\par \par \uc2 Rick Levin\uc2 , Coursera's chief executive, said the courses\u8212\'20\'14dubbed the Global Skills Initiative\u8212\'20\'14will enable companies to expand the global pool of available talent in their respective industries and help universities provide courses that are in tune with what employers want.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a natural evolution. We've found over the last year that there is tremendous demand for job-relevant skills," said Mr. Levin. \u8220\'20\'1CWe embrace bringing universities and companies together."\par \par \uc2 MOOCs were developed in Canada around 2008 and have been dominated by three providers that have teamed up with hundreds of universities to create courses ranging from introduction to philosophy to nanotechnology. Though they have drawn wide interest and grand pronouncements, they have fallen short of the hype that accompanied their birth. Courses can cost schools several hundred thousand dollars to produce and the percentage of students who finish a class has been mired in the single digits.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt's a great idea in search of a business model," said Jeff Silber, a for-profit higher education analyst for \uc2 BMO Capital Markets\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Coursera, which has received millions of dollars in venture capital and attracted 12 million students world-wide, still gives its core product away free. In 2013, the company added the option for students of buying a certificate for up to $100 to prove they had completed a course. In 2014, those single classes evolved into certifications for a series of courses and the prices went up to around $200. The new credentials will cost as much as $600.\par \par \uc2 Coursera competitors Udacity and edX already offer courses that bridge the academic and private sectors. Udacity offers certificates called nano degrees based on a series of online courses developed with input from \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 ., among other companies. EdX created a course sequence called the XSeries Programs, with the \uc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\uc2  and a consortium of about 50 companies, including \uc2 United Parcel Service Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Procter & Gamble Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Coursera's new model centers around its sweet spot: Though just one in three of its 1,000 courses are in business, computer science or data analysis, the subjects draw 61% of the company's students. Completion rates in those courses are more than double the 8% company average, a spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 The initial Global Skills Initiative classes include Essentials of Corporate Financial Analysis and Decision Making created by the \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon\uc2  and the \uc2 University of Melbourne\uc2 ; the Internet of Things in conjunction with \uc2 Qualcomm Inc\uc2 . and the \uc2 University of California, San Diego\uc2 ; and \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2  in conjunction with \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  software company \uc2 Splunk Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 UC San Diego\uc2 . Additional companies include \uc2 Cisco Systems Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . and UBS AB.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere's a huge gap between what companies need and what students are training to do," said \uc2 Rob Reed\uc2 , chief education evangelist of Splunk, adding that the potentially massive Coursera audience would help students to learn new skills that would make them attractive in the job market and raise the visibility of Splunk's products.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe want to prepare our students for life after graduation," said Jeffrey Elman, the director of technology enhanced education at \uc2 UC San Diego\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThis can help."\par \par \uc2 Write to Douglas Belkin at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:doug.belkin@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 doug.belkin@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150804eb84004v1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Until returns increase, the report concludes that "weak investment growth will remain a drag on long-term potential growth in the eurozone".\par \par \uc2 Returns on financial assets from high-quality government debt to the riskiest corporate bonds have fallen as the world's central banks, including \uc2 the ECB\uc2 , have flooded financial markets with trillions of dollars since the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Investment in the eurozone has plunged since then and has remained weak. In 2008, the year US investment bank \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  collapsed, investment in equipment and infrastructure accounted for 23 per cent of collective gross domestic product. Last year it was 19.5 per cent, according to \uc2 Eurostat\uc2 , the EU's statistical office.\par \par \uc2 Instead, many businesses have used profits to repay debt, fund share repurchases or simply build up cash piles.\par \par \uc2 German companies have almost doubled retained profits since 2006, while other eurozone companies have also increased retained earnings since 2014, with Portuguese firms leading the gain.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150810eb8a0001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

Buyers include Point72 Asset Management LLP and \uc2 Tiger Global Management LLC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yodlee's side business marks an escalation in the long-running arms race among investors who try to turn data into investing profits. Card transactions are an especially coveted example of "alternative data," a broad term for information that goes beyond traditional measurements like stock-price history.\par \par \uc2 Some of the world's most sophisticated investors analyze location data from mobile-phone carriers, cargo-ship movements and construction permits scanned in from local-government offices across the U.S. The data troves can cost anywhere from $50,000 to $4 million a year, says Gene Ekster, who has held alternative-data-related jobs since 2008.\par \par \uc2 "It used to be that you'd hire people to go out and do research or count the number of people going into a store," Mr. Ekster says. "Now there is enormous effort in analyzing data and finding tradable signals from a range of new sources. It's still in the early stages."\par \par \uc2 The information being sold and sifted is more granular than ever.\par \par \uc2 Investment firms have used Yodlee's data to compare purchases made by visitors to specific theme parks owned by \uc2 SeaWorld Entertainment Inc\uc2 ., including SeaWorld and Busch Gardens, say people familiar with the situation.\par \par \uc2 Investors can zoom in on transactions related to tickets, merchandise, food and parking. SeaWorld's securities filings and earnings announcements disclose only the company's overall revenue from admissions and "food, merchandise and other" sales. SeaWorld declines to comment.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee, based in Redwood City, Calif., hasn't publicly disclosed that it sells the data to investment firms. Before its initial public offering last year, Yodlee said it provides data for "multiple research uses," such as "to enhance predictive analysis."\par \par \uc2 The company won't identify its data-buying clients. The business is part of a larger operation that produced about 10% of Yodlee's total revenue last year, according to the company.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Yodlee (pronounced YOHD-lee) says it has "a very limited number of strategic partnerships with firms to develop more sophisticated analytic solutions."\par \par \uc2 Yodlee also says it "adheres to strict privacy standards to ensure that the transaction data in our data products is anonymized and does not contain personally identifiable or attributable information," according to a statement.\par \par \uc2 The company says banks largely remove details that could be traced back to a specific person before the data is shipped to Yodlee. Yodlee then puts the data through a separate process that scrubs out any remaining identifiers.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee says its "strategic partners" are barred from "reselling, sharing or otherwise providing the de-identified transaction elements to any party" and are "further expressly prohibited from even attempting to re-identify any individual or any Yodlee customers from the data."\par \par \uc2 Some researchers have claimed they were able to "re-identify" people in anonymized data unrelated to Yodlee through the use of other data sets.\par \par \uc2 In January, researchers from the \uc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\uc2  said in Science magazine that they could unmask roughly 90% of people in a database of anonymous credit-card transactions with four pieces of information that included date and transaction location. They used a private database provided to them by an unidentified company.\par \par \uc2 Someone trying to identify a hypothetical person named Scott from a database of anonymized card transactions would need to know only a few pieces of additional information from other sources, the researchers said.\par \par \uc2 If Scott made a purchase at a certain bakery one day and ate dinner at a specific restaurant the next day, the person probably could "re-identify" Scott from the database, according to the researchers.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee says no one can be re-identified from its data set. "There is no possibility that anyone's identity can be determined," the company says in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Peter Swire\uc2 , a privacy expert at \uc2 Georgia Institute of Technology\uc2  hired by Yodlee to review its privacy safeguards after questions from The Wall Street Journal, says the company is "doing the technical and administrative things that regulators have recommended" to reduce the risk of data being re-identified.\par \par \uc2 He says investment firms have no reason to reverse-engineer the information they buy from Yodlee because "they are not in the business of playing spy and figuring out what the transaction history of one individual or finding the name of an individual."\par \par \uc2 Investment firms say they take precautions with alternative data. "The world of data is a bit like the Wild West, and we want to and have to be on the highest of high roads with the data we process," says Mark Herr, a spokesman for Point72, one of Yodlee's biggest data buyers.\par \par \uc2 The Stamford, Conn., firm has $11 billion in assets and was formerly known as \uc2 SAC Capital Advisors LP\uc2 . In 2013, SAC agreed to plead guilty to insider-trading charges, pay $1.8 billion in fines and stop managing money for outside clients.\par \par \uc2 Point72 has a division called Aperio to find and analyze data on behalf of trading groups throughout the firm. Aperio attempts to glean insights from the "torrent of publicly available data out there," says a person familiar with Point72.\par \par \uc2 The spokesman adds that Point72 uses a compliance system to make sure the information doesn't contain any material, nonpublic or personally identifiable information.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Yodlee had revenue of $89.1 million, up 27% from $70.2 million in 2013. The company's annual revenue has nearly doubled since 2010 and is expected to climb as high as $110.5 million this year, Yodlee said in May.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee begins collecting transaction data from bank customers after they sign up to use online tools powered by Yodlee.\par \par \uc2 Some information also goes to Yodlee through a practice called "screen scraping." If a person uses a budgeting app created by Yodlee and gives the app permission to access their bank accounts using their username and password, Yodlee can capture the transaction history in those accounts.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee's clients access current and historic data through an online portal. Data available to some customers included billions of transactions since 2011 and was gathered from as many as six million "users," according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 The document said individual transactions can include any of several pieces of information, such as transaction date, location, amount and merchant name. Yodlee says that location and merchant information "occurs only in a very small percentage of the transactions reported."\par \par \uc2 Some transactions can include numbers assigned by Yodlee to individual debit- and credit-cards. That helps investors and research firms that buy Yodlee's data track spending trends, say people familiar with the use of the data.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Swire, the privacy expert hired by Yodlee, says the identification numbers sometimes can change over time.\par \par \uc2 Banks have expressed few qualms about Yodlee, saying their contracts with the company specify what it is allowed to do with customer information. Credit- and debit-card users typically grant permission to the banks when they set up their account and agree to the bank's privacy policy.\par \par \uc2 HSBC Holdings PLC\uc2  lets Yodlee use only "aggregated data that is combined with statistical information from other sources," according to an HSBC spokesman. Yodlee may not sell "individual client or \uc2 HSBC\uc2 -specific data."\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . spokesman says the data Yodlee has access to "contains no personally identifiable information." \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 ., which generated nearly 14% of Yodlee's revenue last year, says the bank "ensures all third-party vendors protect customer data at standards that meet our policies, regulatory guidance and requirements, and are in accordance with our customer privacy policy."\par \par \uc2 USAA\uc2 , which focuses on serving current and former military members and their families, doesn't permit Yodlee to "store personally identifiable information about our members," according to a USAA spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 Personal Capital Corp.'s app uses Yodlee's system to aggregate accounts so customers can see their overall net worth, cash flow, asset allocation and portfolio performance.\par \par \uc2 In response to questions about Yodlee, Saikat Maiti, Personal Capital's chief information security and trust officer, says in a statement that the firm is partners with a "third party that in the course of providing the service collects and anonymizes data that they may utilize."\par \par \uc2 After being contacted by the Journal, Personal Capital also added a new paragraph to its customer privacy disclosure that says outside firms might "be contractually allowed to rent, sell or otherwise make commercial use" of customer data.\par \par \uc2 Among Yodlee's largest customers, \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . doesn't participate in the data-selling side business. A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan says the bank doesn't give Yodlee any access to transaction-level data and doesn't allow the company to sell such data.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee was started in 1999 and focused at first on building relationships with financial institutions. The company later developed a new business helping financial-app companies help customers track their finances.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee says more than 800 organizations were using "the Yodlee platform to power their consumer-facing digital offerings" as of Dec. 31.\par \par \uc2 Banks and other financial institutions that are Yodlee customers have more than 100 million customers. Banks pay Yodlee a fee every time a customer uses a tool powered by the company.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee's largest investors as of March 31 include mutual-fund giant \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2 , private-equity firm \uc2 Warburg Pincus LLC\uc2  and customers \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  and Tiger Global. Tiger Global, with $20 billion in assets, uses Yodlee data as part of its investment research.\par \par \uc2 In May, Yodlee Chairman, President and Chief Executive \uc2 Anil Arora\uc2  told analysts and investors that the company sees itself as the "leading cloud-based financial platform."\par \par \uc2 Yodlee has a "vision to transform digital financial services by simplifying and improving the lives of anyone with a financial account," he added. Mr. Arora cited as a growth opportunity "leveraging our unique \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  assets and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  capabilities."\par \par \uc2 Transaction data is especially useful for understanding trends at publicly traded restaurant companies, clothing firms and theme-park operators like SeaWorld, according to people familiar with the matter. Share prices of such companies are tied closely to quarterly revenue, so surprises can lead to big price swings.\par \par \uc2 Hedge-fund executives and people familiar with Yodlee say its data product is one of best and priciest available to investors, reflecting a growing strategy by information gatherers to cash in on "exhaust," or data collected while doing other business.\par \par \uc2 Yodlee's data customers include the investment research arm of \uc2 Investment Technology Group Inc\uc2 ., say people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 On its website, the New York brokerage says it has access to a "daily extended consumer transaction panel of over 3 million users and anonymized transaction level data from over 4 million accounts." ITG declines to comment on the sources of its data.\par \par \uc2 Data-analysis firm \uc2 Verisk \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 ., of Jersey City, N.J., a Yodlee rival, says it doesn't sell "customer-level spending data" but analyzes it for banks, retailers and other clients. \uc2 Cardlytics Inc\uc2 ., based in Atlanta, doesn't "supply intelligence to any Wall Street firms," the company says in a statement.\par \par \uc2 At Yodlee, the data-crunching work is in such hot demand that the company has subcontracted the job of making sense of the information for some clients. The Earnest Research Co., a New York startup, analyzes data from Yodlee on behalf of certain hedge funds, say people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Earnest produces weekly reports on sales and transactions at more than 70 retail companies from \uc2 Urban Outfitters Inc\uc2 . to \uc2 McDonald's Corp\uc2 ., these people said. Yodlee declines to comment on its relationship with Earnest, and Earnest didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20150810000033"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020150810eb8a0000u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

As he prepares to tackle the question of whether the facts and figures produced by the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  are fit for purpose, Sir Charlie admits the UK is not quite "the leader of the pack" any more.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 's former deputy governor was appointed last month by Chancellor \uc2 George Osborne\uc2  to lead an in-depth review of UK economic data.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  as he calls on the statistics community to contribute evidence, he stresses the ONS is "clearly still producing top quality statistics". Yet in government circles, disquiet with its performance has been growing.\par \par \uc2 Over the past few years, the ONS has been embroiled in a series of controversies. Its accounting treatment of the proceeds of quantitative easing, which it later reversed, was criticised for artificially flattering the public finances. Errors in a range of statistics such as construction and trade led to the stripping of the national statistics "kitemark" by the \uc2 UK Statistics Authority\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It has endured scathing criticism of its website and creaking IT infrastructure, sparking concern that outside data terminals used by the likes of traders could publish the information before it was up on the official ONS site. That led to the controversial suggestion that crucial market-moving statistics might have to be released gradually to reduce pressure on its computer system.\par \par \uc2 One topic on the table is the issue of whether the ONS needs to re-establish a senior team in London.\par \par \uc2 When the ONS relocated to Newport in 2007 it lost nearly 90 per cent of its senior staff, and the team running core economic statistics suffered in particular. Many of those who left took up positions in the Treasury, the BoE or the City - which partly explains the chorus of criticism from those institutions.\par \par \uc2 Economists say one of the biggest issues since the move has been that the relationship between staff at the ONS, BoE and Treasury has been weakened because secondments between those organisations are harder if one of them is four hours away. That means ONS statisticians can no longer routinely puzzle over oddities in the data with colleagues in nearby institutions and res-olve them before mistakes are made. Jonathan Athow, the new head of economic statistics at the ONS, has said a small London team "could be helpful".\par \par \uc2 The other oft-repeated grumble is that the organisation has focused too heavily on the technicalities of data production and has lost track of what professional users actually need - how the statistics are organised and communicated. David Caplan, a former senior ONS staff member and now director of research and statistics at policy analysis firm Belmana, says: "Measuring the economy is tough, but the ONS needs to shift its attitude and understand and address users' concerns."\par \par \uc2 Sir Charlie says, "Ultimately it should be the needs of users, broadly interpreted, that determine what sorts of statistics should be produced" - leaving the door open for a rethink of what the agency's output should be.\par \par \uc2 Another large part of the review will cover whether the ONS is making use of all the possibilities of the \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  revolution, as well as figures from other government sources. Governance arrangements for economic statistics will also be examined, but Sir Charlie says he regards "the independence of the provision of statistics as a total red line. You only have to look at countries like Greece to realise what can happen if that line gets crossed."\par \par \uc2 He has established a small team, with officials seconded from the BoE, Treasury and the \uc2 UK Statistics Authority\uc2 , to help him conduct the review. The timescale is tight: Sir Charlie will publish his interim report in the autumn and the final report is due before next year's Budget, meaning the chancellor could choose to look again at resourcing for the agency, which has seen cuts of about 20 per cent over the past five years, if the review recommends more money is needed. "They have sent me quite a tough exam with not that much time to do it," he jokes.\par \par \uc2 Background\par \par \uc2 From reviews and cuts to web difficulties and errors\par \par \uc2 1981 Rayner review leads to 25 per cent cut to the Government Statistical Service.\par \par \uc2 1988 Nigel Lawson sets up the Pickford review, after concerns the strength of the boom had been mismeasured.\par \par \uc2 1996 \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2  formed, merging statistical services\par \par \uc2 2005 Gordon Brown makes ONS independent of government .\par \par \uc2 2006 After the Lyons review, the ONS moves to Newport, Wales. The next year the BoE warns MPs the relocation "poses a serious risk to the maintenance of the quality of macroeconomic data".\par \par \uc2 2009 ONS admits it has overstated by 56 per cent the quantity of high street sales since the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 2010 Government's statistics budget cut by 17.4 per cent in real terms over next five years. ONS postpones publication of all data on the national accounts for two weeks after it found "potential errors".\par \par \uc2 2011 New ONS website launched, to an outcry over difficulties in using it.\par \par \uc2 2013 ONS retains the RPI inflation index , despite accepting its upward bias. Later, the \uc2 UK Statistics Authority\uc2  raps ONS for treatment of cash flows from quantitative easing, which flatter net borrowing figures.\par \par \uc2 2014 John Pullinger, the new national statistician, puts statistics at the top of his agenda for reform at the ONS .\par \par \uc2 2015 In May, the UKSA warns that UK official trade data will remain vulnerable to errors until the ONS improves systems. In June, errors measuring inflation in the construction sector lead to an upward revision of annual growth in national income in the first quarter.

While \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , rapid innovations in technology and the rise of the sharing economy had transformed industries around the globe, official -statistics had soldiered along largely unchanged, he said.\par \par \uc2 "As an economy develops, the traditional ways of thinking about it cease to be so relevant," he said, flagging concerns that official numbers may be incomplete in the internet age, where consumers, for example, book holidays online, bypassing travel companies.\par \par \uc2 In the 1970s the UK was "probably the world leader in statistics", he said, but it was not "quite the leader of the pack now". He queried whether the UK was making best use of opportunities stemming from the "\b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 " revolution.\par \par \uc2 After years of grumbling from policymakers and economists about the quality of the national statistics, the BoE's former chief economist was appointed last month by \uc2 George Osborne\uc2 , the chancellor, to lead a root and branch review of the UK's economic statistics.\par \par \uc2 Sir Charlie believes that the traditional divisions of industrial sectors are increasingly out of date. Citing \uc2 Rolls-Royce\uc2 , which the public considers an exemplar of manufacturing excellence, but in fact makes much of its money from its services business, he said talking about manufacturing and services as distinct concepts is "often not a helpful way to think about economic activity".\par \par \uc2 Central to the review will be the question of whether the \uc2 Office for National Statistics\uc2 , which has had a rocky period amid private and public criticism about the quality of its data, can do what policymakers want it to do. Jonathan Athow, the new head of economic statistics at the ONS, said it was "a good opportunity to look to the future and ask ourselves some searching questions about what we should be doing".\par \par \uc2 Over the past few years, the ONS has been embroiled in a series of controversies - from its accounting treatment of the proceeds of quantitative easing to errors in a range of statistics such as construction and trade.\par \par \uc2 Sir Charlie said the ONS had been on a "rollercoaster" in the past couple of -decades as it had seen many shake-ups, including its move in 2007 to Newport when it lost most of its experienced staff.\par \par \uc2 Simon Briscoe, an expert on official statistics, said the review had the "potential to be supremely important".\par \par \uc2 Interview page 3\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150805eb8500002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The dollar edged higher broadly after a measure of the U.S. service sector surged in July, helping to reinforce recent signals from the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  that borrowing costs could rise as early as September.\par \par \uc2 The dollar rose 0.4% versus the yen to \u165\'00\'A5124.86 in late-afternoon trade, on track for its highest in two months. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which compares the greenback against a basket of widely traded currencies, increased 0.1% to 89.14, its highest level in about five months and just 0.2% from a 12-year high it hit on March 13.\par \par \uc2 Investors moved into the dollar Wednesday after the Institute for Supply Management reported that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ism-nonmanufacturing-survey-rises-to-60-3-in-july-1438784012"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index}}}\uc2  rose to 60.3 in July from 56.0 in June. The number soared above economists' forecast of 56.1. A reading above 50 signifies an expansion in activity.\par \par \uc2 In addition, the ISM employment index rose to 59.6 from 52.7, helping to offset a report on Wednesday by \uc2 Automatic Data Processing\uc2  and forecasting firm \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  showing that private payrolls in the U.S. increased by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/private-sector-added-185-000-jobs-in-july-fewer-than-expected-1438778175"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a fewer-than-expected 185,000 jobs last month}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Investors have been driving the dollar higher over much of the past year on wagers that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006 as the U.S. economy improves, a view supported by strong labor-market gains. Higher borrowing costs would boost the dollar's allure to investors searching for yield.\par \par \uc2 But the dollar's advance has mostly been halting since March, as weaker data early in 2015 raised doubts about the timing of the central bank's move, pushing back market expectations toward the latter half of 2015 from midyear, and even into 2016.\par \par \uc2 The market is looking to nonfarm payrolls numbers for July, which are released Friday morning, to provide more clarity on the state of the labor market and spark a renewed rally in the U.S. currency. Fed officials have recently communicated that the bar is low for a September rate increase, but a move still depends on a strong jobs reports underpinning investor conviction that U.S. labor market gains are holding.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe scope for dollar gains might be limited ahead of the payrolls number," said \uc2 Omer Esiner\uc2 , chief market analyst at the currency brokerage \uc2 Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CA decent number on Friday, say 225,000 and above, keeps September on the table and paves the way for a more meaningful and sustained rally in the dollar."\par \par \uc2 Economists predict that the U.S. added 215,000 jobs in July, a number consistent with strong job growth. The U.S. has been averaging 233,000 monthly job gains over the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Dollar bulls got a lift on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President \uc2 Dennis Lockhart\uc2  told The Wall Street Journal that only a \u8220\'20\'1Csignificant deterioration in the economic picture" {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/atlanta-feds-lockhart-fed-is-close-to-being-ready-to-raise-short-term-rates-1438709252"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 would keep him from voting for the central bank to raise interest rates}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMost investors won't make up their minds, and the Fed won't make up its mind, until they see the nonfarm payrolls data," said Daniel Katzive, head of currency strategy for North America at \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CAnd most price action this week was marking time ahead of Friday's release of those numbers."\par \par \uc2 In other trade, the dollar slid 0.2% against the euro, as the common currency bought $1.0904.\par \par \uc2 Write to James Ramage at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:james.ramage@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 james.ramage@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150805eb85005eh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

The billionaire Mr. Griffin has not just rebuilt Citadel from its crisis-era lows, but pushed it to aggressively expand into new areas -- all while he contends with a high-profile divorce that has Chicago's gossip pages hanging on every filing. As he prepares to mark Citadel's 25th anniversary later this year, Mr. Griffin sat for several interviews with the Journal's Rob Copeland to discuss his investing style, the markets today and politics. Condensed excerpts follow:\par \par \uc2 Q: Your divorce has made public some unflattering allegations about you, many of which you've denied. How do you deal with the scrutiny?\par \par \uc2 A: Long ago I had to sort of learn to have a thick skin to read some of the things you read in the papers and to also keep my ego in check when you read some really flattering things in the papers. Two-thousand eight was a failure that I had to endure. I didn't foresee the collapse of the U.S. financial system -- I just didn't see that coming -- that the U.S. banking sector would survive only because of the support and lifeline from the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2 . I then had to fight it out in the 3 years and 17 days post-08 to make back the losses that we incurred in 16 weeks. So that's a backdrop.\par \par \uc2 In the last year, it's regrettable that the strategy used by the now-withdrawn opposing counsel was to try to attack my character in my hometown. That didn't work. My actions speak louder than anything else. Let me be clear: All I really care about is my kids know that their parents love them.\par \par \uc2 Q: Tell me something about yourself that people might find surprising.\par \par \uc2 A: It drives people nuts that I take them to \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  all the time. It's the call from Ken: 'Let's go for a walk.' Everyone knows that is code for, 'We're going to \uc2 McDonald's\uc2 .' People have these images of what the successful business person is supposed to act like and be like and so forth.\par \par \uc2 Q: What is it like to see your personal life, business life and political giving become headline news?\par \par \uc2 A: For choice, I prefer not to be a public figure. I don't have Tom Cruise's good looks. I don't have a need to be on the front page of fill-in-the-blank. On my political giving, look, there's probably not a week that goes by that I don't realize the sacrifices that our forefathers made for this country. Yes, I'm involved in politics. Because frankly, if not me, who?\par \par \uc2 Q: You've given millions to back Republican Bruce Rauner for governor of Illinois, yet also boosted Democrat Rahm Emanuel for mayor of Chicago. Where do your politics lie?\par \par \uc2 A: I can't describe myself as a die-hard Republication or faithful Democrat. The distinction between our two parties in the United States is pretty narrow. We need a mayor who understands how to get through a balance sheet; it was an easy call to get behind Rahm. I want Bruce to be comfortable knowing that he's got my support however he feels it's best to use. Anyone who knows him knows you don't have influence with Bruce.\par \par \uc2 Q: Where are you leaning in the 2016 presidential race?\par \par \uc2 A: I love Walker for taking on the entrenched interests in Wisconsin. I want to see how he can do on the national stage. I think Rubio's got a really compelling message and he comes from a background that gives him real insight into the challenges that the middle class faces. I wish Jeb had any last name but Bush, because I think Jeb's track record is really good. As an American, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of family political dynasties. We don't need another Clinton and we don't need another Bush.\par \par \uc2 Q: How is Citadel dealing with the recent market volatility in China (note: interview conducted before one of the firm's accounts in China was suspended by regulators)\par \par \uc2 A: When I think about the next 10 years, we are going to have a very meaningful business in China. We've seen the government of China respond very vigorously to the issues at hand. This is the first time they've seen so much wealth disappear so quickly in such a visible way. I think they over-responded but you can understand why they did so. They just haven't experienced this before culturally as a regime. This is a very interesting moment for them. The 10-year story on China is completely intact.\par \par \uc2 Q: How is the firm doing things differently now than it did five or 10 years ago?\par \par \uc2 A: We recently hired someone with a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  background from \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2 , and one of the problems he worked on there was the routing of calls from its call center. What's the applicability of that? Amazon, as you can imagine, has endless calls every day from its customers and if they can route those calls more quickly and more efficiently the customer experience is better. The actual mathematical techniques that Amazon uses to think about that problem we think have applicability to the financial markets. It's neat.\par \par \uc2 Q: Many of your competitors are shying from calling themselves "hedge funds." Do you have ambitions for Citadel to be something else?\par \par \uc2 A: Over the years, there have been moments in time where the word "hedge fund" in the popular media has had positive connotations and negative connotations, but the word has a very strong historical anchoring to me. We're here to create wealth for our stakeholders in good times. We're here hopefully to create wealth in difficult times.\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "Citadel Is Back and in No Mood to Be Cautious" -- WSJE August 5, 2015)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20150805000050"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020150805eb850001b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

Those skills have become more valuable on Wall Street as firms try to keep up with rogue traders in increasingly complex and rapidly moving markets.\par \par \uc2 Of 101 companies publicly seeded by \uc2 In-Q-Tel\uc2  , 33 have taken on Wall Street clients in recent years, according to a review by The Wall Street Journal. A spokeswoman for In-Q-Tel declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Other companies in this field include \uc2 Palantir Technologies Inc\uc2  ., which helps government and Wall Street clients analyze their data; \uc2 Recorded Future Inc\uc2  ., which monitors the Internet for coalescing cybersecurity threats and other events; and Domino Data Labs Inc., which provides the plumbing for firms to do data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Palantir raised $450 million last week at a valuation of about $20 billion. Since 2009, it has received more than $215 million in contracts with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  , Defense Department and \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  , according to USAspending.gov, a federal site that publishes government contracts. The company, which got its start working for intelligence agencies, now says more than 60% of its business comes from commercial clients, particularly on Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 Another firm, a small technology company in Tennessee called Digital Reasoning, has counted Swiss bank \uc2 UBS Group AG\uc2  , New York hedge-fund firm \uc2 Point72 Asset Management\uc2  LLP and \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG\uc2  as customers of data-combing software the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  has been using to track down enemies of the state.\par \par \uc2 Tim Estes\uc2  founded the firm that became Digital Reasoning in 2000 during his last year of college at the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2  , where he studied philosophy.\par \par \uc2 Conceived as a company specializing in "\b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," a branch of computer science dealing with programs that can learn from data and make better predictions, Digital Reasoning struggled during its first couple of years.\par \par \uc2 But one day in 2002, Mr. Estes landed a meeting at a nearby Army base. He demonstrated an early version of the software product that came to be known as Synthesys, showing how the company's systems could read vast amounts of text and extract patterns and links not apparent to the human eye.\par \par \uc2 That led to a pilot project and an initial government contract in 2004. The system became embedded in Army systems and was used in the field in Afghanistan, according to Digital Reasoning.\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 In-Q-Tel\uc2  investment in 2011 precipitated an even bigger mandate for Digital Reasoning from a wider swath of agencies, including the CIA.\par \par \uc2 Located in a glassy office block on the outskirts of Franklin, Tenn., the firm's staff of about 100 includes more than 30 employees with top-secret security clearance. Former Wall Street researchers and young technologists shuffle in and out of conference rooms named after locations from the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.\par \par \uc2 "We see ourselves as the Darwinian outcome of billions of dollars of intelligence spending post-9/11," said Mr. Estes, 36 years old.\par \par \uc2 Digital Reasoning's government work is classified but Mr. Estes said it involves things like "figuring out the aliases of certain people that were very hard to find in the data."\par \par \uc2 Last year, Digital Reasoning raised $24 million from a group of banks led by \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2  . and \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  . So far, it has publicized contracts to assist the compliance teams of \uc2 UBS\uc2  and Point72, the $11 billion firm run by \uc2 Steven A. Cohen\uc2  that was formerly known as \uc2 SAC Capital\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Point72 uses systems from Digital Reasoning in conjunction with those from Palantir to monitor roughly one million emails, instant messages and other electronic communications every week, according to Vincent Tortorella, the firm's chief compliance and surveillance officer.\par \par \uc2 Systems from the two companies help "read, flag and risk-score emails," which are then reviewed by a compliance group composed of former employees of the CIA, \uc2 FBI\uc2  , \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  and the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  , he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cohen's firm has been caught in regulators' cross hairs in recent years for issues related to its oversight of employees. In 2013, SAC agreed to plead guilty to insider-trading charges, pay $1.8 billion in fines and stop managing money for outside clients. Mr. Cohen is still awaiting the outcome of a civil case for failure to supervise employees later found guilty of insider trading.\par \par \uc2 UBS\uc2  , \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  and \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 In pitching prospective clients, Digital Reasoning often shows a demonstration of how its system responded when it was fed 500,000 emails related to the \uc2 Enron\uc2  scandal made available by the \uc2 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 After being "taught" some key concepts about compliance, the Synthesys program identified dozens of suspicious emails in which participants were using language that suggested attempts to conceal or destroy information. In some instances the program detected a lack of "business confidence," which in the \uc2 Enron\uc2  case was primarily related to accounting practices.\par \par \uc2 The Synthesys system reads all the text files in a database, capturing metadata and creating links between people and institutions. Words are given sentiment scores to help detect emotion. The end result is an application that can be used to look at the data from many perspectives.\par \par \uc2 With training, the system can identify situations in which people are using code words for something nefarious, said \uc2 Matthew Russell\uc2  , the firm's chief technology officer and a former intelligence officer in the \uc2 U.S. Air Force\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 For example, an extremist group might refer to bombs as wedding cakes and bombings as weddings. In finance, the system might look for "gift-giving" language, such as a discussion of seats at a sporting event or other event. The software might also monitor for attempts to conceal information, phrases that seem to be pressuring someone to do something or expressions of anger. Some institutions search for words or phrases that show a lack of confidence around a decision, which could suggest they are wading into gray area.\par \par \uc2 Digital Reasoning is already in discussions with financial clients about the next phase of analysis after compliance solutions: increasing revenue.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Dwoskin contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20150804000028"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020150804eb840000q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

DeWeaver   \par \uc2 831 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 August 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Europe\par \uc2 WSJE\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   \par \par \uc2 China's stock-market crash has raised fears of global contagion not witnessed since the 2008 financial crisis. Such fears are misplaced. Dropping share prices, even to the extent seen last week, doesn't mean Beijing won't hit its 7% GDP growth target or will abruptly cease implementing its ambitious monetary and fiscal stimulus programs.\par \par \uc2 On June 27, the \uc2 People's Bank of China\uc2  announced a 25 basis-point interest-rate cut -- the fourth such cut since November. But lowering interest rates is a relatively ineffective way to stimulate the Chinese economy. China's state sector, which still accounts for a large share of economic activity, isn't sufficiently interest-rate sensitive for standard monetary-policy tools to work well.\par \par \uc2 Rather, it is Beijing's recent moves to ease fiscal policy that will ensure that this year's growth target can be met. Unlike traditional Keynesian stimulus programs, which are typically conducted at the central-government level, in China fiscal easing primarily involves providing additional state-bank money to local governments.\par \par \uc2 This has a more immediate and powerful effect on GDP growth and job creation, but it comes at a high cost: overinvestment in local projects and the misallocation of capital. China's landscape is littered with unused highways and airports, redundant steel and cement plants, unnecessary municipal office buildings and "ghost cities" filled with empty high-rises and deserted shopping malls.\par \par \uc2 From 2009 to 2013, "ineffective investment" amounted to a stunning 41.8 trillion yuan ($6.742 trillion), according to research published in 2014 by Xu Ce of \uc2 China's National Development and Reform Commission\uc2  and Wang Yuan of the Academy of Macroeconomic Research.\par \par \uc2 That China is heading down this path again can only mean that it has no other way to reach its growth target. It is also an indication of how little the economic system has changed despite the leadership's much-vaunted reform initiatives and efforts to tackle corruption at all levels of government.\par \par \uc2 Local governments have been under increased stress since the global financial crisis, when many of them borrowed large amounts to pay for a variety of fixed-asset investments. This spending helped China to keep growing even as year-over-year export growth plummeted to minus 25.7% in February 2009 from 19.2% in June 2008. It also left behind a mountain of debt that many localities have had trouble servicing. The \uc2 Chinese Academy of Social Sciences\uc2  recently put total year-end 2014 local government debt at 30.3 trillion yuan.\par \par \uc2 In March the \uc2 Ministry of Finance\uc2  announced a plan to alleviate the problem by allowing regional authorities to issue bonds directly for the first time. So far bonds worth 2 trillion yuan have been authorized -- the first trillion in May and a second trillion in June. As of July 15, 1.2 trillion yuan in bonds had already been issued. While not a large percentage of the total amount local governments owe, these offerings will greatly enhance their solvency by providing funds to repay loans due this year.\par \par \uc2 On May 11 the State Council, China's cabinet, also issued a notification requiring the banks to "actively support" existing local projects. At the same time, a number of ideas for new investment spending are now under consideration. A recent article in the China Securities Times identified 10 provinces that had proposed "economic stability" measures since the beginning of May. These will rely heavily on infrastructure investment, which, as of the first half of 2015, is already up 19.1% year on year.\par \par \uc2 In addition to infrastructure, the localities are considering investments related to Beijing's "Internet Plus" strategy, which envisages a transformation of the Chinese economy based on cloud computing, \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , mobile applications and the fast-growing connected-devices market known as the Internet of things.\par \par \uc2 The term Internet Plus was first introduced by Premier \uc2 Li Keqiang\uc2  in his report to the annual session of the National People's Congress in March. While there have been many official pronouncements on this subject since then, it is still unclear what the new policy will entail.\par \par \uc2 A State Council executive meeting on June 24 approved a wide range of priority areas, covering everything from logistics and smart grids to environmental protection and the modernization of agriculture. Officials appear to have been given a broad mandate to invest in practically anything that can be justified as Internet related.\par \par \uc2 This year local government projects are set to make a major contribution to keeping China's GDP growth on target. Once again, however, much of the new investment will be inefficient, contributing to the country's already considerable stock of underutilized infrastructure while perhaps introducing novel species of IT white elephants as well.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeWeaver is manager of the emerging markets fund Quantrarian Asia Hedge and the author of "Animal Spirits With Chinese Characteristics" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20150803000046"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020150803eb8300017\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

In performance, it ranks 61st out of 79 in its sector over the past year, figures from FE \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  show.\par \par \uc2 The underperformance was "primarily because of the short-duration positioning which held back returns at a time when European government bonds saw sharp yield compression," said \uc2 Jason Hollands\uc2 , managing director at the wealth manager Tilney Bestinvest.\par \par \uc2 Performance has recovered more recently, Mr Hollands added. Over the past three months, the fund ranks 34th in its category; over a five-year period, its performance remains top-quartile.\par \par \uc2 M&G said it would not comment on fund flows.\par \par \uc2 M&G Optimal Income , an unconstrained vehicle that can rove through global bond markets and can also buy equities, was the UK's best-selling retail fund last year despite a 3 per cent entry fee.\par \par \uc2 Investors were drawn to its flexibility and strong nine-year record amid uncertain bond markets, but performance suffered in the past year from a decision to shorten duration, or sensitivity to interest rates, in preparation for rate rises that have not yet materialised. This meant the fund did not take part in a government bond rally last year.\par \par \uc2 The big outflows were partly due to the fund's popularity with continental European retail investors, who tend to move money rapidly in response to performance, said Juliet Schooling Latter, research director at \uc2 Chelsea Financial Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "M&G is suffering more than other strategic bond funds," she added. The M&G fund made up the lion's share of outflows from the strategic bond sector, according to the Investment Association, while investors also pulled \u163\'00\'A3536m from corporate bond funds.\par \par \uc2 The product has, meanwhile, faced criticism over its ballooning size . \uc2 Jake Moeller\uc2 , head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, said: "Those guys are excellent bond fund managers, but when you've got 1,500 securities in a bond fund, it's too many. You will approach an index position. It becomes much harder to outperform - that's true of any fund."\par \par \uc2 Mr Woolnough told an interviewer at \uc2 Fidelity\uc2  Personal Investing in May: "The larger a fund is, then by definition it makes it harder to add individual stock selection ideas. But it also depends what the purpose of the fund is.\par \par \uc2 "Investors should be aware that the larger a fund gets, the harder it gets to add value in individual stock selection, and that's something we've faced over the last 10 years."\par \par \uc2 Mr Woolnough has been identified as the highest-paid employee of \uc2 Prudential\uc2 , M&G's parent company, and company documents say he was paid more than \u163\'00\'A315m in each of the past two years.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150801eb810002j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Energy prices' slide accelerated, declining 5.6 per cent in July compared with a 5.1 per cent drop the previous month.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, inflation in services hit its highest level in a year at 1.2 per cent, with analysts at \uc2 Barclays\uc2  suggesting that "technical factors", such as package holidays and airfare bookings, were behind some of this increase.\par \par \uc2 The overall estimate of 0.2 per cent was in line with expectations, although some analysts had pencilled in a return to very modest deflation this month.\par \par \uc2 Others were bullish that inflation would creep up. Tomas Holinka, an economist at \uc2 Moody's\b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said: "Inflation should gather momentum in coming months as oil deflation eases and food price growth gains ground."\par \par \uc2 Inflation has been sluggish even in fast-growing economies such as Spain , which this week recorded expansion of 1 per cent quarter on quarter. Consumer prices in the country dipped 0.1 per cent year on year during July.\par \par \uc2 Unemployment remained stable at 11.1 per cent across the eurozone in June, according to \uc2 Eurostat\uc2 . Big falls in unemployment in Spain and Portugal were drowned out by worsening figures in Italy, Belgium and Austria.\par \par \uc2 Italy's unemployment climbed to 12.7 per cent in June from 12.5 per cent in May, delivering a blow to hopes that the nascent recovery in the eurozone's third-largest economy could bring some relief to its labour market.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, youth joblessness in the country increased to 44.2 per cent, its highest level since 1977 and roughly twice the eurozone average.\par \par \uc2 The discouraging data could hurt the government of \uc2 Matteo Renzi\uc2  , which has been hoping that its aggressive economic reform agenda could start delivering a brighter economic outlook for most Italians. But, so far, only pockets of the Italian economy have benefited from the country's tepid rebound.\par \par \uc2 Finland endured an even worse performance, with unemployment jumping from 8.6 per cent to 9.5 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Across the EU as a whole, unemployment remained static at 9.6 per cent in June.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150801eb810000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

The delivery giant has been working on reducing costs after tough back-to-back holiday seasons damped profit.\par \par \uc2 A prized addition to \uc2 UPS\uc2 's portfolio will be Coyote's proprietary technology, Mr. Gershenhorn said. The company will use it to make better use of its fleet of long-haul trucks, some of which at times drive empty between warehouses or package-sorting hubs. Filling that space should boost efficiency and revenue. \uc2 UPS\uc2  will also offer its customers use of the technology to fill out their own trucks.\par \par \uc2 Founded in 2006, Coyote was an early entrant into a new world of freight that used the promise of combining technology and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to win the business of retailers and manufacturers.\par \par \uc2 Founder \uc2 Jeff Silver\uc2  said Coyote hires young employees with no experience in transportation and trains them on an electronic platform that connects brokers and customers. The software helps spot where shipping needs of customers overlap, allowing brokers to find space on trucks more easily and to offer cheaper prices in buying the capacity, Mr. Silver said.\par \par \uc2 "We become a network integrator for our customers," he said. "It gets us out of the role of just being a traditional broker."\par \par \uc2 Coyote's technology has helped it rise quickly in a competitive, yet highly fragmented, market. The company booked $2.1 billion in revenue last year, according to \uc2 UPS\uc2 . According to Armstrong & Associates, a research firm, Coyote ranks 17th by revenue among third-party logistics providers, a wider universe of companies that also includes freight brokers. \uc2 UPS Supply Chain Solutions\uc2  ranked fourth with $5.76 billion in revenue, though it had largely steered clear of freight brokering before Friday's deal.\par \par \uc2 In a separate matter, \uc2 UPS\uc2  rival \uc2 FedEx Corp\uc2 . hit a bump with its planned acquisition of \uc2 TNT Express NV\uc2 . The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  on Friday opened an in-depth investigation into \uc2 Fedex\uc2 's nearly $5 billion deal for the Dutch delivery company, saying it was concerned about the merged company's dominance in international delivery in some markets.\par \par \uc2 The regulator said it would take until early December to decide whether it will approve the deal or ask for concessions to ease its concerns. The two other large international delivery companies, \uc2 UPS\uc2  and \uc2 DHL Worldwide Express Inc\uc2 ., may not provide sufficient competition to the merged company, the antitrust watchdog said.\par \par \uc2 On its earnings call in June, \uc2 FedEx\uc2  executives said they did "not believe that the transaction faces any competition issues for the Commission." A similar attempt to acquire TNT by \uc2 UPS\uc2  collapsed in 2013 when it failed to satisfy European regulators.\par \par \uc2 TNT Express\uc2  said in a release that the extended review by the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  is customary. Analysts said the review wasn't surprising and had been largely expected by the market.\par \par \uc2 FedEx\uc2  said it continues to make progress on regulatory steps, which would allow it to complete the transaction in the first half of 2016. "We will continue to work together with \uc2 TNT Express\uc2  to meet the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 's need for additional due diligence and are confident that the combination of both companies will increase competition and create benefits for customers," said \uc2 Patrick Fitzgerald\uc2 , senior vice president integrated marketing and communications at \uc2 FedEx\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As delivery companies look for growth, third-party logistics providers like Coyote are becoming more attractive. Revenue from those U.S. logistics providers rose 7.4% to $157.2 billion last year, faster than the 2.8% growth in logistics spending overall, according to research firm Armstrong & Associates.\par \par \uc2 FedEx\uc2  acquired logistics company \uc2 GENCO Distribution System Inc\uc2 ., a company that specializes in product returns, for $1.4 billion earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Europe has also become increasingly attractive for growth. \uc2 UPS\uc2  has said it is doubling its investment there to nearly $2 billion over five years, while \uc2 XPO Logistics Inc\uc2 . earlier this year said it was purchasing French contract-logistics firm \uc2 Norbert Dentressangle SA\uc2  in a deal valued at $3.53 billion.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Gabriele Steinhauser contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150801000130"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150801eb810003i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Cohen\uc2  continued its push into the world of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , hiring the former co-head of research at hedge-fund giant \uc2 Bridgewater Associates LP\uc2  to be its new chief market intelligence officer.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Granade, 38 years old, will oversee Point72 Asset Management LP's data sourcing and analysis efforts. He said in an interview that he decided to join the firm after Mr. Cohen and Point72's president, Douglas Haynes, extolled the firm's efforts in data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Steve explained that this was the way the firm needs to evolve," he said. "My personal feeling is that this is a very exciting time in this space. Investing now isn't just about earnings estimates and 10ks. It's about satellite imagery, sensors and mobile devices. The more you can process those things, the more edge you'll have."\par \par \uc2 Formerly known as \uc2 SAC Capital Advisors LP\uc2 , Point72 has been trying to distance itself from its past since SAC agreed in 2013 to plead guilty to insider-trading charges, pay $1.8 billion in fines and stop managing money for outside clients. The firm also lost much of its senior investment staff, and Mr. Cohen still is awaiting the outcome of a civil case from the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  for failure to supervise employees later found guilty of insider trading.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cohen long has been known as a stock picker who makes major decisions on his own, even while the firm invested in new analytical tools. It isn't clear how much these efforts have changed its investment approach.\par \par \uc2 Point72's dive into data comes at a time of growing interest among Wall Street firms into how to find profit-driving information from torrents of data.\par \par \uc2 So-called quantitative investment firms, such as $25 billion \uc2 Two Sigma Investments\uc2 , long have been big consumers of data. Such firms use mathematics to sift through huge amounts of data for clues about the direction of stock prices or futures contracts. They analyze everything from social-media sentiment to satellite imagery that shows them how many cars are in parking lots of big retailers.\par \par \uc2 Investment firms that focus on more-traditional measures of companies' health also have sought to increase their use of sophisticated data. Oil investors for years have bought expensive information from companies that fly helicopters over storage facilities with infrared cameras that help detect the volume of oil stored inside.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Granade said new types of data have been emerging with greater frequency.\par \par \uc2 For example, after he left Bridgewater Mr. Granade served as an adviser to Orbital Insights Inc., a firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that has designed systems to analyze satellite images for useful information.

Its value is 30 per cent larger than Melrose's market capitalisation before the announcement.\par \par \uc2 Melrose bought Elster for \u163\'00\'A31.8bn in August 2012, including an infusion of \u163\'00\'A31.2bn from shareholders, and boosted its operating margins from 12.8 to almost 20 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Simon Peckham , chief executive, said the price represented "a good deal for both parties". "We've done lots of work to [Elster] but there's more to do," he said.\par \par \uc2 Melrose's shares jumped to 295p in early trading before falling back to 279p, up 24.7p and a 9.71 per cent gain on Monday's close.\par \par \uc2 Mr Peckham said Melrose would look for acquisition targets, particularly in North America and northern Europe. "The requirement is good quality industrial businesses that aren't quite fulfilling their potential," he said, without identifying anything specific.\par \par \uc2 The exact amount that shareholders will receive has yet to be fixed. Melrose plans to pay off some \u163\'00\'A3750m in debt, plus fees and long-term incentives to Elster management. The group also intends to keep some of the purchase price to meet operating expenses.\par \par \uc2 Analysts at Investec, Melrose's broker, estimated shareholders might receive as much as \u163\'00\'A32.3bn.\par \par \uc2 If they do, Melrose board members, who own 3.65 per cent of the company, are set to take home more than \u163\'00\'A384m on completion, expected in the first quarter of 2016.\par \par \uc2 A person with knowledge of the deal said \uc2 Honeywell\uc2  had been "hovering for some time" but that the acquisition process was "fairly rapid".\par \par \uc2 Elster employs 6,800 people and operates in 39 countries, with its main operations in the US, Germany, the UK and Slovakia.\par \par \uc2 Dave Cote\uc2  , \uc2 Honeywell\uc2 's chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition would "generate strong returns for \uc2 Honeywell\uc2 's shareholders because it increases our growth profile globally" and Elster's growth can be accelerated.\par \par \uc2 The sale price implies a valuation of 3.1 times 2014 revenue and 14.3 times 2014 headline earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to Melrose.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cote said \uc2 Honeywell\uc2  was attracted to Elster because utility metering was "rapidly evolving as new 'smart' technologies and software and data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  capabilities are being adopted around the world".\par \par \uc2 He added that Elster "creates a new platform for acquisition targets for \uc2 Honeywell\uc2 ".\par \par \uc2 Melrose's sole remaining asset is Brush Turbogenerators, a manufacturer of generators for steam and gas turbine applications. Melrose cautioned yesterday that "current trading conditions remain challenging for Brush". But it expected a better second half.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Miller\uc2  , Melrose's executive chairman, said that in the 10 years since its first investment the company had created more than \u163\'00\'A32bn of shareholder value.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LONDON\u8212\'20\'14Private-equity firm \uc2 Lone Star Funds\uc2  is making a big bet on London's residential market with the acquisition of \uc2 Quintain Estates & Development PLC\uc2 , a developer that owns the land around Wembley Stadium, for \u163\'00\'A3700 million ($1.09 billion).\par \par \uc2 Lone Star on Wednesday said it would pay 131 pence a share for Quintain, representing a 22.4% premium on its closing price Tuesday, and prompting shares in the U.K.-listed business to soar to their highest level in more than seven years.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe proposed acquisition represents a unique opportunity for Lone Star to gain further exposure to residential and commercial assets in London," said Angus Dodd, managing director at Lone Star Europe.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dodd added that the Dallas-based firm would use its funds to speed up Quintain's building plans to take advantage of London's property boom.\par \par \uc2 Figures released by the U.K.'s Land Registry on Tuesday showed house price growth in the capital continues to outpace the rest of the U.K., with average growth of 1.8% in June compared with 1.1% across the country. Average prices gained 9.2% to \u163\'00\'A3481,820 in the 12 months through June, compared with 5.4% across the U.K.\par \par \uc2 Quintain is developing an 85-acre site around the storied Wembley Stadium, which hosts the England soccer team, rock concerts, and regular National Football League fixtures.\par \par \uc2 In a bid to spruce up the formerly shabby neighborhood, Quintain built a retail complex before it started selling apartments, targeting buy-to-let investors and young professionals rather than the richest buyers. Much of the land remains undeveloped. Overall, Quintain, whose board is recommending Lone Star's offer, plans to build around 5,000 homes over the next 10 years.\par \par \uc2 Lone Star is the latest North American investor to push into the London property market, despite warnings from some analysts that the market looks overheated.\par \par \uc2 Of the $26.6 billion invested into the U.K. capital from overseas so far this year, around $11 billion has come from the U.S. and Canada, according to \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a data firm.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, Qatar's state investment fund and Canadian firm \uc2 Brookfield Property Partners LP{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brookfield-qatar-fund-take-control-of-londons-canary-wharf-1425407733"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 paid \u163\'00\'A32.6 billion for the largest shareholder}}}\uc2 in London's \uc2 Canary Wharf\uc2  business district, where construction of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/articles/buyers-queue-up-for-canary-wharf-condos-1436866381"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 new high-end residential towers}}}\uc2  is under way.\par \par \uc2 For Lone Star, the Quintain deal is its second big move in U.K. real estate this month, having earlier said it would bundle 89 U.K. hotels it already owns into a new company, Amaris Hospitality, which it plans to float on the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For Quintain, the deal follows its rehabilitation following the financial crisis, during which it had to issue equity to stay afloat as London's property values plunged. Since then, it has sold a string of assets, including a development project in Greenwich that was acquired by Hong Kong billionaire Henry Cheng Kar-shun, and concentrated its development activity on Wembley.\par \par \uc2 Analysts at broker \uc2 Liberum Capital\uc2  said Lone Star's offer price understates Quintain's long-term earnings potential, but predicted that shareholders would nevertheless seize the chance to cash in before London's property market changes course again.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ed Ballard at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ed.ballard@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ed.ballard@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Art Patnaude at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:art.patnaude@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 art.patnaude@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150729eb7t004pi\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Martin   \par \uc2 500 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par C3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.   \par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  is fetching a bigger price tag.\par \par \uc2 McGraw Hill Financial Inc\uc2 . agreed to buy \uc2 SNL Financial\uc2  LC for $2.2 billion in a deal announced Monday, nearly five times what the financial-data provider was worth four years ago when private-equity firm \uc2 New Mountain Capital LLC\uc2  purchased a 60% stake.\par \par \uc2 New York-based McGraw Hill outmaneuvered a handful of media and financial-data companies in its pursuit of SNL, based in Charlottesville, Va., according to people familiar with the matter. The pursuers included \uc2 Hearst Corp\uc2 ., which has a majority ownership stake in bond-rating firm \uc2 Fitch Ratings\uc2 , as well as financial-data provider \uc2 FactSet Research Systems Inc\uc2 ., according to a person familiar with the matter. A Hearst spokesman declined to comment. A FactSet spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Investors weren't pleased with the multiple McGraw Hill agreed to pay, driving shares down 5.7%, or $5.99, to $99.59.\par \par \uc2 Analyst Timothy McHugh of \uc2 William Blair & Co\uc2 . said the price for SNL "is probably a little high," in a Monday note to investors. Another, William Bird of \uc2 FBR Capital Markets & Co\uc2 ., said "the stock reaction seems exaggerated." Mr. Bird estimated the multiple paid by McGraw Hill was more than 43 times SNL's 2015 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $51 million.\par \par \uc2 McGraw Hill Chief Financial Officer Jack Callahan acknowledged SNL "was certainly not cheap" but said his company's sales staff outside of the U.S. could help broaden SNL's reach faster.\par \par \uc2 McGraw Hill's tie-up with SNL caps a string of pricey deals for data-driven companies as the market for firms selling obscure financial intelligence on banks, commodities and real estate attracts a bigger audience and entrenched firms look to expand.\par \par \uc2 Carlyle Group LP\uc2  and other investors last year agreed to acquire Dealogic, a financial-data provider, for about $700 million. In March, a consortium led by Carlyle and \uc2 Warburg Pincus LLC\uc2  bought ratings firm \uc2 DBRS Ltd\uc2 . for more than $500 million based, in part, on the promise of its ability to sell financial intelligence to banks and other investors. More transactions are expected as other firms rush to meet the data demand.\par \par \uc2 Financial-data and transactions giants \uc2 First Data Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 SunGard\uc2  recently filed for initial public offerings, and \uc2 SunGard\uc2  has had suitors express interest in an acquisition, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Shares of TransUnion, the credit bureau, are up 10% since their IPO debut last month.\par \par \uc2 "There's an increasing demand for data, research and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  in the financial and corporate markets," said \uc2 Douglas Peterson\uc2 , McGraw Hill's chief executive and a former \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . officer, in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Separately, McGraw Hill reported that second-quarter profit grew to $353 million, or $1.28 a share, from $292 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20150728000096"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020150728eb7s0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw276\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4140\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc96}{\*\bkmkend toc96}\b \uc2 So Long Wall Street, Hello Silicon Valley\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ryan Dezember and Vipal Monga   \par \uc2 998 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2015\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Europe\par \uc2 WSJE\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 (Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   \par \par \uc2 More top Wall Streeters are California dreaming.\par \par \uc2 A technology-fueled gold rush is drawing seasoned financial executives with the promise of sunshine, fresh managerial challenges and compensation that can top even the seven-figure paychecks common in the investment world.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2  said Friday that its chief financial officer, \uc2 Laurence Tosi\uc2 , is leaving the private-equity firm to become finance chief at \uc2 Airbnb Inc\uc2 ., the booming home-rental service. He is just the latest Wall Street executive to move west to take advantage of massive investor interest in fast-growing companies seeking to upend entire swaths of the economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tosi, 47 years old, has made a good living by any standard since he joined \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  following its 2007 initial public offering. He earned about $15 million last year, according to filings, and $33.8 million over the past three years, not including dividends and some other perks, such as proceeds from investments made in the firm's funds.\par \par \uc2 Yet those sums will likely appear paltry next to his winnings should \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  pull off a successful IPO in coming years, as many analysts expect.\par \par \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 , a seven-year-old San Francisco company, is working to complete private funding arrangements that value it at $25.5 billion. Mr. Tosi's pay arrangements there aren't known, but he is expected to receive an equity stake in the firm that could be worth tens of millions of dollars following an IPO.\par \par \uc2 Beyond pay, joining fast-growing technology firms can offer other goodies. Away from the shadows of Wall Street, executives can find a higher profile and increased freedom.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Noto\uc2  left \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . a year ago and became finance chief at \uc2 Twitter Inc\uc2 ., the messaging service that the stock market values at $23.7 billion. \uc2 Ruth Porat\uc2  traded \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  for \uc2 Google Inc\uc2 . \uc2 Vanessa Wittman\uc2 , formerly of insurer \uc2 Marsh & McLennan Cos\uc2 ., is at cloud-storage company \uc2 Dropbox Inc\uc2 ., another business valued in the billions of dollars in private financings.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Porat was wooed by \uc2 Google\uc2  with a compensation package worth around $70 million, including a one-time bonus and new-hire stock grants. That was more than twice what she took home in total during her previous three years at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , according to securities filings.\par \par \uc2 The investment appears to be paying quick dividends for the Internet search giant. Strong quarterly earnings released earlier this month jolted its shares, making \uc2 Google\uc2  worth $65 billion more overnight. Some analysts partially credited Ms. Porat's May arrival at \uc2 Google\uc2  with market-pleasing belt-tightening that was evident in the results.\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2 's stock-market value is more than $400 billion, compared with \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's $78 billion.\par \par \uc2 Technology firms' rise have forced Wall Street to rethink its ways in the name of keeping scarce talent. Some private-equity firms have backed off policies that force their newest hires to obtain M.B.A.s, partly because technology startups and venture-capital firms offer Ivy Leaguers attractive alternatives that often consider expensive business degrees optional.\par \par \uc2 Several Wall Street firms have adopted rules aimed at reducing the famously long hours spent in the office by their latest recruits to combat burnout and attrition.\par \par \uc2 Wall Street recruiters and executives say technology companies have boosted competition for workers of all ranks. "There's no border on industries any longer," said \uc2 Michael Goodman\uc2 , managing partner of \uc2 Long Ridge Partners\uc2 , which recruits employees for investment firms. "Smart is smart."\par \par \uc2 Still, these moves don't always work out. Greg Smithies decamped for Silicon Valley in 2010, disillusioned with the financial industry after its near collapse. He left \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 . to join a venture investing firm. Now, Mr. Smithies is back in New York, working at a three-year-old data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm.\par \par \uc2 "On the West Coast, you see a lot of news reports of startup founders becoming billionaires before they're 40," the 31-year-old said. "People want to live the dream, but the reality is that you'll end up at a startup and make between $100,000 and $150,000 a year as an engineer, and the startup will go under."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tosi's own Silicon Valley gambit isn't without risk. \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 's business model, which allows private owners to rent properties for short stays, has met resistance from some lawmakers, and past Internet booms have shown that technology-company valuations can shrivel as dramatically as they balloon.\par \par \uc2 In part, Mr. Tosi's decision gives him another chance to swing for the fences. He became \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 's CFO in 2008, shortly after the firm's stock-market debut, and helped steer its rise to becoming one of Wall Street's marquee firms. \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  manages about $333 billion on behalf of pensioners, endowments and the wealthy.\par \par \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  began its courtship of Mr. Tosi in the spring, according to people familiar with the matter. It wasn't the first time Mr. Tosi had been approached by a technology company. \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . made a fruitless attempt to hire him in 2010, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Tosi, who in his 30s was \uc2 Merrill Lynch & Co\uc2 .'s CFO, chose \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  becuase it is a nascent company that he can help shape, while the other technology companies that have tried to lure him were more developed, like \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 , according to a person familiar with his decision.\par \par \uc2 Known inside \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  as "L.T.," he has long had a tech bent and an entrepreneurial streak, Blackstone President \uc2 Hamilton "Tony" James\uc2  said in an interview. He introduced back-office technology there and helped develop a pair of financial-data companies in which \uc2 Blackstone\uc2  invested, and it was known within the firm that he hoped to someday run a technology company.\par \par \uc2 "Even though he loved \uc2 Blackstone\uc2 , that was his aspiration," Mr. James said. "We accepted that, we managed around it and we built around it."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20150728000012"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJE000020150728eb7s0000b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But he is not there for his looks. Bouk wants us to focus on his bulging bicep, across which is tattooed "SSN 535-07-5248": his social security number.\par \par \uc2 The photograph of Thomas Cave by documentary photographer Dorothea Lange illustrates the high water mark of American respect for statistical labelling. Cave was so proud of his newly issued number that he had it inked forever on his arm.\par \par \uc2 When the Roosevelt administration introduced the federal social security system in the 1930s, it worked out rates of contribution and benefit on the basis of statistical practices already established by life insurance companies. The industry is at the heart of Bouk's history of personal data collection and analysis - because it worked out how to measure and predict the health of ordinary Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\par \par \uc2 Life insurers took a financial grip on US middle classes from the 1830s. Their agents convinced male professionals and businessmen of the "need to replace themselves, at least in a monetary sense, upon their deaths, to ensure that their wives . . . never had to work and that their children would not become orphaned wards of the state," Bouk writes.\par \par \uc2 To qualify for a policy, the applicant had to submit to an investigation by the agent about his age, habits and finances; to agree to set a value on his life; and to undergo a medical examination. In exchange for economic security, applicants allowed themselves to become "commodified risks". The number of Americans in the insurers' corporate files exceeded 10m by 1900.\par \par \uc2 By the 1930s life insurance was woven so deeply into the nation's economic fabric that, when the Great Depression bit, many families were prepared to maintain their policies at almost any cost. A popular view, quoted by Bouk, was: "We'll give up everything except our life insurance. We can't let that go."\par \par \uc2 The industry was in better shape to ride out such an economic crisis than when many companies failed in the downturn following the Panic of 1873. Much of Bouk's excellent work deals with the mathematical and actuarial engineering that insurers undertook between the two depressions to fortify their finances and expand their customer base.\par \par \uc2 At the heart of the exercise was probabilistic risk assessment: predicting the likely longevity of applicants by combining individual medical histories with population-based statistics. Frederick Hoffman of Prudential Insurance toured 100 cemeteries in the southern states with a portable typewriter, gathering birth and death dates of 100,000 people.\par \par \uc2 The data analysis led to important conclusions that had eluded academic researchers. For instance, in 1908 Brandreth Symonds, medical director of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, warned that contrary to contemporary medical opinion, it was healthier to be thin than fat. Though weight loss was then associated with tuberculosis, overweight people suffered more premature mortality because of their higher rates of heart and kidney disease and diabetes.\par \par \uc2 Bouk, a historian at New York's Colgate University, brings out the racial tensions intrinsic to the mortality data. Black Americans lived shorter lives, on average, as a result of worse living conditions, and insurers penalised them as a group by offering less favourable terms without regard for individual circumstances. After the civil war, black activists challenged the assumption that past data reliably predicted a group's future mortality. Some states passed laws to stop this sort of discrimination, upon which many companies refused to insure African-Americans at all.\par \par \uc2 The detailed narrative stops with the second world war, though Bouk includes an epilogue showing how the statistical foundations of risk management, laid down by life insurers and then by government on paper and cards, led later in the 20th century to a " \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  " explosion as computers and electronic storage took over. Americans were never again as happy to be numbered and analysed as they had been in 1939.\par \par \uc2 The writer is the FT's science editor\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020150727eb7r0001x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 By now, it is a given in New York City that many companies in the tech and advertising sectors prefer older loft buildings in nontraditional office neighborhoods, where they offer millennial workers must-haves such as coffee bars and Ping-Pong tables.\par \par \uc2 But finding all that in a building with robust Internet options can be tricky to pull off.\par \par \uc2 Internet capacity can vary widely from building to building, especially in neighborhoods populated with the funky loft spaces coveted by creative firms, technology consultants and brokers said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou can't tell from a pretty lobby or trust somebody's pitch about the building, no matter how earnest that pitch might be," said Arie Barendrecht, CEO and co-founder of WiredScore, which evaluates and rates office buildings for the speed and reliability of Internet connections as well as the choice of Internet providers offered. \u8220\'20\'1CThere are lots of challenges and variation in connectivity, and not all are obvious."\par \par \uc2 Some buildings may have limited options from which to choose broadband Internet service providers, and downloading and uploading speeds could be slower than expected. Others may have wiring to the network beneath the street at only one point of entry, with no alternative to serve as a backup if it is damaged. Often the preferred fiber wiring is inside the building but not connected to the tenant's floor.\par \par \uc2 Among other concerns is the lack of well-managed, centralized places where new tenants can connect easily to provider networks, said Wes Rudes, executive director at real-estate-services firm \uc2 Cushman & Wakefield Inc\uc2 . Access fees that some landlords charge Internet service providers can also dissuade them from wiring buildings.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe want to provide cost-effective services," said Shrihari Pandit, co-owner of Stealth Communications, an Internet service provider. \u8220\'20\'1CSo it makes it difficult for us to enter buildings who ask us to pay fees."\par \par \uc2 Anticipating hurdles, tenants like PhotoShelter have become savvy when scouting out new office space.\par \par \uc2 The 10-year-old company, which offers a digital-archival and management system for large users of photography, plans to give itself plenty of time to find a new office before the lease at its Union Square location expires at the end of next year, said co-founder Jeffrey Arnold. Several years ago, he said, he waited 18 months for the company's Internet-service provider to install a fiber-optic connection.\par \par \uc2 While the city's modern skyscrapers typically have the high-speed connections PhotoShelter needs, \u8220\'20\'1Ctech businesses like ours generally don't want to be in those buildings," said Mr. Arnold, whose staff generally resides in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side. \u8220\'20\'1COne of the things we use to hire is the quirkiness of the building."\par \par \uc2 To be sure, many of the city's leading landlords have experience housing large companies with \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  needs. They have brought in multiple Internet service providers, carved out space for rooftop wireless connections, and improved their building's cellular networks, real-estate executives said.\par \par \uc2 A number of those owners highlight their WiredScore rankings in their marketing to set them apart from competitors.\par \par \uc2 The landmarked Empire State Building has a platinum WiredScore rating\u8212\'20\'14the highest level, for its Internet capacity. Completed in 1931, the skyscraper has attracted tenants such as media company \uc2 Shutterstock Inc\uc2 . and social-media giant \uc2 LinkedIn Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe use all of these different attributes, so tenants have a choice," said Anthony Malkin, chief executive of Empire State Realty Trust Inc., owner of the Empire State Building. \u8220\'20\'1CIf you only have one service provider, your tenant could be held hostage."\par \par \uc2 In 2013, WiredScore, which has expanded its service to about 50 cities, including London, opened for business with support from the \uc2 New York City Economic Development Corp\uc2 . The company lists the ranked certification levels of New York City commercial buildings on its website for businesses to view.\par \par \uc2 The Economic Development Corp. also maintains an online map of broadband service at commercial buildings in the city, allowing businesses to submit requests for Internet service to as many as a dozen Internet providers. And recently it announced it is working with two Internet service providers to build a broadband network in four industrial business zones, including the southwest Brooklyn and the Greenpoint and Williamsburg industrial sections.\par \par \uc2 Over time, commercial-property owners across the spectrum are becoming more aware of tenants' increasing Internet needs.\par \par \uc2 Brokers now routinely ask about the quality of a building's Internet connections.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat's how you penetrate the consciousness of owners, because they begin to realize it's a factor in the decision-making process," said \uc2 Mary Ann Tighe\uc2 , chief executive of the New York tri-state region for \uc2 CBRE Group Inc\uc2 ., a real-estate-services firm.\par \par \uc2 Caspi Development Co. knew reliable Internet service would be important in luring the tenants it wanted for a revamped, seven-story Lower East Side building it bought and renovated last year. Mounted on a wall in the lobby is a street-level roll gate painted by a graffiti artist, and elsewhere are kitchenettes with beer taps.\par \par \uc2 The company consulted with WiredScore on what it would take to attain a high certification ranking for the property. Caspi then hired Stealth Communications to wire the building with fiber to every floor and install a fiber connection to its Internet network in the street outside. Caspi also plans to add a high-speed wireless connection to its roof.\par \par \uc2 Not long after the renovations were completed last fall, Caspi signed leases with new tenants, including tech company \uc2 Kik Interactive Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe rating system is definitely a vital piece of leasing agents' ability to market a building and gain business," said principal Joshua Caspi. \u8220\'20\'1CI don't think [new tenants] would have come to the building without the fiber."\par \par \uc2 Write to Keiko Morris at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Keiko.Morris@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Keiko.Morris@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020150727eb7r000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Both worsening environmental conditions and hectic work schedules have taken their toll on male fertility in China, experts say.\par \par \uc2 According to a 2012 study by the China Population Association, a state agency, 12.5 per cent of Chinese couples are infertile, or roughly 40m-50m.\par \par \uc2 Enter Alibaba, whose \uc2 Groupon\uc2 -like website Juhuasuan markets everything from underwear to insurance. The ecommerce group's move into boosting sperm donation features a big banner advertisement boasting a phallic cartoon candle exploding into a white cloud, bearing the Chinese character for "semen" in bold lettering.\par \par \uc2 "Avid concentration" the ad reads, with a pun on the character jing , which in Chinese means both "mind" and "sperm".\par \par \uc2 During the donation drive, Alibaba offered men payments of up to $800 for successful sperm donations.\par \par \uc2 Posted between July 15-17, the banner ads produced 22,000 new registrants for the seven participating provincial sperm banks, equivalent to nearly a year's worth of traffic for some of the centres.\par \par \uc2 "This exceeded all expectations," said Wang Zhiqiang, director of the state sperm bank for Guanxi province. "On average, we get about 300 donors a year, but during the three days of the Juhuasuan event, more than 1,000 people signed up. Assuming 20 per cent of them donate, that it 200 new donors."\par \par \uc2 The serious mismatch in supply and demand for sperm has prompted donation centres to overcome many taboos in tradition-bound China. In April, the shortage had become so dire in Hubei province that the regional sperm bank turned to Weibo, China's equivalent of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , to broadcast: "Under-achievers! This is your opportunity! Hubei Sperm Bank is badly in need of sperm," it said.\par \par \uc2 The shortage of sperm donations is partly due to stringent requirements for donors - roughly one in five are acceptable - but mainly because men in China have "shyness about such topics", according to Mr Wang.\par \par \uc2 "We mainly try to get recruits by passing out flyers and holding awareness seminars, but we do not get enough qualified men," he said.\par \par \uc2 But Alibaba has made a speciality out of taking dysfunctional markets and overcoming everything from supply bottlenecks to onerous government regulations and low demand. It has done so in areas such as finance and taxis.\par \par \uc2 Matching sellers with the masses of online traffic is the company's speciality, usually combining with a bit of fun, marketing savvy, \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , and most importantly in the case of sperm donation, anonymity.\par \par \uc2 "People feel shy and embarrassed when we meet them face to face," said Mr Wang.\par \par \uc2 But he said that marketing via the internet added a layer of privacy that makes previously forbidden topics acceptable.\par \par \uc2 "Online, when they don't have to face a human being, they are more comfortable, and this is a major reason why this project is a success," he said, adding: "We don't know whether they will actually come in or not."\par \par \uc2 Additional
