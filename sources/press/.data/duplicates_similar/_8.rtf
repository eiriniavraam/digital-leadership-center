\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc0}{\*\bkmkend toc0}\b \uc2 Machines make bankers better\b0\par\par\uc2 By Martin Arnold \par \uc2 1,352 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 November 2017\par 17:30\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCMA\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Your computer is almost certainly monitoring you right now. So is your phone. Especially if you work at one of the big investment banks, which are increasingly using software to analyse their employees\u8217\'20\'19 communications for signs of wrongdoing and even for missed sales opportunities.\par \par \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  has become the latest investment bank to invest money into ground-breaking \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  software for checking up on its staff by leading a fundraising round in\u160\'00\'A0Behavox, a three-year-old start-up based in the UK.\par \par \uc2 The $20m fundraising at Behavox, which values the company at $200m, is the latest sign that providers of \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  software to monitor the phone calls, emails and electronic chats of bankers are riding a wave of surging growth.\par \par \uc2 Having initially focused on the\u160\'00\'A0compliance applications\u160\'00\'A0of the technology to check for any signs of wrongdoing, the companies are now adapting their software to also analyse customer relationships - helping clients to boost sales as well as avoid big fines.\par \par \uc2 Erkin Adylov, co-founder of Behavox, says \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  plans to use its software to improve its customer relationship management systems. \u8220\'20\'1CThe way you engage people is directly relevant to your performance,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CWe can help firms to work out what drives more revenue.\u8221\'20\'1D Citi declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The company\u8217\'20\'19s technology uses \b \highlight22\uc2 natural language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2  to convert voice to text and then applies sentiment analysis to spot when questions are being asked, someone is shouting or if there is laughter. It can also summarise what the top topics of conversation in the markets each day (see below) and indicate whether overall sentiment is bearish or bullish.\par \par \uc2 By tracking all of this and analysing how it corresponds to orders being generated, the software can help sales and trading staff to get better at their job, says Mr Adylov, a former Goldman Sachs research analyst.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen you hit the phone you have a higher productivity - you almost never lose on trades - and have a hit rate over 90 per cent. But if not, then it\u8217\'20\'19s more like 50 per cent, so you may as well be flipping a coin,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Jan Hammer, a partner at \uc2 Index Ventures\uc2 , which is also investing in Behavox, says: \u8220\'20\'1CTeams at every large organization generate endless streams of data which, when analyzed in real-time, enable businesses to become more effective, secure and compliant.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Critics say many of Behavox\u8217\'20\'19s developers are based in Russia, which has deterred some US groups from using its software. But Mr Adylov, who was raised in Kyrgyzstan before studying in the US and UK, denies its Russian roots have hampered its growth. He says its clients include the UK-listed miner Anglo American, hedge fund Marshall Wace and broker TP Icap.\par \par \uc2 One of its biggest rivals is\u160\'00\'A0Digital Reasoning, which has morphed from helping the US military hunt for terrorists by analysing reams of communications data to helping banks\u160\'00\'A0root out wrongdoing\u160\'00\'A0by checking what their staff are saying.\par \par \uc2 Tim Estes\uc2 , who founded the company at the age of 17 in his hometown of Nashville, says five of the top 10 banks are customers, including \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  and \uc2 UBS\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1COur software is a platform and compliance risk is only one application, but it was the most immediately compelling,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, adding that it too is branching out into other services.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe banks started off having to listen to staff, and they are now realising that listening to customers is necessary to give them an advantage,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Digital Reasoning\u8217\'20\'19s algorithm can search for clients who are asking lots of questions to flag them up as ripe for doing a deal, or spot instances of a trader where clients repeatedly show interest but don\u8217\'20\'19t complete the deal. It can even scan for complaints to help a firm avoid losing customers by prompting it to offer an apology that may help it keep a disatisfied client.\par \par \uc2 Bigger groups are sensing an opportunity and moving into this market, such as \uc2 IBM\uc2  and Nasdaq, which works closely with Digital Reasoning and recently\u160\'00\'A0acquired\u160\'00\'A0Sybenetix, a UK software developer that uses behavioural \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to sniff out rogue traders.\par \par \uc2 FT Fintech video interview\par \par \uc2 The first Tuesday of every month, the FT will interview leading figures from the fintech sector on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  Live video. We started with\u160\'00\'A0Jaidev Janardana, chief executive of Zopa, the UK's oldest peer-to-peer lender. Mr Janardana, who has run the business since 2015, said\u160\'00\'A0Zopa was running a waiting list for investors to put money into its platform, even though it was growing its lending book by 65 per cent annually and had recently tightened its lending criteria "in reaction to what is happening around the world". Specifically, he said Zopa had responded to rising UK inflation by tightening its affordability criteria nine months ago "so we would only consider people with a higher amount of disposable income than we used to do before". He said that meant that "when things go bad, you have less volatility than the market does".\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Further fintech fascination\par \par \uc2 ICO\uc2  alert\u160\'00\'A0The \uc2 EU\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s financial watchdog has issued a warning on the risks of initial coin offerings for investors and given new guidance for companies involved in offering the instruments. Initial coin offerings, which involve a start-up company issuing digital \u8220\'20\'1Ctokens\u8221\'20\'1D or \u8220\'20\'1Ccoins\u8221\'20\'1D in exchange for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, have surged in popularity as consumers rush to speculate on the growth of new technologies. The \uc2 European Securities and Markets Authority\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0warned\u160\'00\'A0that the \u8220\'20\'1Cvery risky and highly speculative\u8221\'20\'1D nature of ICOs meant investors ran a \u8220\'20\'1Chigh risk of losing all of their invested capital\u8221\'20\'1D.\u160\'00\'A0ESMA said\u160\'00\'A0that some ICOs were unregulated, meaning investor protection could not be afforded to those who chose to invest in them. ICOs are also vulnerable to fraud or illicit activities such as money laundering, it added.\par \par \uc2 Russian worry\u160\'00\'A0A senior Whitehall official told the FT that GCHQ, Britain\u8217\'20\'19s digital surveillance agency, has\u160\'00\'A0had concerns for months\u160\'00\'A0about the distribution by \uc2 Barclays\uc2  in the UK of antivirus software from \uc2 Kaspersky Lab\uc2 , one of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most successful computer security companies. \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , which has offered free subscriptions of the software to users of its online banking services since 2008, is seeking to end its arrangement with Kaspersky. The bank said 250,000 downloaded the software.\par \par \uc2 P2P unpicked\u160\'00\'A0Economists at the \uc2 Cleveland Fed\uc2  have published\u160\'00\'A0an excoriating bit of research\u160\'00\'A0that knocks down three of the key claims of \u8220\'20\'1Cpeer-to-peer\u8221\'20\'1D lending advocates: they are\u160\'00\'A0used to refinance previous loans;\u160\'00\'A0they\u160\'00\'A0help\u160\'00\'A0consumers build their credit history; and\u160\'00\'A0they serve people who don\u8217\'20\'19t otherwise have access to credit.

Friends there tell me it has become popular, as bank charges for transfers and ATM withdrawals are much higher Stateside.\u160\'00\'A0Nevertheless, I think it will catch on here,\u160\'00\'A0writes the FT's Claer Barrett.\par \par \uc2 Paperless record\u160\'00\'A0Customers shopping in the UK will soon be able to ditch paper receipts and use their mobile banking app to see details of all their spending, in the latest example of digital innovation.

Mr. Mirpour previously worked at U.S. buyout giant \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said small investments by private-equity firms provide a way to gain familiarity with "what is going on at the grass-roots level while also safeguarding their private-equity investments from any AI-related disruption risks on a large scale. Down the line in five to 10 years, private-equity will be all over those AI companies, which will be front-runners for a buyout."\par \par \uc2 One such deal was in July, when \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Summit Partners\uc2  were part of a $75 million Series D financing led by New York-based \uc2 Insight Venture Partners\uc2  in U.K. cybersecurity firm \uc2 Darktrace\uc2 , which uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  tools like \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology to identify threats to corporate networks. \uc2 KKR\uc2  and Summit invested in previous rounds of capital for \uc2 Darktrace\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Summit's London-based Managing Director \uc2 Han Sikkens\uc2 , who is the lead investor and a board director at \uc2 Darktrace\uc2 , pointed to the company's disruptive technology in a fast-growing cybersecurity sector "which continues to be fueled by high-profile breaches."\par \par \uc2 KKR\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 U.K. AI Capital Flows\par \par \uc2 Another similar deal followed in August when midmarket private-equity firm Livingbridge invested \u163\'00\'A33.5 million in consulting and managed services firm Symphony Ventures, founded in London in 2014.\par \par \uc2 The Series A funding is intended to fuel the growth of Symphony's Robotic Process Automation and Intelligent Automation systems by doubling its employee numbers and expanding its global footprint.\par \par \uc2 Data from \uc2 PitchBook Data Inc\uc2 ., shows private-equity and later-stage growth capital investments in U.K.-based AI companies more than doubled to $676.25 million year-to-date through Oct. 31, from $307.06 million in 2016. Of the total this year, 76% has comprised growth capital and venture capital and 22% private equity.\par \par \uc2 Varun Sunderraman, a London-based partner at merger and acquisition advisory shop Arma Partners, whose clients include private-equity firms in the media, telecommunications and technology sectors, said moving away from the traditional model of investing in a company and then exiting within three to five years will enable firms to take a more considered look at AI.\par \par \uc2 "That means private-equity investors can think longer-term and AI is a longer-term value creator. So, when you change your timing horizon and your prerequisite for having profits at the outset, you've suddenly removed some of the hurdles that prevented you from investing in AI businesses," Mr. Sunderraman said.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, more traditional acquisitions of AI companies are also happening, including by non-U.K. companies.\par \par \uc2 Austin, Texas-based energy \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm DrillingInfo, which is majority-owned by \uc2 Insight Venture Partners\uc2 , announced in October that it is acquiring London-based DataGenic.\par \par \uc2 DataGenic specializes in data-agnostic technologies for energy and industrial clients through a product portfolio that incorporates AI tools, which energy and commodities traders can use to overlay their data for insights into pricing, currencies, shipping instruments and auctions.\par \par \uc2 "We're looking for additional add-on acquisitions that can add next-generation \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  capabilities on top of the data we already have. That's part of our strategy. That's where you can add value," said \uc2 Deven Parekh\uc2 , a New York-based managing director at Insight Venture Partners.\par \par \uc2 Another deal was Palo Alto, Calif.-based Canyon Bridge's purchase of British chip designer Imagination Technologies PLC for \u163\'00\'A3550 million ($742.5 million) in late September after the latter's fallout with its biggest customer, \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . Canyon Bridge is backed by Chinese fund Yitai Capital.\par \par \uc2 Imagination, best known for producing graphics processing units, uses image recognition through \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms, which have allowed high-quality images on Apple's smartphones and tablets.\par \par \uc2 "The U.K. will remain a target for smaller-cap private equity players. We'll see more consolidation. We will ultimately end up with a smaller number of larger businesses," said \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\uc2 's U.K. \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  leader Euan Cameron, who helps private-equity and investee clients navigate the AI landscape through their deal-making efforts.\par \par \uc2 European AI Capital Flows\par \par \uc2 European startups have also been attracting private-equity investments. Data from PitchBook shows private-equity and later-stage growth capital investments in AI companies based in Europe (excluding U.K. and Ireland) reaching $473.02 million year-to-date through Oct. 31, up from $170.70 million in 2016.\par \par \uc2 France and Austria were particularly popular this year, with AI-based acquisitions, where deal values were publicly disclosed, amounting to $20.7 million in the two countries combined. This is a striking contrast to 2016, which saw zero private equity activity in AI across Austria and France, and less than $7 million of venture capital investments in AI across Germany, Sweden, France and Austria, according to data from research firm Dealogic.\par \par \uc2 In October, a consortium of investors comprising CM-CIC Investissement SA, Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH, SEB Alliance SAS and Innovacom Gestion SAS invested about \u8364\'20\'AC6.1 million ($7.2 million) in Robart GmbH, an Austrian developer of AI for consumer and industrial robots.\par \par \uc2 That same month, pan-European private-equity firm Idinvest Partners SA joined hands with a group of venture capitalist investors including Kurma Partners and Partech Ventures for a $6.4 million investment in Paris-based medical technology enterprise Cardiologs Technologies SAS, which uses AI in an electrocardiography analysis platform.\par \par \uc2 Cardiologs was \uc2 Idinvest Partners\uc2 ' second AI investment in France in less than a month. On Sept. 14, Idinvest led a \u8364\'20\'AC6 million financing deal for Influans SAS, a French publisher of open-source data management and integration software that provides a cloud-based AI platform.\par \par \uc2 Philip Erlanger, managing partner, general partner and co-founder of California-based Pontifax AgTech, advised private-equity investors eyeing AI investments to manage their risks more efficiently by keeping track of competitors and factoring in the possibility that the pace of acceleration of AI tools such as robotics and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  technologies in acquisition targets might be much slower than expected.\par \par \uc2 "It really amounts to patience and having insights into the particular AI technology at hand in terms of how it is differentiated," he said.\par \par \uc2 Pontifax AgTech, which makes later-stage growth capital investments in agricultural technology leaders, held the final close of its Global Food and Technology Fund in October, attracting commitments totaling $105 million after exiting its investment in an AI-based robotic crop management platform, \uc2 Blue River Technology\uc2 , through a $305 million sale to John Deere in September.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Erlanger said that the firm now hopes to clinch other new and add-on investments in companies using AI to analyze large data sets across different functions.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, AI is being used to speed up due-diligence processes involved in M&A transactions. KPMG's Strategic Profitability Insights is one such tool, which the firm says reduces the time taken for M&A due diligence-related transactional data analysis from weeks to hours.\par \par \uc2 "These AI tools enable deal makers to open the hood and check how the engine is working to their minutest detail, so that they can decide whether they want to make a bid or not quicker than they could before," said Mike Mills, a KPMG partner whose clients include \uc2 Advent International Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 CVC Capital Partners\uc2  and \uc2 Hellman & Friedman\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171114edbd000gp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 .'s bid to take a stake of as much as $10 billion in \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . is a high-stakes bet on the future of the car industry.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 's billionaire founder, \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , aims to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-boosts-bet-on-ride-hailing-with-play-for-stake-in-uber-1501006584"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 build a global network of ride-hailing companies}}}\uc2  with a lock on important markets that in the next 20 or 30 years could control fleets of vehicles and help dictate how people move around, say people briefed on his strategy.\par \par \uc2 To do that, the Japanese tech-investment giant and a new fund it runs have invested billions of dollars in companies that dominate the business in China, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as Uber's biggest rival in Brazil. Mr. Son took a step forward with his plans to buy as much as 14% of Uber on Sunday, when Uber board members settled a feud over control of seats, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-set-to-announce-softbank-deal-after-kalanick-benchmark-reach-terms-1510516418"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 clearing the way for SoftBank's tender offer}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But not everyone shares Mr. Son's grand vision, even within the companies in which SoftBank has taken a stake.\par \par \uc2 Companies including \uc2 Google\uc2  parent \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . and car makers such as \uc2 Toyota Motor Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Nissan Motor Co\uc2 . have different ideas of how the future will unfold.\par \par \uc2 "The traditional business of building cars and selling cars and owning cars will continue," \uc2 Carlos Ghosn\uc2 , chairman of the alliance between \uc2 Nissan\uc2 , \uc2 Renault SA\uc2  and \uc2 Mitsubishi Motors Corp\uc2 ., said at a conference last week when asked about ride-hailing versus car ownership. "A lot of people think this is substitution. It's not: It's addition."\par \par \uc2 And within the SoftBank stable, rivalries persist. Uber competes with many of the other companies in Mr. Son's stable. Chinese ride-hailing leader \uc2 Didi Chuxing Technology Co\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14in which SoftBank {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-pump-5-billion-into-chinas-didi-1494578599"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 led a $5.5 billion investment round}}}\uc2  this year\u8212\'20\'14has its own visions of global domination.\par \par \uc2 Didi has bought stakes in more ride-hailing companies than SoftBank, and says it wants its technology to be used by them. Other companies that SoftBank has invested in don't necessarily welcome that, says a person familiar with those companies' thinking.\par \par \uc2 "Didi handles over 25 million daily rides, twice as many as what everyone else adds up to," a Didi spokeswoman said. "We are in the position to develop the most advanced algorithms." Didi shares its knowledge with partners around the globe, she said, and declined to comment on SoftBank's strategy.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  will be pressed to sort out differences among its global network, says Gautam Seshadri, co-founder of ZPX, a Singapore-based financial company that helps match buyers and sellers of private stakes in tech companies.\par \par \uc2 "You're going to see more of these situations, and SoftBank's going to be front and center," Mr. Seshadri said.\par \par \uc2 "We are interested in Uber, but the final deal will depend on the tender price and a minimum percentage shareholding for SoftBank," \uc2 Rajeev Misra\uc2 , a director at SoftBank, said in a statement. Mr. Son declined to be interviewed for this article.\par \par \uc2 The ride-hailing companies that SoftBank has in its portfolio so far include {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-india-rival-raises-1-1-billion-from-tencent-softbank-1507709893"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the owner of the popular Ola app}}}\uc2  in India; Singapore-based Grab Inc., which is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-rival-grabs-fundraising-values-it-at-6-billion-1500867380"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 strong in Southeast Asian nations}}}\uc2  such as Indonesia and the Philippines; 99 in Brazil; and Didi in China.\par \par \uc2 One potential area of conflict has already been cleared up: Last year Uber swapped its China business for a minority stake in Didi. Others remain to be sorted out. Uber has tried to challenge Grab's dominance in Southeast Asia.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son has said he is assembling a portfolio of companies that could be big winners decades from now.\par \par \uc2 "I think the way people use transportation and the lifestyle will be different from today 30 years later, 50 years later," he said in July. "Autonomous cars will be definitely coming, and when that stage comes, this ride-share business becomes even more important."\par \par \uc2 That's a far longer time horizon than most venture funds, which typically look for returns over three to four years.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 's main investment funds, the $93 billion Vision Fund and a $4.5 billion auxiliary vehicle, have the backing of big sovereign-wealth funds from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. That allows Mr. Son to wait for the companies in which he invests to take top share in big, winner-take-all industries, say people who have talked strategy with him. The Vision Fund has a 12-year-term, but investors will likely have an option to keep their money in longer.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  has also plowed money into technology companies that support Mr. Son's vision. Last year, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-buy-arm-holdings-for-more-than-32-billion-1468808434"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 it bought British chip designer}}}\uc2  ARM Holdings PLC, which supplies 95% of the architecture in automotive chips, and directed a hiring spree to speed up development. Through the Vision Fund, it has invested in autonomous-vehicle-technology company Nauto and self-driving \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm \uc2 Brain Corp\uc2 . among others.\par \par \uc2 India is a case study of how the Son vision of a global network of car-hailing companies doesn't necessarily mesh with today's realities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son's \uc2 SoftBank Group\uc2  owns a bit less than 30% of Ola owner ANI Technologies Pvt., according to a person privy to Ola's strategy, and has a board seat. That leads some analysts to speculate Mr. Son could push for a combination of operations in India between Ola and Uber. The two companies are vying for top share in India, say analysts.\par \par \uc2 Any loss of independence would be anathema to Ola CEO \uc2 Bhavish Aggarwal\uc2  and executives there who see Uber as an archrival to be crushed, the person close to Ola said.\par \par \uc2 Ola executives carefully watched a prior e-commerce battle in India that involved online retailer Snapdeal, another SoftBank investee, the person said. In that case, Snapdeal successfully resisted SoftBank's effort to push it into a merger with a larger rival.\par \par \uc2 Ola is bolstering its funding to ensure it has the means to stay independent. Last month, Ola said it had raised $1.1 billion from investors led not by SoftBank but by Chinese tech giant \uc2 Tencent Holdings Ltd\uc2 ., to which it granted a board seat. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  also took part in the fundraising. Ola declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Write to Mayumi Negishi at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:mayumi.negishi@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mayumi.negishi@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Phred Dvorak at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:phred.dvorak@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 phred.dvorak@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-set-to-announce-softbank-deal-after-kalanick-benchmark-reach-terms-1510516418"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Uber Board Settles Feud, Clearing Way for SoftBank Deal}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-boosts-bet-on-ride-hailing-with-play-for-stake-in-uber-1501006584"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SoftBank Boosts Bet on Ride Hailing With Play for Stake in Uber}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-nears-closing-on-100-billion-tech-fund-1494408830"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SoftBank Nears Closing on $100 Billion Tech Fund}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171113edbd001us\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Not uncomfortable enough? \uc2 Facebook\uc2  also says a real live human will have to check them out.\par \par \uc2 Without that human review, it would be too easy to exploit \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's antirevenge-porn service to take down legitimate images. \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , it turns out, has a hard time telling the difference between your naked body and a nude by Titian.\par \par \uc2 The internet giants that tout their AI bona fides have tried to make their algorithms as human-free as possible, and that's been a problem. It has become increasingly apparent over the past year that building systems without humans "in the loop"\u8212\'20\'14{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-is-still-in-denial-about-its-biggest-problem-1506855607"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 especially in the case of Facebook}}}\uc2  and the ads it linked to 470 "inauthentic" Russian-backed accounts\u8212\'20\'14can lead to disastrous outcomes, as actual human brains figure out how to exploit them.\par \par \uc2 Whether it's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-software-beats-human-go-champion-1457516770"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 winning at games like Go}}}\uc2  or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-users-were-unwitting-targets-of-russia-backed-scheme-1507918659"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 keeping watch for Russian influence operations}}}\uc2 , the best AI-powered systems require humans to play an active role in their creation, tending and operation. Far from displacing workers, this combination is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-demand-workers-we-are-not-robots-1422406524"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 spawning new nonengineer jobs}}}\uc2  every day, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/automation-can-actually-create-more-jobs-1481480200"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the preponderance of evidence}}}\uc2  suggests the boom will continue for the foreseeable future.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , of course, is now a prime example of this trend. The company recently announced it would add 10,000 content moderators to the 10,000 it already employs\u8212\'20\'14a hiring surge that will {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebooks-stock-falls-as-widespread-praise-of-earnings-fails-to-offset-security-concerns-2017-11-02"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 impact its future profitability}}}\uc2 , said Chief Executive \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Facebook\uc2  is hardly alone. \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  has long employed humans alongside AI to eliminate ads that violate its terms of service, ferret out fake news and take down extremist \uc2 YouTube\uc2  videos. \uc2 Google\uc2  doesn't disclose how many people are looped into its content moderation, search optimization and other algorithms, but a company spokeswoman says the figure is in the thousands\u8212\'20\'14and growing.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has its own teams to moderate content, though the company is largely silent about how it accomplishes this, other than touting its system's ability to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/a-list-of-what-we-really-learned-during-techs-congressional-hearings/544730/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 automatically delete 95% of terrorists' accounts}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Almost every big company using AI to automate processes has a need for humans as a part of that AI, says Panos Ipeirotis, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. America's five largest financial institutions employ teams of nonengineers as part of their AI systems, says Dr. Ipeirotis, who consults with banks.\par \par \uc2 AI's constant hunger for human brains is based on our increasing demand for services. The more we ask for, the less likely a computer algorithm can go it alone\u8212\'20\'14while the combination can be more effective and efficient. For example, bank workers who previously read every email in search of fraud now make better use of their time investigating emails the AI flags as suspicious, says Dr. Ipeirotis.\par \par \uc2 What AI Can (and Can't) Do\par \par \uc2 A \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 -based AI system is a piece of software that learns, almost like a primitive insect. That means that it can't be programmed\u8212\'20\'14it must be taught.\par \par \uc2 To teach them, humans feed these systems examples, and they need truckloads. To build an AI filter to identify extremist content on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , humans at \uc2 Google\uc2  manually reviewed over a million videos to flag qualifying examples, says a Google spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 An algorithm can only be as good as "the quantity and quality of the training data to get [it] going," says Robin Bordoli, CEO of CrowdFlower Inc., which provides human labor to companies that need people to train and maintain AI algorithms, from auto makers to internet giants to financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 Even when an AI has been trained, its judgment is never perfect. Human oversight is still needed, especially with material in which context matters, such as those extremist \uc2 YouTube\uc2  posts. While AI can take down 83% before a single human flags them, says \uc2 Google\uc2 , the remaining 17% needs humans. But this serves as further training: This data can then be fed back into the algorithm to improve it.\par \par \uc2 Relying on AI can lead to false positives, as when the company pulls down legitimate content that its algorithms {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-faces-tall-order-policing-content-1490283318"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 think might be offensive}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There are many cases when AI can barely perform a task at all, as in the case of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's nude pic filter. Transcribing receipts and business cards, tagging videos and moderating adult content are all tasks that "should be easy for \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , but in practice are too unstructured," says Vili Lehdonvirta, a senior research fellow at the \uc2 Oxford Internet Institute\uc2  in the United Kingdom.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Lehdonvirta maintains {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ilabour.oii.ox.ac.uk/online-labour-index/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the Online Labor Index}}}\uc2 , a real-time estimate of the number of people employed for these sorts of tasks. By his calculations, the number of tasks posted to crowdsourced online labor platforms, which includes this kind of work, is up 40% in the past year alone.\par \par \uc2 Systems at risk of being gamed by fraudsters also require constant human attention, says Dr. Ipeirotis. AIs, once trained, are inexhaustible, but this is a curse as much as a blessing: People who outsmart the algorithm can multiply their results a millionfold.\par \par \uc2 Humans, on the other hand, are slower than AI, but can identify patterns based on very little information. Any time a system must deal with bad actors\u8212\'20\'14like when an entity posing as an American on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-russia-activated-twitter-sleeper-cells-for-election-day-blitz"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 actually a Russian agent}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14there is no replacement for live staffers.\par \par \uc2 A Growing Workforce\par \par \uc2 Some of this labor happens through outsourced systems like \uc2 CrowdFlower\uc2  and Mechanical Turk, \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .'s system for outsourcing individual computer microtasks to a global workforce of more than 500,000 people.\par \par \uc2 Across the globe, between 10,000 and 20,000 people a week pick up online piecework, flagging porn in online forums, teaching self-driving systems to identify pedestrians and training facial-recognition algorithms, Dr. Lehdonvirta estimates. When you include companies' own internal teams, there are probably hundreds of thousands of humans, world-wide, whose work is sold as AI, he says.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Lehdonvirta's estimates don't include the world's biggest human-AI workforce: China's censors. Estimates for the Chinese government's operation alone range from 100,000 to one million. In addition, every Chinese internet company that distributes or hosts content must have its own censors, typically one per 100,000 users.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  isn't in China. One China internet executive told The Wall Street Journal that if it were, it would need 20,000 content moderators\u8212\'20\'14for video alone.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171112edbc000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Some Wall Street heavyweights are crying foul over a proposal by \uc2 Nasdaq Inc\uc2 . that they say will expose hidden trading strategies, in the latest clash between traders and exchanges over \b \highlight22\uc2 Big Data\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A dispute has erupted over \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's plan to launch an options-data service called the "Intellicator Analytic Tool." Critics say that if approved by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , the service could enable sophisticated algorithmic traders to exploit investors.\par \par \uc2 "In the interest of fairness and the investing public, this initiative should be denied by the regulator," \uc2 Thomas Peterffy\uc2 , the billionaire chairman and chief executive of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and one of the pioneers of automated options trading, said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Exchanges in recent years have sought to boost profits by selling data, often reaching into the torrent of electronic-trading activity that rushes through their markets for data to package and sell.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  PHLX is the second-biggest U.S. options exchange. Some 12 billion to 14 billion digital messages a day zip through its systems, representing trades and other information, according to \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Intellicator -- a combination of the words intelligent indicator -- would use that activity to gauge market sentiment. Every minute, it would spit out numbers corresponding to a part of the options market and show whether investors in that market segment were bullish or bearish.\par \par \uc2 While it wouldn't reveal the identities of investors, the Intellicator could reveal the "customer type" of buyers or sellers in thinly traded markets. For instance, it could show whether a trade was initiated by a small investor or money manager, by identifying certain traders as "professional customers" who place larger volumes of orders each day.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  said in a September \uc2 SEC\uc2  filing that, in some cases, the Intellicator could be used to "reverse-engineer" the strategies of certain kinds of firms, yielding information "not otherwise available on the Exchange's data feeds."\par \par \uc2 That could harm pension funds and other institutional investors, for whom it is critical to get big trades done quietly, said Peter Maragos, chief executive of Dash Financial Technologies, an equities and options brokerage.\par \par \uc2 When such big investors want to buy or sell large quantities of options, their brokers will often break the order into chunks and execute them throughout the day. The idea is to avoid tipping off the market about the large investor's intentions.\par \par \uc2 But if the Intellicator reveals a small order was initiated by a big investor, others could infer that the investor is about to buy or sell many options, potentially affecting the price of the underlying stock. An algorithmic trader could quickly buy or sell that stock, resulting in a worse price for the investor on the options, Mr. Maragos said. "We don't see how this benefits investors in any way," he said.\par \par \uc2 A major Wall Street lobby group urged the \uc2 SEC\uc2  to block the Intellicator proposal in a letter released Thursday. "If this data is made publicly available, customer trades could be adversely impacted if bad actors attempt to utilize this data to manipulate the market," the group, Sifma, said in the letter, which was dated Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Kimsey, \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's head of global data products, said in an emailed response: "We have developed these products with great care and consideration to ensure that they cannot be used in a manner that is detrimental to the market."\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  says it is actually trying to "democratize" options data, or level the playing field between high-tech traders and ordinary investors. The New York exchange operator consulted with dozens of its customers before unveiling the Intellicator and sought to minimize the risk of exposing anyone's secrets, Mr. Kimsey said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Customer-type data is available elsewhere, and savvy traders already use it, he said, though he added that no other source releases such data as frequently as every 60 seconds, as the Intellicator would.\par \par \uc2 Some market veterans say the Intellicator proposal won't have as much impact as critics fear. "What \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  is trying to do is add a little more transparency," said Henry Schwartz, president of options data firm Trade Alert LLC. "But I don't think they're overdoing it."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 SEC\uc2  has until Nov. 18 to respond to \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's plan, though it could just decide to delay a decision for months.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  unveiled the Intellicator in an August SEC filing, but withdrew that filing less than two weeks later. When it filed an expanded version in September, it included the material about how the Intellicator could help reverse-engineer hidden trading strategies. Mr. Kimsey said \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  added those sections after talking to the SEC. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The clash comes as the arcane business of exchange-data feeds has come under growing scrutiny, even drawing attention from the Treasury Department in a report last month.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Gunjan Banerji contributed to this article.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich446\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal6690

It figured one way to reduce expenses would be to remove a layer of oversight.\par \par \uc2 So, the bank in June shed its holding-company structure, an umbrella corporation regulated by the Fed. With that gone, the Fed was out of the picture.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't really need to be regulated by both," said Chief Executive George Gleason, referring to the FDIC and the Fed. Although the bank hasn't detailed savings, it expects to reduce administrative, accounting and regulatory costs.\par \par \uc2 Cutting costs holds obvious appeal for banks at a time when tepid economic growth, superlow interest rates and stringent regulation have kept profitability in check. But dollars and cents aren't the only driver of decisions like \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 ': Changes in U.S. banking laws in recent decades have limited the advantage of the holding company structure for many firms, and the pro-business shift in Washington has helped embolden some bankers.\par \par \uc2 While some skeptics of the move worry about banks shedding a layer of oversight\u8212\'20\'14potentially enabling them to engage in more risky lending or other activities\u8212\'20\'14bank executives counter that they will still be under the scrutiny of the FDIC.\par \par \uc2 Even some regulators back such moves. "Banks should be able to structure themselves in whatever way they want," \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , acting head of the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , one of the main federal bank regulators, told The Wall Street Journal. "Holding-company form is an anomaly throughout the world."\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 , with roughly $21 billion in assets, is the biggest company in recent years to make such a change. Its move has stirred interest among small banks looking to save money at a time when loan growth has often been hard to come by and superlow interest rates are squeezing profits.\par \par \uc2 BancorpSouth Bank\uc2  in Tupelo, Miss., completed a similar conversion last week. "We're spending time, money and effort with the Fed that we really don't have to," said CEO Dan Rollins. "Keep it simple."\par \par \uc2 Others are considering the strategy, too. Speaking on his bank's earnings call last month, New York Community Bancorp Inc. finance chief Thomas Cangemi said, "Do we have to stay as a bank holding company?" Changing that, he added, could be "an option going forward."\par \par \uc2 "This is taking regulatory relief into their own hands," said V. Gerard Comizio, a partner at law firm \uc2 Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP\uc2 , who said he has heard from dozens of banks interested in the transition.\par \par \uc2 It is also a way for banks to sidestep things such as Fed-administered stress tests, even if they surpass a $50 billion asset threshold that usually triggers such oversight. Stress tests are costly in terms of both time and staffing.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco-based \uc2 First Republic Bank\uc2 , for example, has grown to $84 billion in assets from $33 billion five years ago. Although it crossed the $50 billion line, First Republic doesn't undergo Fed stress testing.\par \par \uc2 First Republic executives declined to comment but have talked favorably about their structure in calls with analysts and investors. "We keep it very, very simple," CEO \uc2 James Herbert\uc2  told an industry conference in late 2015. "We don't even have a holding company."\par \par \uc2 New York-based \uc2 Signature Bank\uc2  is another lender that doesn't have a holding company. Although at $41 billion in assets it hasn't crossed the $50 billion mark, executives note the benefit of a streamlined structure. "We're so heavily regulated to begin with\u8212\'20\'14why would you add on to that?" said Executive Vice President \uc2 Eric Howell\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Granted, not all banks can get rid of their holding companies. Banks that engage in certain riskier activities, such as securities underwriting, must have a holding company to keep those units separate from the one holding bank deposits. For instance, \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 . wouldn't be able to shed their holding companies.\par \par \uc2 The simpler structure also holds some potential drawbacks. For example, banks without a holding-company structure have less flexibility to invest in other companies. That could be a turnoff for those that want to buy stakes in financial-technology firms, said Chip MacDonald, a partner at law firm \uc2 Jones Day\uc2  who is working with banks considering such a move.\par \par \uc2 Smaller community banks also can hold higher levels of debt if they operate under holding companies, which can help with mergers.\par \par \uc2 A holding company is essentially a parent organization for a bank and its related entities, and about 80% of U.S. banks and thrifts operate under this structure. But in recent years, the benefits from such an arrangement have shrunk while regulatory costs have risen.\par \par \uc2 Many banks adopted the holding-company structure in the 1980s so they could do business across state lines. Banks today no longer need a holding company to do so.\par \par \uc2 Other banks created holding companies to get more flexibility to count various forms of capital toward their regulatory benchmarks. Post-financial-crisis regulatory changes curbed that benefit.\par \par \uc2 To make the change, \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  merged its parent company into its bank. It had to hold a shareholder vote and file merger applications with the FDIC and state banking regulators, but it didn't need the Fed's permission.\par \par \uc2 Eliminating the holding-company structure holds other benefits. A holding company generally requires a separate set of financial results, its own board meetings and oversight of transactions between the holding company and the bank.\par \par \uc2 Plus, banks, unlike bank holding companies, don't file quarterly and annual reports with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . Instead they file with bank regulators. The FDIC also doesn't charge a registration fee when banks issue new shares, as the SEC does, \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Having one less regulator could also speed up some processes, such as getting mergers approved. That was an important consideration to \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 , which has gobbled up rivals and quintupled its assets in the past five years.\par \par \uc2 Such moves have caused some concern that banks could shop for more lenient regulators, engaging in regulatory arbitrage. That became an issue before the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  and other firms counter by saying the FDIC isn't a lenient regulator. The FDIC and Federal Reserve don't have an official position on holding-company changes.\par \par \uc2 "It might be arbitrage," Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of policy-analysis firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 ., said of banks changing their structure. "But it's also a huge boost to their challenged earnings."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gleason described shedding \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 ' holding company the way he shed an unused lake house:\par \par \uc2 "I got rid of it, too," he said. "We hadn't used it for anything for years."\par \par \uc2 Write to Christina Rexrode at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:christina.rexrode@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 christina.rexrode@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-see-few-monetary-policy-changes-with-powell-leading-fed-1510239600"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Economists See Few Monetary Policy Changes With Powell Leading Fed}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/arkansas-bank-fills-a-lending-void-1468947270"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Arkansas Bank Fills a Lending Void}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-republic-is-it-wrong-to-build-a-bank-for-wealthy-clients-only-1471388308"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 First Republic: Is It Wrong to Build a Bank for Wealthy Clients Only?}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-vows-to-ease-regulations-for-community-banks-1493665954"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Trump Vows to Ease Regulations for Community Banks}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-only-bank-this-hip-hop-mogul-will-use-1440978447"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Only Bank This Hip-Hop Mogul Will Use}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROFR20171109edb90002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

"Most big peers have more like half that number."\par \par \uc2 Deutsche has made about 4,000 of the 9,000 job cuts promised under a fiveyear restructuring plan announced in late 2015. Mr Cryan said many of the additional cuts would come through using technology to boost efficiency in the bank's processes. "We're too manual, which can make you error-prone and it makes you inefficient. There's a lot of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and mechanisation that we can do," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan also described the ratio of front office, revenue-generating staff, to back office people who keep the bank's systems running as "out of kilter".\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Jes Staley\uc2 , Barclays' chief executive, tackled the high costs he inherited with a hiring freeze, Mr Cryan described Deutsche as having a "hiring frost".\par \par \uc2 Once the world's biggest investment bank, Deutsche's star has been on the wane for years as post-crisis regulation made the bank's mighty fixed income business less profitable and big misconduct fines and high legacy costs hit the bottom line.\par \par \uc2 Despite a vow to cut \u8364\'20\'AC3bn from its cost base under Strategy 2020, the German lender made a return on tangible equity of 4 per cent for the third quarter of this year, far short of its medium-term 10 per cent target.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan, who has raised \u8364\'20\'AC8bn of capital since he took over Deutsche in mid-2015 and has settled many of the bank's most painful litigation issues, has come under fire from investors over Deutsche's poor operating performance. The bank's share price has almost halved under his tenure.\par \par \uc2 Critics have questioned his blunt messaging, which they say has demotivated staff, contributing to key departures and a decline in revenue.\par \par \uc2 The plain-speaking Briton told the FT there was "an easy" opportunity to save money by collaborating with rivals in the area of crime prevention and detection.\par \par \uc2 "Every bank at the moment has a huge and burgeoning department of people who are doing the same stuff," he said. "It's not a source of competitive advantage and you're exposed to making your own mistakes."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171211edb9003j9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

"Most big peers have more like half that number."\par \par \uc2 Deutsche has made about 4,000 of the 9,000 job cuts promised under a fiveyear restructuring plan announced in late 2015. Mr Cryan said many of the additional cuts would come through using technology to boost efficiency in the bank's processes. "We're too manual, which can make you error-prone and it makes you inefficient. There's a lot of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and mechanisation that we can do," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan also described the ratio of front office, revenue-generating staff, to back office people who keep the bank's systems running as "out of kilter".\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Jes Staley\uc2 , Barclays' chief executive, tackled the high costs he inherited with a hiring freeze, Mr Cryan described Deutsche as having a "hiring frost".\par \par \uc2 Once the world's biggest investment bank, Deutsche's star has been on the wane for years as post-crisis regulation made the bank's mighty fixed income business less profitable and big misconduct fines and high legacy costs hit the bottom line.\par \par \uc2 Despite a vow to cut \u8364\'20\'AC3bn from its cost base under Strategy 2020, the German lender made a return on tangible equity of 4 per cent for the third quarter of this year, far short of its medium-term 10 per cent target.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan, who has raised \u8364\'20\'AC8bn of capital since he took over Deutsche in mid-2015 and has settled many of the bank's most painful litigation issues, has come under fire from investors over Deutsche's poor operating performance. The bank's share price has almost halved under his tenure.\par \par \uc2 Critics have questioned his blunt messaging, which they say has demotivated staff, contributing to key departures and a decline in revenue.\par \par \uc2 The plain-speaking Briton told the FT there was "an easy" opportunity to save money by collaborating with rivals in the area of crime prevention and detection.\par \par \uc2 "Every bank at the moment has a huge and burgeoning department of people who are doing the same stuff," he said. "It's not a source of competitive advantage and you're exposed to making your own mistakes."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171211edb90016d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 The chief executive of Deutsche Bank has given his clearest hint that his bank could cut tens of thousands more jobs as it turns to technology to bring costs into line with sharply lower revenues.\par \par \uc2 "We employ 97,000 people," \uc2 John Cryan\uc2  told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 . "Most big peers have more like half that number."\par \par \uc2 Deutsche has made about 4,000 of the 9,000 job cuts promised under a fiveyear restructuring plan announced in late 2015. Mr Cryan said many of the additional cuts would come through using technology to boost efficiency in the bank's processes. "We're too manual, which can make you error-prone and it makes you inefficient. There's a lot of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and mechanisation that we can do," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan also described the ratio of front office, revenue-generating staff, to back office people who keep the bank's systems running as "out of kilter".\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Jes Staley\uc2 , Barclays' chief executive, tackled the high costs he inherited with a hiring freeze, Mr Cryan described Deutsche as having a "hiring frost".\par \par \uc2 Once the world's biggest investment bank, Deutsche's star has been on the wane for years as post-crisis regulation made the bank's mighty fixed income business less profitable and big misconduct fines and high legacy costs hit the bottom line.\par \par \uc2 Despite a vow to cut \u8364\'20\'AC3bn from its cost base under Strategy 2020, the German lender made a return on tangible equity of 4 per cent for the third quarter of this year, far short of its medium-term 10 per cent target.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan, who has raised \u8364\'20\'AC8bn of capital since he took over Deutsche in mid-2015 and has settled many of the bank's most painful litigation issues, has come under fire from investors over Deutsche's poor operating performance. The bank's share price has almost halved under his tenure.\par \par \uc2 Critics have questioned his blunt messaging, which they say has demotivated staff, contributing to key departures and a decline in revenue.\par \par \uc2 The plain-speaking Briton told the FT there was "an easy" opportunity to save money by collaborating with rivals in the area of crime prevention and detection.\par \par \uc2 "Every bank at the moment has a huge and burgeoning department of people who are doing the same stuff," he said. "It's not a source of competitive advantage and you're exposed to making your own mistakes."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171211edb9000v8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 The chief executive of Deutsche Bank has given his clearest hint that his bank could cut tens of thousands more jobs as it turns to technology to bring costs into line with sharply lower revenues.\par \par \uc2 "We employ 97,000 people," \uc2 John Cryan\uc2  told the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2 . "Most big peers have more like half that number."\par \par \uc2 Deutsche has made about 4,000 of the 9,000 job cuts promised under a fiveyear restructuring plan announced in late 2015. Mr Cryan said many of the additional cuts would come through using technology to boost efficiency in the bank's processes. "We're too manual, which can make you error-prone and it makes you inefficient. There's a lot of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and mechanisation that we can do," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan also described the ratio of front office, revenue-generating staff, to back office people who keep the bank's systems running as "out of kilter".\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Jes Staley\uc2 , Barclays' chief executive, tackled the high costs he inherited with a hiring freeze, Mr Cryan described Deutsche as having a "hiring frost".\par \par \uc2 Once the world's biggest investment bank, Deutsche's star has been on the wane for years as post-crisis regulation made the bank's mighty fixed income business less profitable and big misconduct fines and high legacy costs hit the bottom line.\par \par \uc2 Despite a vow to cut \u8364\'20\'AC3bn from its cost base under Strategy 2020, the German lender made a return on tangible equity of 4 per cent for the third quarter of this year, far short of its medium-term 10 per cent target.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan, who has raised \u8364\'20\'AC8bn of capital since he took over Deutsche in mid-2015 and has settled many of the bank's most painful litigation issues, has come under fire from investors over Deutsche's poor operating performance. The bank's share price has almost halved under his tenure.\par \par \uc2 Critics have questioned his blunt messaging, which they say has demotivated staff, contributing to key departures and a decline in revenue.\par \par \uc2 The plain-speaking Briton told the FT there was "an easy" opportunity to save money by collaborating with rivals in the area of crime prevention and detection.\par \par \uc2 "Every bank at the moment has a huge and burgeoning department of people who are doing the same stuff," he said. "It's not a source of competitive advantage and you're exposed to making your own mistakes."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171109edb90006g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Chip makers are racing to develop \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  products to fuel growth as sales of smartphones and personal computers cool.\par \par \uc2 Nvidia Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Intel Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Advanced Micro Devices Inc\uc2 . and a raft of startups are crafting new processors to tap into a broader market for AI hardware and software that is growing 50% a year, according to \uc2 International Data Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Growth has been elusive in some areas of the semiconductor industry, contributing to a wave of consolidation capped this week when networking specialist Broadcom Ltd. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/broadcom-proposes-to-acquire-qualcomm-for-70-per-share-1509971816"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bid $105 billion}}}\uc2  for smartphone-chip leader \uc2 Qualcomm Inc\uc2 . in what would be the sector's biggest deal to date.\par \par \uc2 Global spending on AI-related hardware and software could expand to $57.6 billion in 2021 from $12 billion this year, IDC estimates. Of that, a sizable portion will go into data centers, which by 2020 are expected to devote a quarter of capacity to AI-related computations, IDC projects.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, certain AI techniques have become central to the ability of, say, \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 .'s Echo smart-speaker to understand spoken commands. They enable the Nest security camera from \uc2 Google\uc2  parent \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 . to distinguish familiar people from strangers so it can send an alert. They also allow \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . to match social-media posts with ads most likely to interest the person doing the posting.\par \par \uc2 The biggest internet companies\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  as well as Amazon, \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Microsoft Corp\uc2 . and their Chinese counterparts\u8212\'20\'14are packing their data centers with specialized hardware to accelerate the training of AI software to, for instance, translate documents.\par \par \uc2 The online giants all are exploiting an AI approach known as \b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  that allows software to find patterns in digital files such as imagery, recordings and documents. It can take time for such programs to discover meaningful patterns in training data. Internet giants want to improve their algorithms without waiting weeks to find out whether the training panned out.\par \par \uc2 The chip makers are vying to help them do it faster.\par \par \uc2 Much of \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's 24-year history was spent making high-end graphics chips for personal computers. Lately, its wares have proven faster than conventional processors in training AI software.\par \par \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 , which reported third-quarter earnings Thursday that exceeded Wall Street's forecasts for revenue and profit, has nearly tripled its sales to data centers in the past 12 months to roughly $1.6 billion, largely driving a nearly sevenfold increase in the stock price to $205.32 as of Thursday's close.\par \par \uc2 The recent optimism around \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  "is what everyone in the space has been experiencing," said Mike Henry, chief executive of AI-chip startup Mythic Inc. Mr. Henry said an "explosion of interest" has yielded $15 million in investments in Mythic from venture outfits including Silicon Valley firm DFJ.\par \par \uc2 Private investors have nearly doubled their total stake in AI hardware to $252 million this year, according to \uc2 PitchBook Data Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's chief rivals aren't standing still. Last year, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-apple-add-to-artificial-intelligence-deal-wave-1470772801"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Intel bought Nervana Systems}}}\uc2  for an undisclosed sum. The chip giant is working with \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and others to deliver Nervana-based chips, intended to outdo \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  for AI calculations, by the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 Beyond Nervana, \uc2 Intel\uc2  is prioritizing AI performance throughout its data-center product line. Revenue in the divisions responsible for server processors and programmable chips were up 7% and 10%, respectively, from the prior year, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-lifts-guidance-as-profit-surges-34-1509050935"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Intel said in its third-quarter earnings}}}\uc2  report last month.\par \par \uc2 "We don't disclose our total investments in these things, but it's a large effort" on par with its work to lead the way in conventional processing, said \uc2 Naveen Rao\uc2 , who leads \uc2 Intel\uc2 's AI group.\par \par \uc2 Advanced Micro Devices\uc2 , which competes with \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  for graphics in game systems, recently shipped its own AI-focused graphics processor line called Radeon Instinct. \uc2 Baidu Inc\uc2 . is a customer, and AMD said in its most-recent earnings call that other cloud providers are as well.\par \par \uc2 Some companies aren't waiting for the big chip vendors. \uc2 Google\uc2  has designed its own AI accelerators, seeking an advantage by tailoring silicon specifically for its software.\par \par \uc2 "This field is only getting started," said \uc2 Ian Buck\uc2 , \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's head of accelerated computing, "and it's being invented and reinvented, it feels like, every quarter."\par \par \uc2 Write to Ted Greenwald at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171109edb9002jp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Seeks Financial Information on Individuals Detained in Saudi Arabia; Central bank asks financial firms to provide transaction details for 19 people including Prince al-Waleed\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nicolas Parasie \par \uc2 723 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 November 2017\par 11:36\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DUBAI\u8212\'20\'14The United Arab Emirates' central bank has asked financial firms operating in the country to provide information on several individuals detained in Saudi Arabia as part of a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/broad-crackdown-reins-in-saudi-arabias-elite-1509932882"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 government-led corruption investigation}}}\uc2  there, including {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/detained-saudi-prince-has-invested-widely-in-the-west-1509915000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 billionaire tycoon Prince al-Waleed bin Talal}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The U.A.E. central bank's request, a copy of which has been seen by The Wall Street Journal, is the first sign that the fallout from the Saudi crackdown is spreading beyond the kingdom's borders.\par \par \uc2 In a circular dated Nov. 7 and addressed to the main branches of national and foreign banks, as well as money exchanges and investment companies active in the U.A.E., the central bank asked the firms to share financial information on transfers and withdrawals from accounts held by 19 individuals.\par \par \uc2 Among those listed are Prince al-Waleed, who has backed some of the world's best known companies including \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 ., and Bakr bin Laden, chairman of construction firm the \uc2 Saudi Binladin Group\uc2 . The two men didn't immediately respond to requests for comment via their companies.\par \par \uc2 The central bank gave the firms until Nov. 8 to submit detailed reports to its financial-intelligence department but didn't say why it wanted the information. Several banks contacted by the Journal didn't immediately comment on whether they had provided the requested information.\par \par \uc2 Dubai, which is located in the U.A.E., is the Persian Gulf's pre-eminent financial hub where most of the world's top banks have their regional headquarters and where many Saudis carry out financial transactions. As such it is the obvious first stop for Saudi authorities looking to recover assets outside the kingdom.\par \par \uc2 However, it wasn't immediately clear whether the central bank's circular, which didn't mention freezing accounts, was issued at the request of the Saudi authorities. Central bank officials in both countries couldn't be immediately reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 The U.A.E. central bank's move suggests that the country's leadership backs the Saudi crown prince's reforms, including his anticorruption efforts, said Cinzia Bianco, a senior analyst at Gulf State \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a Washington, D.C.-based geopolitical-risk consultancy. "It is just further evidence to how tight the MbS-MbZ axis has become," she said, referring to Saudi Arabia's crown prince \uc2 Mohammed bin Salman\uc2  and U.A.E. heir to the throne, Mohammed bin Zayed.\par \par \uc2 However, any attempt by the Saudi authorities to pursue private fortunes beyond the kingdom's borders would represent an unusual move for the region, Mrs. Bianco said. "It is a widespread habit to invest or keep their fortunes in places like Dubai, considered a neoliberal entrep\u244\'00\'F4t, political risk free," she said.\par \par \uc2 Dozens of prominent Saudi businessmen, royal family members and government officials have been detained since the Saudi government launched what it says is an anticorruption campaign at the weekend. The drive is being overseen by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-saudi-prince-unseated-his-cousin-to-become-the-kingdoms-heir-apparent-1500473999"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the country's powerful crown prince}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The crackdown has expanded in recent days, with Saudi authorities making new arrests and freezing close to 1800 bank accounts. The detainees face accusations ranging from money laundering to bribery. Officials have also signaled that they will try to seize assets of those accused of corruption, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-expands-crackdown-on-elite-1510062385"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 potentially confiscating billions of dollars.}}}\par \par \uc2 Saudi Arabia's central bank\uc2  has sought to reassure investors that the crackdown is targeted at individuals rather than companies.\par \par \uc2 Still, most stock markets in the Persian Gulf region have fallen sharply this week amid concerns about the fallout from the crackdown. One concern among some investors is that wealthy Saudi locals could move their money out of the region to safeguard their investments, according to an Abu Dhabi-based fund manager active in the region's markets.\par \par \uc2 Dubai's main stock market fell nearly 6% this week, while Kuwait's market dropped 7%. Saudi Arabia's stock market is only slightly down but that's because of local institutional buying, the fund manager said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Nicolas Parasie at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:nicolas.parasie@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 nicolas.parasie@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-quandary-how-closely-to-align-with-saudis-1510271809"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Saudi Tensions Complicate U.S. Policy}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-growing-saudi-business-mckinsey-hired-officials-children-1510254527/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 McKinsey Hired Saudi Officials' Children}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-orders-citizens-out-of-lebanon-1510242248"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Saudi Arabia Tells Citizens to Leave Lebanon}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-authorities-detain-201-people-in-corruption-crackdown-1510243700?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Riyadh Detains 201 in Crackdown}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171109edb9002bd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

But there's one sector looking upon higher borrowing costs with a deathly shiver: so-called zombie firms.\par \par \uc2 Higher rates pose a grave threat to such firms, which survive on cheap credit rather than strong profits. They are an issue the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2  highlighted in its most recent quarterly review.\par \par \uc2 Zombies account for around 10% of all companies in the U.K. and the eurozone, and over 16% in the U.S., according to researchers from the BIS\u8212\'20\'14a consortium of central banks based in Basel, Switzerland.\par \par \uc2 They define zombie companies as firms over ten years old with a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes relative to interest expenses that's lower than one. In other words, a company whose ability to meet interest expenses is doubtful.\par \par \uc2 This vulnerability, combined with a decline in companies' investment ratings, "suggests that, in the event of a slowdown or an upward adjustment in interest rates, high debt service payments and default risk could pose challenges to corporates, and thereby create headwinds for [gross domestic product] growth," the BIS said.\par \par \uc2 Another downside to zombie firms is their drag on productivity growth.\par \par \uc2 The survival of low-productivity firms, thanks to easy credit, "congests markets and constrains the growth of more productive firms," according to a recent paper by the \uc2 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A 3.5% rise in the share of zombie firms\u8211\'20\'13 roughly what happened between 2005 and 2013 on average across the nine \uc2 OECD\uc2  countries in the study \u8211\'20\'13 is associated with a 1.2% decline in the level of labor productivity across industries, according to the paper.\par \par \uc2 As banks sink more money into zombie firms, they risk a horror scenario. The current low level of nominal interest rates may be temporarily supporting the walking dead. But the zombies could take a bite out of the economy once interest rates rise higher.\par \par \uc2 According to economist Daniel Lacalle, zombie firms and the conditions that keep them afloat constitute a transfer of wealth from savers and healthy companies to inefficient and obsolete businesses.\par \par \uc2 "Zombification does not boost job creation or buy time, it is a perverse incentive that delays the recovery," he said in a recent blog for the Mises Institute.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments Around the World\par \par \uc2 Mnuchin: Yellen Hasn't Decided Whether to Stay at Fed\par \par \uc2 By Kate Davidson\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen hasn't decided whether to stay on the Fed board when her term as chairwoman ends next year, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump last week said he is nominating Fed governor Jerome Powell to succeed Ms. Yellen at the end of her four-year term as Fed chief, which ends Feb. 3. Ms. Yellen is also serving a 14-year term on the Fed's board of governors that doesn't expire until January 2024.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether Ms. Yellen intends to continue serving on the board of governors, Mr. Mnuchin told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, "I don't think she's made any decision in regards to that one way or another yet," adding that the two had breakfast together Wednesday morning.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin also said the administration is moving ahead with plans to fill several other Fed vacancies, including vice chairman.\par \par \uc2 A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen has previously declined to weigh in on whether she would stay at the Fed beyond her tenure as chairwoman, though she acknowledged at a press conference in December that she had the option to stay. "That's a decision for another day," she said at the time.\par \par \uc2 More recently, Ms. Yellen said at a press conference in September, "I have said that I intend to serve out my term as chair, and that I'm really not going to comment on my intentions beyond that."\par \par \uc2 It is customary for Fed leaders to leave the central bank after their terms as chairmen expire. But there is precedent for staying: Marriner Eccles stayed at the Fed as a governor for three years after his term as chairman expired in 1948, when President Harry Truman selected Thomas McCabe to lead the central bank.\par \par \uc2 The Fed's vice chairman slot was vacated last month when Stanley Fischer stepped down.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether the vice chairman would have a strong background in macroeconomics\u8212\'20\'14to complement Mr. Powell, who doesn't have a doctorate in economics as recent Fed leaders have\u8212\'20\'14Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\par \par \uc2 "I wouldn't describe there's a specific criteria," he said. "There's a lot of things that we look at, but the vice chair is a very important position. That's something we're already considering people for."\par \par \uc2 In addition to the vice chairman job, the White House has two other Fed board vacancies to fill and could have a fourth opening if Ms. Yellen chooses to resign in February.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell began meeting with senators on Capitol Hill this week in advance of his confirmation hearing, which is expected to take place before the end of the year but hasn't been scheduled yet.\par \par \uc2 He met Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who voted in favor of Mr. Powell's nomination to the Fed board in 2012 but voted against his renomination in 2014. After the meeting, Mr. McConnell said he looked forward to supporting Mr. Powell's nomination as Fed chairman.\par \par \uc2 "I enjoyed our meeting and learning more about Jay's vision for the Federal Reserve and our nation's monetary policy as our economic recovery continues," Mr. McConnell said in a statement Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Regulator Signals Shift on Leveraged Lending Enforcement\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK\u8212\'20\'14A senior U.S. regulator criticized an Obama-era crackdown on big banks' lending to heavily indebted companies, a shift in tone after a yearslong battle over lending standards.\par \par \uc2 The comments by \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , acting comptroller of the currency, were the first by a senior U.S. official since federal standards for so-called leveraged lending were thrown into legal limbo by a government auditor's ruling in October.\par \par \uc2 Regulators' standards on leveraged lending "shouldn't be binding on anyone," Mr. Noreika said in a Wednesday interview, referring to a 2013 guidance document.\par \par \uc2 "I think leveraged lending goes to the heart of safety and soundness and will always be something that examiners are interested in," Mr. Noreika said. "The criticism which is valid is whether a bank should be cited in an MRA or enforcement action because they haven't complied with the guidance."\par \par \uc2 An MRA, or matter requiring attention, is a private letter from a regulator to a banker, demanding that the banker address a perceived problem.\par \par \uc2 The comptroller's office and the Federal Reserve, two powerful U.S. banking overseers, sent such letters to big banks in recent years demanding that banks bring their standards on making leveraged loans in line with the 2013 guidance document.\par \par \uc2 The standards in that document weren't technically binding on banks, but regulators enforced them strictly. As a result, big banks have passed on financing deals that regulators viewed as out of bounds, such as some private-equity buyouts of companies with high levels of debt. The industry has been hoping for a shift under President Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noreika's comments aren't the final word on the issue since he is serving in an acting capacity. He could soon be replaced by Joseph Otting, a banker nominated to be comptroller. The Senate hasn't yet confirmed Mr. Otting and his views on leveraged lending aren't clear. The Treasury Department under Mr. Trump has said the 2013 document wasn't clear enough and regulators should reissue it.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  said regulators had erred in treating the 2013 document as voluntary guidance, rather than a formal rule. Some legal analysts have said the GAO finding means the document no longer carries any weight, but regulators have been silent on the issue.\par \par \uc2 "It has never been in effect. It is guidance. So it shouldn't be binding on anyone," Mr. Noreika said after a appearing at a conference of the Clearing House Association bank trade group.\par \par \uc2 "This was a useful exercise in reminding the regulators that guidance is guidance, and that is how it is going to have to be treated," he said. "It shouldn't be a reason to be written up. If the examiner has a problem with safety and soundness of leveraged lending, they should have a discussion with [the bank], and the guidance may be one factor they look at in deciding how they are going to address those issues."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noreika also said regulators are discussing the GAO finding and could make a joint statement about the matter in coming weeks. The guidance was issued by the OCC, the Fed and the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Representatives of the Fed and FDIC had no comment.\par \par \uc2 How Some Small Banks Are Firing the Fed\par \par \uc2 By Christina Rexrode\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  wanted to cut costs, so it ditched the Fed.\par \par \uc2 The Little Rock, Ark., bank was regulated by the Federal Reserve, the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 ., a state banking agency and others. It figured one way to reduce expenses would be to remove a layer of oversight.\par \par \uc2 So, the bank in June shed its holding-company structure, an umbrella corporation regulated by the Fed. With that gone, the Fed was out of the picture.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't really need to be regulated by both," said CEO George Gleason, referring to the FDIC and the Fed. Although the bank hasn't detailed savings, it expects to reduce administrative, accounting and regulatory costs.\par \par \uc2 Even some regulators back such moves. "Banks should be able to structure themselves in whatever way they want," \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , acting head of the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , one of the main federal bank regulators, told The Wall Street Journal. "Holding company form is an anomaly throughout the world."\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 , with roughly $21 billion in assets, is the biggest firm in recent years to make such a change. Its move has stirred interest among small banks looking to save money at a time when loan growth has often been hard to come by and superlow interest rates are squeezing profits.\par \par \uc2 BancorpSouth Bank\uc2  in Tupelo, Miss., completed a similar conversion last week. "We're spending time, money and effort with the Fed that we really don't have to," said CEO Dan Rollins. "Keep it simple."\par \par \uc2 Others are considering the strategy, too. Speaking on his bank's earnings call last month, New York Community Bancorp Inc. finance chief Thomas Cangemi said, "Do we have to stay as a bank holding company?" Changing that, he added, could be "an option going forward."\par \par \uc2 "This is taking regulatory relief into their own hands," said V. Gerard Comizio, a partner at law firm \uc2 Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP\uc2 , who said he has heard from dozens of banks interested in the transition.\par \par \uc2 It is also a way for banks to sidestep things like Fed-administered stress tests, even if they surpass a $50 billion asset threshold that usually triggers such oversight.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco-based \uc2 First Republic Bank\uc2 , for example, has grown to $84 billion in assets from $33 billion five years ago. Although it crossed the $50 billion line, First Republic doesn't undergo Fed stress testing.\par \par \uc2 First Republic executives declined to comment but have bragged about their structure in calls with analysts and investors. "We keep it very, very simple," CEO \uc2 James Herbert\uc2  told an industry conference in late 2015. "We don't even have a holding company."\par \par \uc2 New York-based \uc2 Signature Bank\uc2  is another firm that doesn't have a holding company. Although at $41 billion in assets it hasn't crossed the $50 billion mark, executives note the benefit of a streamlined structure. "We're so heavily regulated to begin with -- why would you add on to that?" said Executive Vice President \uc2 Eric Howell\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Granted, not all banks can get rid of their holding companies. Banks that engage in certain riskier activities, such as securities underwriting, must have a holding company to keep those units separate from the one holding bank deposits.\par \par \uc2 The simpler structure also holds some potential drawbacks. For example, banks without a holding-company structure have less flexibility to invest in other companies. That could be a turnoff for firms that want to buy stakes in financial-technology firms, said Chip MacDonald, a partner at law firm \uc2 Jones Day\uc2  who is working with banks considering such a move.\par \par \uc2 Smaller community banks also can hold higher levels of debt if they operate under holding companies, which can help with mergers.\par \par \uc2 A holding company is essentially a parent organization for a bank and its related entities, and about 80% of U.S. banks and thrifts operate under this structure. But in recent years, the benefits from such an arrangement have shrunk while regulatory costs have risen.\par \par \uc2 Many banks adopted the holding-company structure in the 1980s so they could do business across state lines. Banks today no longer need a holding company to do so.\par \par \uc2 Other banks created holding companies to get more flexibility to count various forms of capital toward their regulatory benchmarks. Post-financial-crisis regulatory changes curbed that benefit.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gleason described shedding \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 ' holding company the way he shed an unused lake house: "I got rid of it too," he said. "We hadn't used it for anything for years."\par \par \uc2 To make the change, \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  merged its parent company into its bank. It had to hold a shareholder vote and file merger applications with the FDIC and state banking regulators, but it didn't need the Fed's permission.\par \par \uc2 Eliminating the holding company structure holds other benefits. A holding company generally requires a separate set of financial results, its own board meetings and oversight of transactions between the holding company and the bank.\par \par \uc2 Plus, banks, unlike bank holding companies, don't file quarterly and annual reports with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . Instead they file with bank regulators. The FDIC also doesn't charge a registration fee when banks issue new shares, as the SEC does, \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Having one less regulator could also speed up some processes, such as getting mergers approved. That was an important consideration to \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 , which has gobbled up rivals and quintupled its assets in the past five years.\par \par \uc2 Such moves have caused some concern banks could shop for more lenient regulators, engaging in regulatory arbitrage. That became an issue before the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  and other firms counter by saying the FDIC isn't a lenient regulator.

Banks and legislators have pushed back saying the ECB is hastily overstepping its authority with guidance that is unclear, while at the same demanding too early a start date.\par \par \uc2 Daniele Nouy\uc2  said the wording of the text could be "improved" and opened the door to the law taking effect at a later date saying she could "propose that we give us a little bit more time to take seriously into account the comments that we are receiving."\par \par \uc2 The new rules are due to come into effect at the start of next year, but the ECB's public comment period on the policies runs until Dec. 8.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nouy also said some banks aren't doing enough to deal with the consequences of Britain's decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . She said there was concern about banks setting up "empty shell" firms within the jurisdiction of the ECB, but still heavily relying on services based in the United Kingdom.\par \par \uc2 "Based on Nouy's statements, some of the banks looking to relocate may need to re-examine their Brexit plans," said Michael Huertas, a banking lawyer with Baker McKenzie in Frankfurt.\par \par \uc2 Financial firms rely on "passports" to allow them to operate within the EU from any other EU state. Britain's exit puts that system in jeopardy for firms working out of the U.K., thus potentially forcing them to relocate to the other 27 countries within the EU. The ECB serves as the direct supervisor for large banks within the 19 country eurozone.\par \par \uc2 She said several banks had made progress on contingency planning, while "a few" had submitted formal requests for licenses which are now being reviewed by the ECB or national authorities. "However, the ECB is concerned that many banks are still delaying their final decisions on restructuring their operations, with a view to keeping their options open."\par \par \uc2 She said there was a tendency to shift activities akin to banking "to investment firms or third-country branches which are out of the [eurozone supervisor's] scope, thus leading to a fragmentation of supervision and possibilities for regulatory arbitrage." She suggested that European lawmakers needed to make changes to relevant regulations.\par \par \uc2 "Significant euro area banks with a UK-footprint are also progressing in their preparations. Nevertheless, the ECB sees a need for stepping up these preparations and will continue to push banks to do so," she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Nouy was speaking to a committee of the European Parliament in Brussels.\par \par \uc2 BOJ Opinion Summary Shows Resistance to Further Easing\par \par \uc2 By Megumi Fujikawa\par \par \uc2 TOKYO\u8212\'20\'14Some \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2  policy board members are reluctant to loosen monetary conditions further despite sluggish inflation, according to a summary of opinions of the bank's policy setters released Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The resistance to easing policy further suggests new policy board member Goushi Kataoka's call for more action to spur inflation is unlikely to gain majority support from board members anytime soon.\par \par \uc2 "If the bank takes an extreme measure only for the purpose of hastening to achieve the price stability target, side effects such as an accumulation of financial imbalances and an impaired functioning of financial intermediation could arise," the summary quoted one person on the nine-member policy board as saying.\par \par \uc2 One member said additional easing would bring more side effects than any positive impact, while another member said the current policy is "most appropriate," the summary showed.\par \par \uc2 At the Oct. 30-31 meeting, Mr. Kataoka voted against keeping interest rates unchanged for the second straight meeting and recommended that the central bank keep the yield of government bonds with 15 years remaining until maturity below 0.2%. He also said the BOJ should make clear its intention to take more action if there are further delays in reaching its 2% inflation goal.\par \par \uc2 The summary of opinions submitted by board members to \uc2 Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda\uc2  around the time of the meeting doesn't identify the members by name. It showed that one member suggested the BOJ should fix the 15-year yield below 0.2% to lower interest rates on bonds with longer maturities.\par \par \uc2 The BOJ releases the summary of opinions in addition to minutes of the meetings as part of its efforts to improve communication with the public.\par \par \uc2 RBI Hit List Orders India's Banks to Act on Big Companies' Bad Debt\par \par \uc2 By Manju Dalal and Debiprasad Nayak\par \par \uc2 India's central bank\uc2  is headed for a collision with some of the country's largest companies, as it steps up pressure on banks to clean up a chronic bad-debt problem weighing on the country's economic growth.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Reserve Bank of India\uc2  has in recent weeks circulated a list of 40 companies to some of India's largest state-owned and private banks, ordering them either to resolve bad debts owed to them by the companies or to refer them to the country's bankruptcy courts by year-end.\par \par \uc2 The list, provided to The Wall Street Journal by people familiar with the situation, includes one of India's biggest consumer-electronics companies, \uc2 Videocon Industries Ltd\uc2 ., and \uc2 Jaiprakash Associates Ltd\uc2 ., a conglomerate with interests from expressways to fertilizer plants. The central bank's move follows its publication earlier this year of an initial list of 12 large Indian companies that it claims have defaulted on billions of dollars worth of loans.\par \par \uc2 Together, these 52 companies account for some 6 trillion Indian rupees ($92 billion) worth of what the \uc2 Indian central bank\uc2  says are nonperforming loans, equivalent to 4.2% of India's GDP.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Reserve Bank of India\uc2  declined to comment on the list's contents.\par \par \uc2 Many of India's banks are struggling with a legacy of bad debt that is hampering their ability to make new loans. The country's annual credit growth rate dropped to 8% in the year to March from 11% the year before, according to central bank data, its lowest for 23 years.\par \par \uc2 Analysts expect that to harm India's overall economic growth. Last month the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  cut its growth forecast for India by 0.5 percentage point to 6.7% in 2017.\par \par \uc2 "A large part of the Indian banking system is dysfunctional", said Neelkanth Mishra, India equity strategist at \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  in Mumbai, adding that banks' bad-loan problems mean they are sometimes unable to lend to healthy companies.\par \par \uc2 Despite concern within India about the financial system, money has poured into the country's stock and bond markets this year, much of it from foreign investors lured by hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will implement radical economic reforms. The benchmark Sensex stock market index is up 25% since the beginning of the year.\par \par \uc2 The drive to tackle India's bad-debt problem is part of a broader effort to improve banks' health. The government last month announced a plan to inject 2.11 trillion rupees into the country's state-owned banks during the next two years, with much of the money coming from the government directly.\par \par \uc2 But the central bank's efforts have drawn resistance, with some companies denying that they are on the list of those with heavy bad debts.\par \par \uc2 Venugopal Dhoot\uc2 , chairman of Videocon, said his company wasn't on the list of 40 companies that could be in line for bankruptcy, and said it was in talks with its bankers about its outstanding loans. "We have applied for the restructuring of our loan and it has been considered positively by the joint lenders forum," he told the Journal, referring to a group of the company's lenders.\par \par \uc2 Videocon, which has operations in telecommunications as well as the oil-and-gas sector, has seen its shares slump 86% this year amid concerns about its high debt levels. The company's net debt has risen 10-fold in the past decade, and it owes 200 billion rupees alone to \uc2 State Bank of India\uc2 , the country's largest lender.\par \par \uc2 Jaiprakash Associates\uc2 , the company behind one of India's Formula One racing tracks, is another company whose net debt has ballooned in recent years, rising fourfold to 386 billion rupees since March 2008. \uc2 State Bank of India\uc2  has lent nearly 150 billion rupees to Jaiprakash.\par \par \uc2 Jaiprakash didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Other companies on the list include infrastructure company \uc2 IVRCL Ltd\uc2 ., \uc2 Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14India's largest manufacturer of edible oil\u8212\'20\'14and construction engineering firm \uc2 Unity Infraprojects Ltd\uc2 . None of those companies responded to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 India's mostly state-owned banks stepped up their corporate lending about 15 years ago to support infrastructure-led growth in the country, only to stumble when the global financial crisis hit in 2008, followed by a bust in commodity prices a few years later.\par \par \uc2 As companies started falling back on their repayments, many banks rolled over loans to avoid declaring them as nonperforming assets. By not writing off these so-called \u8216\'20\'18zombie loans', banks have been able to avoid a hit to their profits and the need to raise extra capital.\par \par \uc2 India's government took steps to address the problem by introducing a new bankruptcy regime last year. In August, it empowered the central bank to direct banks to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against defaulting companies.\par \par \uc2 Under the new bankruptcy law, a court-appointed insolvency professional has to produce a resolution plan for a company's debts within 180 days. The deadline can be extended 90 days, but, if no acceptable plan is produced, the company will be declared insolvent.\par \par \uc2 "Earlier debt resolutions plans had only a carrot and no stick. Now, owners face a real danger of losing control over their firms," said Saswata Guha, a director with Fitch India.\par \par \uc2 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Holds Rates Steady\par \par \uc2 By Ben Collins\par \par \uc2 WELLINGTON, New Zealand\u8212\'20\'14The \uc2 Reserve Bank of New Zealand\uc2  left interest rates unchanged as expected at a policy meeting Thursday, but acknowledged a somewhat improved economic outlook supported by a sharply lower currency and rising commodity prices.\par \par \uc2 Acting \uc2 Gov. Grant Spencer\uc2  said the official cash rate had been left at a record low of 1.75%. He cited ongoing uncertainties around the outlook, not the least of which was a new Labour-led coalition government that has pledged to overhaul the workings of the central bank by broadening its mandate to include an employment objective.\par \par \uc2 The New Zealand dollar has fallen by 6% since elections in September as global investors fret over the new government's direction on key issues around migration and housing.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Spencer said modeling to assess the impact of new government policies is under way, with the key areas being new government spending, infrastructure spending, tighter visa requirements and a likely rise in the minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 The currency's retreat prompted the RBNZ to move forward its timetable for interest-rate increases slightly, but it hinted more aggressive action is likely if the currency remains weak.\par \par \uc2 "Monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable period. Numerous uncertainties remain and policy may need to adjust accordingly, " Gov. Spencer said.\par \par \uc2 "The exchange rate has eased since the August Statement and, if sustained, will increase tradables inflation and promote more balanced growth," he added.\par \par \uc2 Still, interest rates aren't expected to be moved until mid-2019.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Spencer indicated the New Zealand dollar was now much less of a headwind to higher economic growth and stronger inflation, saying current levels around 70 U.S. cents were far more sustainable.\par \par \uc2 David deGaris, senior economist at National Australia Bank, said the RBNZ has adopted "a clear tightening bias."\par \par \uc2 "They seem to have gotten rid of the notion of rate cuts in what looks to be a first step toward beginning the normalization of rates," he added.\par \par \uc2 Imre Speizer, currency strategist at \uc2 Westpac\uc2 , said the RBNZ was "certainly more hawkish" than expected by the market, and the New Zealand dollar responded by rallying sharply.\par \par \uc2 Recent data have been supportive of the RBNZ's more upbeat stance. New Zealand's consumer prices regained some strength in the third quarter, driven by rising housing costs and more expensive food. And the country's unemployment rate also fell again in the third quarter, sliding to 4.6% from 4.8% three months earlier.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the country's agriculture-rich economy bounced back from six months of anemic growth in the second quarter, supported by high migration flows, solid commodity prices and record-low interest rates. Homeowners are enjoying wealth gains through soaring property prices, which have cooled lately but remain high.\par \par \uc2 However, business confidence fell to its lowest level in two years after New Zealand's recent general election, which saw the Labour-led coalition headed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern replace the center-right government, which had been in power for nearly a decade. The reading was taken before her power-sharing agreement was finalized, leading some economists to expect it to dip even lower when the next round of data are released.\par \par \uc2 Quick Hits: Bank of Korea Member Says Policy Tightening to Happen Gradually\par \par \uc2 Bank of Korea Member: Policy to Tighten Gradually\par \par \uc2 The Bank of Korea\uc2  will likely tighten policy gradually when it takes any action, says one of its seven voting members. Hahm Joon-ho said in a press briefing that as the central bank is increasingly under pressure to start a rate-raising cycle as the economy continues to improve, the expected tapering of monetary easing would be measured given the country's aging population and slowing productivity. The pace of gains in private consumption and core inflation will be key in the timing of policy tightening, the central banker added.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Kwanwoo Jun\par \par \uc2 Bank of Thailand Doesn't Tip Hand on Future Path\par \par \uc2 Today's Bank of Thailand policy statement didn't offer much on any potential changes in stance. There have been no rate changes since April 2015, and policy makers still view things as accommodative and conducive to economic growth. A minor change in Wednesday's statement was acknowledgment of a slight uptick in consumer prices and the central bank saying it would monitor inflation gains along with improvement in domestic demand. Elsewhere, it didn't attribute 2017 gains in the baht to a falling dollar, as the central bank previously did. It instead called the pair stable since the last meeting.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Saurabh Chaturvedi\par \par \uc2 India's October Inflation Won't Leave Room to Cut\par \par \uc2 A cut in factory-gate taxes likely cooled fuel prices and brought down transport costs, helping push broader inflation down in India for October, predicts \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 . But an increase in rent allowances for state employees will keep price pressures simmering, it adds while predicting 3.2% consumer-price index growth from a year earlier, versus September's 3.3% increase. But the central bank is unlikely to draw much comfort from that and cut rates once more in December. "Moreover, the recent rise in oil prices, coupled with signs that the economic recovery is gathering momentum, will be additional reasons against further monetary easing," \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  says. Capital Economics has the same sentiment on both rates and an inflation pickup looming. October's data are due Monday.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Anant Vijay Kala\par \par \uc2 BOE Rate Rise a Mistake, \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2  AM Says\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 's rate rise last week, its first in a decade, is a mistake, BNP Paribas Asset Management says. U.K. inflation may stand much higher than the 2% target, but most of the inflation is due to weaker sterling pushing up import prices. This effect is temporary and shouldn't be sustainable. On the other hand, domestically generated inflation has remained weak, the asset manager adds. The rates market's focus now is on when the BOE will raise rates again, with few expecting it to happen until at least late 2018.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Tasos Vossos\par \par \uc2 BOE Tightening Doesn't Affect Sterling Credit's Allure\par \par \uc2 Corporate bond investors can find value in sterling investment-grade bonds, and a tightening \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  policy won't change that, according to \uc2 HSBC\uc2  strategists. A couple of BOE rate rises are unlikely to change the attraction of sterling credit's yield pickup to cash. And companies' borrowing costs are unlikely to rise due to the BOE's actions, as U.K. investment-grade companies are issuing four times as much debt in U.S. dollars than in sterling.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Tasos Vossos\par \par \uc2 ECB's Draghi Won't Raise Rates, Nordea Says\par \par \uc2 Mario Draghi will leave the helm of the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  without having raised rates, write economists at Nordea. They see quantitative easing extending into March 2019 and understand the ECB's expectation of rates to remain at current levels until "well past" the end of net purchases to mean at least six months. Thus a rate rise before the middle of 2019 is "very unlikely." The first increase of all policy rates will come in December 2019. This will be under a new ECB president as Mr. Draghi's term ends Oct. 31, 2019.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Todd Buell\par \par \uc2 Euro Traders Get Signal That First ECB Hike Is Far Away\par \par \uc2 The euro didn't benefit much from news that three \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  members\u8212\'20\'14Beno\u238\'00\'EEt Coeur\u233\'00\'E9, Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Villeroy de Galhau and Jens Weidmann\u8212\'20\'14wanted to link quantitative easing to the degree of monetary policy expansion, not just inflation. This could have paved a way toward an end to the bond-purchasing program, \uc2 Commerzbank\uc2  says. However, the fact that the "doves" on the ECB council "did not even want to accept that change" is not good news. "Until an end of the purchasing program is in sight the first rate hike seems an increasingly distant prospect," which is "bad news for EUR bulls," \uc2 Commerzbank\uc2  says.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Olga Cotaga\par \par \uc2 Peru's Central Bank\uc2  Expected to Cut Policy Rate in December\par \par \uc2 Peru's central bank\uc2  likely will leave its reference interest rate unchanged this month but cut it in December following a decline in inflation to 2%, BMI Research says. The quarter-point cut, which would help to support Peru's economic recovery as inflation hits a seven-year low, would bring the interest rate to 3.25%. BMI says it expects the central bank to hold off on further cuts in 2018, when inflation will likely average around 3%, which is the upper limit of the central bank's target range.

"This is to ensure the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy," it said.\par \par \uc2 Bank Negara Malaysia\uc2  said the global economy is likely to see sustained growth in 2018, adding that prospects are expected to remain favorable despite risks arising from geopolitical and policy developments in major economies.\par \par \uc2 Strong exports helped drive robust growth in Malaysia in the second quarter. The economy grew 5.8% in the period, its fastest pace in more than two years, prompting the government to raise its growth forecast for the year to 5.2%-5.7% from between 4.3% and 4.8%.\par \par \uc2 But recent data\u8212\'20\'14from slower-than-expected export growth in September to weaker manufacturing activity in October\u8212\'20\'14suggest that growth might lose momentum toward the year-end, providing little incentive for the central bank to tighten policy before 2018. Third-quarter gross domestic product data will be released Nov. 17.\par \par \uc2 "For 2018, domestic demand is expected to remain the key source of growth," \uc2 Bank Negara Malaysia\uc2  said Thursday.

Come next year, might their unexpectedly lengthy tenure as wards of the state come to an end?\par \par \uc2 That's a key goal of Reps. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.) and Emanuel Cleaver (D., Mo.), who have quietly begun negotiating a bipartisan deal to revamp the companies, according to people familiar with the discussions, boosting overhaul efforts that have so far remained a back-burner issue for the Trump administration and Congress. The two lawmakers are the top ranking members of a House Financial Services subcommittee focused on housing.\par \par \uc2 Notably, the pair have the blessing of Jeb Hensarling, the conservative Texas Republican who heads the full committee. Though Mr. Hensarling has repeatedly called for liquidating Fannie and Freddie, he has signaled a willingness to compromise to advance his aim of a smaller role government role in housing finance.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of the day, I'm looking for something that improves the status quo and right now that's a pretty low threshold," Mr. Hensarling said in an interview this week. The Texas lawmaker announced last month that he would retire from Congress next year, a move that coincides with the end of his tenure as head of the financial services panel.\par \par \uc2 Messrs. Duffy and Cleaver are still in the early stages of their negotiations but hope for results in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with the talks. A deal in the House could put pressure on the Senate to craft its own version of an overhaul, which has so far remained elusive despite the fact that it is a top goal for a bipartisan group of lawmakers in that chamber.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration, for its part, has also made overhauling Fannie and Freddie a top policy objective, but it isn't expected to outline its policy recommendations until next year, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mark Bednar, a spokesman for Mr. Duffy, said the Wisconsin lawmaker is working with Mr. Cleaver on a possible deal and "will continue to work with anyone on either side of the aisle who brings constructive ideas" about overhauling the companies.\par \par \uc2 "Just embracing legislation through the lens of Democratic or Republican ideology will accomplish little," Mr. Cleaver said in a written statement. "Bipartisanship, on the other hand, can produce value for the country."\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie play critical roles maintaining the plumbing of the U.S. mortgage market. They purchase loans from lenders and repackage them as securities that are insured if the loans default. The firms' regulator seized the companies through a process known as conservatorship during the George W. Bush administration, and the Treasury Department agreed to inject vast sums to support some $5 trillion in debt securities issued by the companies.\par \par \uc2 The companies have thin capital reserves under the terms of their 2008 government-backstop agreements, but they have access to a combined $258 billion in Treasury assistance. They are required to send most of their profits to Treasury in exchange for that support.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Clayton Urges Review of Shareholder Voting\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK\u8212\'20\'14The Trump administration's top securities regulator on Wednesday urged a review of how shareholders weigh in on public companies' executive pay proposals, board of director nominees and contentious issues raised by activist investors.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton told a New York legal conference that retail-investor participation in such elections is so low that it "may be a signal that our proxy process is too cumbersome and needs updating." Mr. Clayton, who took over the commission in May, said he would seek public input on how to overhaul the proxy-voting system.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, a political independent, called out one particular weapon in the proxy tool kit: shareholder proposals. Under SEC rules, shareholders who own at least $2,000 worth of company stock can submit corporate-governance proposals for a vote. Stock-exchange operator Nasdaq Inc. and many public companies say that low threshold allows dissident shareholders and critics to impose proposals on the entire investor base.\par \par \uc2 "Shareholder proposals can gain traction and lead to corporate governance changes that better track the long-term interests of Main Street investors," Mr. Clayton said at the annual Institute on Securities Regulation event. "They also create costs, including out-of-pocket costs and the use of board and management time that otherwise could be devoted to operation of the company itself."\par \par \uc2 Proxy voting is also used by activist hedge-fund managers seeking to shake up the strategies or boards of firms whose shares they own. William Ackman, for instance, lost his bid this week for three seats on the board of \uc2 Automatic Data Processing Inc\uc2 ., as ADP investors on Tuesday re-elected the entire 10-person board at its annual meeting.\par \par \uc2 While fights between activist investors and companies capture the attention of institutional investors, retail participation in many corporate elections is low. While retail investors own 30% of all shares issued by public companies, less than a third of those shares voted, Mr. Clayton said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Votes on shareholder proposals are only advisory, yet companies have long resented small shareholders' ability to draw attention to pet issues.\par \par \uc2 "The current shareholder proposal process is dominated by a limited number of individuals who file common proposals across a wide range of companies but own only a nominal amount of shares in the companies they target," the Business Roundtable wrote in a report this year.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  Chief Executive \uc2 Adena Friedman\uc2 , in a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this year said the proposals are a costly hassle to public companies. She wrote that \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  supports a legislative provision written by House Republicans that would raise the threshold to 1% of a company's shares.\par \par \uc2 Last year, 36% of all shareholder proposals that got a vote were sponsored by individual shareholders\u8212\'20\'14the type of investor whose activity would most clearly be affected by the Choice Act\u8212\'20\'14according to data from ISS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the data arm of \uc2 Institutional Shareholder Services Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Many of the proposals are sponsored by so-called gadflies\u8212\'20\'14critics who often use small stakes to push for changes at companies\u8212\'20\'14and the measures often pass. Individual investor John Chevedden, for instance, has sponsored 91 proposals since 2007 that garnered more than 50% support, ISS data shows. The average rate of support for his proposals was 39%.\par \par \uc2 The SEC hasn't weighed in on the Republican proposal to raise the bar to 1%. Mr. Clayton said he supports rules that allow shareholder proposals but acknowledged the debate divides investors and companies. He is "searching for a way to reconcile the multiple positions and find common ground," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton said the SEC is separately looking at ways to improve disclosures that investors receive from mutual funds and brokers about transaction and advice fees. The SEC has recently brought enforcement cases against \uc2 SunTrust Bank\uc2  and other companies for selling more expensive mutual-fund share classes to investors when cheaper options were available.\par \par \uc2 Noreika Signals Shift on Leveraged-Lending Enforcement\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK\u8212\'20\'14A senior U.S. regulator criticized an Obama-era crackdown on big banks' lending to heavily indebted companies, a shift in tone after a yearslong battle over lending standards.\par \par \uc2 The comments by \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , acting comptroller of the currency, were the first by a senior U.S. official since federal standards for so-called leveraged lending were thrown into legal limbo by a government auditor's ruling in October.\par \par \uc2 Regulators' standards on leveraged lending "shouldn't be binding on anyone," Mr. Noreika said in a Wednesday interview, referring to a 2013 guidance document.\par \par \uc2 "I think leveraged lending goes to the heart of safety and soundness and will always be something that examiners are interested in," Mr. Noreika said. "The criticism which is valid is whether a bank should be cited in an MRA or enforcement action because they haven't complied with the guidance."\par \par \uc2 An MRA, or matter requiring attention, is a private letter from a regulator to a banker, demanding that the banker address a perceived problem.\par \par \uc2 The comptroller's office and the Federal Reserve, two powerful U.S. banking overseers, sent such letters to big banks in recent years demanding that banks bring their standards on making leveraged loans in line with the 2013 guidance document.\par \par \uc2 The standards in that document weren't technically binding on banks, but regulators enforced them strictly. As a result, big banks have passed on financing deals that regulators viewed as out of bounds, such as some private-equity buyouts of companies with high levels of debt. The industry has been hoping for a shift under President Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noreika's comments aren't the final word on the issue since he is serving in an acting capacity. He could soon be replaced by Joseph Otting, a banker nominated to be comptroller. The Senate hasn't yet confirmed Mr. Otting and his views on leveraged lending aren't clear. The Treasury Department under Mr. Trump has said the 2013 document wasn't clear enough and regulators should reissue it.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  said regulators had erred in treating the 2013 document as voluntary guidance, rather than a formal rule. Some legal analysts have said the GAO finding means the document no longer carries any weight, but regulators have been silent on the issue.\par \par \uc2 "It has never been in effect. It is guidance. So it shouldn't be binding on anyone," Mr. Noreika said after a appearing at a conference of the Clearing House Association bank trade group.\par \par \uc2 "This was a useful exercise in reminding the regulators that guidance is guidance, and that is how it is going to have to be treated," he said. "It shouldn't be a reason to be written up. If the examiner has a problem with safety and soundness of leveraged lending, they should have a discussion with [the bank], and the guidance may be one factor they look at in deciding how they are going to address those issues."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noreika also said regulators are discussing the GAO finding and could make a joint statement about the matter in coming weeks. The guidance was issued by the OCC, the Fed and the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Representatives of the Fed and FDIC had no comment.\par \par \uc2 How Some Small Banks Are Firing the Fed\par \par \uc2 By Christina Rexrode\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  wanted to cut costs, so it ditched the Fed.\par \par \uc2 The Little Rock, Ark., bank was regulated by the Federal Reserve, the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 ., a state banking agency and others. It figured one way to reduce expenses would be to remove a layer of oversight.\par \par \uc2 So, the bank in June shed its holding-company structure, an umbrella corporation regulated by the Fed. With that gone, the Fed was out of the picture.\par \par \uc2 "We didn't really need to be regulated by both," said CEO George Gleason, referring to the FDIC and the Fed. Although the bank hasn't detailed savings, it expects to reduce administrative, accounting and regulatory costs.\par \par \uc2 Even some regulators back such moves. "Banks should be able to structure themselves in whatever way they want," \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , acting head of the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , one of the main federal bank regulators, told The Wall Street Journal. "Holding company form is an anomaly throughout the world."\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 , with roughly $21 billion in assets, is the biggest firm in recent years to make such a change. Its move has stirred interest among small banks looking to save money at a time when loan growth has often been hard to come by and superlow interest rates are squeezing profits.\par \par \uc2 BancorpSouth Bank\uc2  in Tupelo, Miss., completed a similar conversion last week. "We're spending time, money and effort with the Fed that we really don't have to," said CEO Dan Rollins. "Keep it simple."\par \par \uc2 Others are considering the strategy, too. Speaking on his bank's earnings call last month, New York Community Bancorp Inc. finance chief Thomas Cangemi said, "Do we have to stay as a bank holding company?" Changing that, he added, could be "an option going forward."\par \par \uc2 "This is taking regulatory relief into their own hands," said V. Gerard Comizio, a partner at law firm \uc2 Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP\uc2 , who said he has heard from dozens of banks interested in the transition.\par \par \uc2 It is also a way for banks to sidestep things like Fed-administered stress tests, even if they surpass a $50 billion asset threshold that usually triggers such oversight.\par \par \uc2 San Francisco-based \uc2 First Republic Bank\uc2 , for example, has grown to $84 billion in assets from $33 billion five years ago. Although it crossed the $50 billion line, First Republic doesn't undergo Fed stress testing.\par \par \uc2 First Republic executives declined to comment but have bragged about their structure in calls with analysts and investors. "We keep it very, very simple," CEO \uc2 James Herbert\uc2  told an industry conference in late 2015. "We don't even have a holding company."\par \par \uc2 New York-based \uc2 Signature Bank\uc2  is another firm that doesn't have a holding company. Although at $41 billion in assets it hasn't crossed the $50 billion mark, executives note the benefit of a streamlined structure. "We're so heavily regulated to begin with -- why would you add on to that?" said Executive Vice President \uc2 Eric Howell\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Granted, not all banks can get rid of their holding companies. Banks that engage in certain riskier activities, such as securities underwriting, must have a holding company to keep those units separate from the one holding bank deposits.\par \par \uc2 The simpler structure also holds some potential drawbacks. For example, banks without a holding-company structure have less flexibility to invest in other companies. That could be a turnoff for firms that want to buy stakes in financial-technology firms, said Chip MacDonald, a partner at law firm \uc2 Jones Day\uc2  who is working with banks considering such a move.\par \par \uc2 Smaller community banks also can hold higher levels of debt if they operate under holding companies, which can help with mergers.\par \par \uc2 A holding company is essentially a parent organization for a bank and its related entities, and about 80% of U.S. banks and thrifts operate under this structure. But in recent years, the benefits from such an arrangement have shrunk while regulatory costs have risen.\par \par \uc2 Many banks adopted the holding-company structure in the 1980s so they could do business across state lines. Banks today no longer need a holding company to do so.\par \par \uc2 Other banks created holding companies to get more flexibility to count various forms of capital toward their regulatory benchmarks. Post-financial-crisis regulatory changes curbed that benefit.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gleason described shedding \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 ' holding company the way he shed an unused lake house: "I got rid of it too," he said. "We hadn't used it for anything for years."\par \par \uc2 To make the change, \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  merged its parent company into its bank. It had to hold a shareholder vote and file merger applications with the FDIC and state banking regulators, but it didn't need the Fed's permission.\par \par \uc2 Eliminating the holding company structure holds other benefits. A holding company generally requires a separate set of financial results, its own board meetings and oversight of transactions between the holding company and the bank.\par \par \uc2 Plus, banks, unlike bank holding companies, don't file quarterly and annual reports with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . Instead they file with bank regulators. The FDIC also doesn't charge a registration fee when banks issue new shares, as the SEC does, \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Having one less regulator could also speed up some processes, such as getting mergers approved. That was an important consideration to \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 , which has gobbled up rivals and quintupled its assets in the past five years.\par \par \uc2 Such moves have caused some concern banks could shop for more lenient regulators, engaging in regulatory arbitrage. That became an issue before the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2  and other firms counter by saying the FDIC isn't a lenient regulator. The FDIC and Federal Reserve don't have an official position on holding-company changes.\par \par \uc2 "It might be arbitrage," Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of policy-analysis firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 ., said of banks changing their structure. "But it's also a huge boost to their challenged earnings."\par \par \uc2 Powell Confirmation Hearing Set For Nov. 28\par \par \uc2 By Kate Davidson\par \par \uc2 The Senate Banking Committee will meet Nov. 28 to consider the nomination of Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to be the next central bank chairman, the panel announced Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump announced last week he intends to nominate Mr. Powell to take the helm of the Fed in early February, when Chairwoman Janet Yellen's term expires.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell has been through the Senate confirmation process before, most recently in 2012 and 2014 when he was nominated to join the Fed board. His nomination is expected to receive bipartisan support, though some GOP lawmakers have indicated they have concerns about his support for Fed policies under Ms. Yellen.

Speaking at a banking conference, he said regulators could solicit public comment on changes to the Volcker rule as early as the spring, and regulators should propose changes recommended by the Treasury Department while looking for banks to provide evidence that exempting them from the rule wouldn't cause undue risks. "There is a question of will there ever be the data to support using the exemptions" Mr. Noreika said, referring to exemptions Congress outlined when it told regulators to write the Volcker rule in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. "I am of the view we should actually ask the question to people."\par \par \uc2 Equifax CEO to Congress: Not Sure We Are Encrypting Data\par \par \uc2 By Robert McMillan and AnnaMaria Andriotis\par \par \uc2 Two months after \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . reported one of the worst data breaches in history, its interim chief executive told a congressional hearing Wednesday he wasn't sure whether the company was encrypting consumer data.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  announced Sept. 7 it was breached and that hackers accessed data including names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers for 145.5 million U.S. consumers. Several executives, including the CEO, stepped aside in the wake of the disclosure.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  has quadrupled spending on security, updated its security tools and changed its corporate structure since the breach, Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., the interim chief, said during a hearing by the Senate Commerce Committee.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Barros stumbled when asked by Sen. Cory Gardner (R., Colo) whether \uc2 Equifax\uc2  was now encrypting the consumer data it stored on its computers\u8212\'20\'14a basic step in hiding sensitive information from hackers, and one the company previously had admitted it didn't take before the breach.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know at this stage," Mr. Barros said.\par \par \uc2 The answer was disappointing, said Avivah Litan, an analyst with the research firm \uc2 Gartner Inc\uc2 . "He should have asked his staff that the day he took over," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Barros has been Equifax's CEO since Sept. 26, when the company announced \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  was retiring. Before that, Mr. Barros was head of the company's Asia-Pacific business.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  is in the process of "either encrypting or deleting" data stored on its computer storage systems, an Equifax spokeswoman said in an email. Since the breach, "\uc2 Equifax\uc2  has deployed multiple methodologies to strengthen security and protect data," she said.\par \par \uc2 Since the breach was announced, nearly 32 million unique visitors have used \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's website to go through the process of confirming whether their information was compromised, the company said. That represents approximately 22% of the affected U.S. consumers.\par \par \uc2 The breach is seen by some as a watershed moment for the credit-reporting industry. Lawmakers during the hearing said they were contemplating a variety of legislative responses, including a national breach-disclosure law and federal data-safety requirements.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's data-breach hearing also included testimony from former \uc2 Yahoo Inc\uc2 . AABA -1.47% CEO \uc2 Marissa Mayer\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mayer apologized for a series of breaches that compromised 3 billion \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  user accounts, but said companies today face advanced adversaries.

Critics say that if approved by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , the service could enable sophisticated algorithmic traders to exploit investors.\par \par \uc2 "In the interest of fairness and the investing public, this initiative should be denied by the regulator," Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman and chief executive of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and one of the pioneers of automated options trading, said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Exchanges in recent years have sought to boost profits by selling data, often reaching into the torrent of electronic trading activity that rushes through their markets for data to package and sell.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  PHLX is the second-biggest U.S. options exchange. Some 12 to 14 billion digital messages a day zip through its systems, representing trades and other information, according to \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Intellicator\u8212\'20\'14a combination of the words "intelligent indicator"--would use that activity to gauge market sentiment. Every minute, it would spit out numbers corresponding to a part of the options market and show whether investors in that market segment were bullish or bearish.\par \par \uc2 While it wouldn't reveal the identities of investors, the Intellicator could reveal the "customer type" of buyers or sellers in thinly traded markets. For instance, it could show whether a trade was initiated by a small investor or big money manager, by identifying certain traders as "professional customers" who place larger volumes of orders each day.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  said in a September SEC filing that, in some cases, the Intellicator could be used to "reverse-engineer" the strategies of certain kinds of firms, yielding information "not otherwise available on the Exchange's data feeds."\par \par \uc2 That could harm pension funds and other institutional investors, for whom it is critical to get big trades done quietly, said Peter Maragos, chief executive of Dash Financial Technologies, an equities and options brokerage.\par \par \uc2 When such big investors want to buy or sell large quantities of options, their brokers will often break the order into chunks and execute them throughout the day. The idea is to avoid tipping off the market about the large investor's intentions.\par \par \uc2 But if the Intellicator reveals a small order was initiated by a big investor, others could infer that the investor is about to buy or sell many options, potentially affecting the price of the underlying stock. An algo trader could quickly buy or sell that stock, resulting in a worse price for the investor on the options, Mr. Maragos said.\par \par \uc2 "We don't see how this benefits investors in any way," he said.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  says it is actually trying to "democratize" options data, or level the playing field between high-tech traders and ordinary investors. The New York exchange operator consulted with dozens of its customers before unveiling the Intellicator and sought to minimize the risk of exposing anyone's secrets, said Jeff Kimsey, \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's head of global data products.\par \par \uc2 Customer-type data is available elsewhere, and savvy traders already use it, he said, though he added that no other source releases such data as frequently as every 60 seconds, as the Intellicator would.\par \par \uc2 Some market veterans say the Intellicator proposal won't have as much impact as critics fear. "What \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  is trying to do is add a little more transparency," said Henry Schwartz, president of options data firm Trade Alert LLC. "But I don't think they're overdoing it."\par \par \uc2 The SEC has until Nov. 18 to respond to \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's plan, though it could just decide to delay a decision for months.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  unveiled the Intellicator in an August SEC filing, but withdrew that filing less than two weeks later. When it filed an expanded version in September, it included the material about how the Intellicator could help reverse-engineer hidden trading strategies. Mr. Kimsey said \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  added those sections after talking to the SEC. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The clash comes as the arcane business of exchange data feeds has come under growing scrutiny, even drawing attention from the administration of President Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 Banks and trading firms complain \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  and the New York Stock Exchange unfairly use their access to raw market data to sell ever-costlier "data products." \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  and the NYSE counter that their pricing is fair and that they are only responding to growing demand for data in today's electronic markets.\par \par \uc2 But on Oct. 6, the Treasury Department sided with the exchanges' critics, stating in a report that "limited constraints on exchange pricing power [have] allowed exchanges to regularly raise prices." Shares of \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  dropped 4.8% that day, while shares of NYSE owner \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange Inc\uc2 . fell 2.7%.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  has also faced allegations that it gives some traders an unfair edge by selling data feeds that shed light on other firms' trading activities.\par \par \uc2 Last week, it stopped offering a package of data feeds called \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  after customers complained that it revealed "too much information about the trading strategies of participants on the Exchange," \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  said in an Oct. 30 filing. \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  said it didn't think the complaints were justified, but terminated the package anyway, calling it "potentially controversial."\par \par \uc2 The stakes are higher than one new data feed, observers say. If the SEC backs the Intellicator, \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 's rivals will likely launch copycats, said Jim Toes, head of the Security Traders Association, a financial-services trade group.\par \par \uc2 Data has grown increasingly important to exchanges, he added.

They allow for banks and risk-hungry investors like hedge funds to obtain short-term cash at cheap rates in exchange for safe collateral.\par \par \uc2 The spike indicates Spanish banks were losing retail deposits, a source of long-term stable funding, traders said, and piling into wholesale money markets in search of an alternative source.\par \par \uc2 Although banks said the outflows were small, the issue underscores the potential problems for Spain's economy as the standoff continues. Madrid in late October took full control of the Catalan regional government and jailed local officials.\par \par \uc2 And while investors have sold Catalan bank stocks, the repo market offers a rare glimpse into the effects on the sector's all-important depositors.\par \par \uc2 According to transactions processed by the BrokerTec platform operated by NEX Markets, volumes in European repo markets rose 30% in October from a year earlier, after a similar rise in September. The move was concentrated in Spain and is likely explained by the Catalan push for independence, NEX said.\par \par \uc2 The day after the vote, BrokerTec registered its highest daily volumes on record of term repo\u8212\'20\'14funding of a maturity greater than one day, the most common in repo markets\u8212\'20\'14hitting \u8364\'20\'AC1.14 trillion ($1.32 trillion).\par \par \uc2 Some Spanish banks confirmed they aggressively tapped wholesale markets in the week that followed the vote, as well as ensuring their access to the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 's liquidity, largely to assuage the fears of large, wealthy depositors.\par \par \uc2 Outflows mostly stopped after that week, they added, especially after Catalonia's two flagship banks\u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 CaixaBank SA\uc2  and \uc2 Banco de Sabadell SA\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14said they were moving their legal headquarters away from the restive region. Around 2,200 companies have followed suit since the referendum, figures from the Spanish College of Mercantile Registers show.\par \par \uc2 In October, "\uc2 Banco de Sabadell\uc2  didn't lead any extraordinary operation in the wholesale market beyond the increase driven by all Spanish banks in aggregate," a spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 "We did see some movements of deposits during a few days, but really nothing material and things have really normalized after that," \uc2 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA\uc2  Managing Director Carlos Torres said.\par \par \uc2 CaixaBank\uc2  declined to comment, but Managing Director \uc2 Gonzalo Gort\u225\'00\'E1zar\uc2  said two weeks ago the lender suffered "a moderate loss of customer funds," but that it was "halted" after the decision to move the legal headquarters.\par \par \uc2 "It really puts us in the same position at any other Spanish bank that is now doing business in Catalonia," Mr. Gort\u225\'00\'E1zar said.\par \par \uc2 Part of the growth in European repo markets can also be explained by banks adapting to new regulations: The size of the market was \u8364\'20\'AC6.4 trillion at the end of June, compared with \u8364\'20\'AC5.4 trillion in June 2016, according to the \uc2 International Capital Market Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The political uncertainty surrounding the independence drive has roiled local markets. Since the start of September, Spain's IBEX-35 stock market has dropped 1.1%, compared with a 4.7% gain for the broader Stoxx Europe 600.\par \par \uc2 Sabadell and \uc2 CaixaBank\uc2  are both down around 10% during this period, while shares in \uc2 BBVA\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14now the top bank in the region by market share, despite its non-Catalan origins\u8212\'20\'14have dropped 3.4%. By comparison, the wider index of eurozone lenders has traded broadly flat.\par \par \uc2 After Catalan banks moved their headquarters, some pro-independence activists called for a boycott of the lenders, but the impact on markets hasn't been noticeable.\par \par \uc2 While the crisis could hurt the profitability of Spanish banks, access to the ECB makes major liquidity troubles unlikely, analysts said.\par \par \uc2 Spain has been the star performer in the eurozone in the last couple of years, but the \uc2 Bank of Spain\uc2  warned last week that the Catalan crisis could end up detracting up to 2.5 percentage points from the nation's gross domestic product between this year and 2019\u8212\'20\'14a 60% reduction in expected growth.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Texas Voters Approve Raffles To Promote Saving At Banks\par \par \uc2 Voters in Texas on Tuesday approved a step to allow financial institutions to conduct raffles to promote saving. Proposition 7, one of the seven amendments to the state Constitution on the latest ballot, easily cleared the hurdle, with 60% of voters approving it, according to state officials. Texas can now join more than a dozen states that allow banks and credit unions to offer chances to win cash prizes to customers who open new accounts and keep adding money to them.

Come next year, might their unexpectedly lengthy tenure as wards of the state come to an end?\par \par \uc2 That's a key goal of Reps. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.) and Emanuel Cleaver (D., Mo.), who have quietly begun negotiating a bipartisan deal to revamp the companies, according to people familiar with the discussions, boosting overhaul efforts that have so far remained a back-burner issue for the Trump administration and Congress. The two lawmakers are the top ranking members of a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://financialservices.house.gov/115th-congress-subcommittees/housing-and-insurance.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 House Financial Services subcommittee focused on housing}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Notably, the pair have the blessing of Jeb Hensarling, the conservative Texas Republican who heads the full committee. Though Mr. Hensarling has repeatedly called for liquidating Fannie and Freddie, he has signaled a willingness to compromise to advance his aim of a smaller role government role in housing finance.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of the day, I'm looking for something that improves the status quo and right now that's a pretty low threshold," Mr. Hensarling said in an interview this week. The Texas lawmaker announced last month that he would {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-rep-jeb-hensarling-of-texas-wont-seek-re-election-1509475403"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 retire from Congress}}}\uc2  next year, a move that coincides with the end of his tenure as head of the financial services panel.\par \par \uc2 Messrs. Duffy and Cleaver are still in the early stages of their negotiations but hope for results in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with the talks. A deal in the House could put pressure on the Senate to craft its own version of an overhaul, which has so far remained elusive despite the fact that it is a top goal for a bipartisan group of lawmakers in that chamber.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration, for its part, has also made overhauling Fannie and Freddie a top policy objective, but it isn't expected to outline its policy recommendations until next year, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mark Bednar, a spokesman for Mr. Duffy, said the Wisconsin lawmaker is working with Mr. Cleaver on a possible deal and "will continue to work with anyone on either side of the aisle who brings constructive ideas" about overhauling the companies.\par \par \uc2 "Just embracing legislation through the lens of Democratic or Republican ideology will accomplish little," Mr. Cleaver said in a written statement. "Bipartisanship, on the other hand, can produce value for the country."\par \par \uc2 Fannie and Freddie play critical roles maintaining the plumbing of the U.S. mortgage market. They purchase loans from lenders and repackage them as securities that are insured if the loans default. The firms' regulator seized the companies through a process known as conservatorship during the George W. Bush administration, and the Treasury Department agreed to inject vast sums to support some $5 trillion in debt securities issued by the companies.\par \par \uc2 The companies have thin capital reserves under the terms of their 2008 government-backstop agreements, but they have access to a combined $258 billion in Treasury assistance. They are required to send most of their profits to Treasury in exchange for that support.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Clayton Urges Review of Shareholder Voting\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/secs-clayton-urges-review-of-shareholder-voting-1510152603"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Trump administration's top securities regulator}}}\uc2  on Wednesday urged a review of how shareholders weigh in on public companies' executive pay proposals, board of director nominees and contentious issues raised by activist investors.\par \par \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton told a New York legal conference that retail-investor participation in such elections is so low that it "may be a signal that our proxy process is too cumbersome and needs updating." Mr. Clayton, who took over the commission in May, said he would seek public input on how to overhaul the proxy-voting system.\par \par \uc2 Votes on shareholder proposals are only advisory, yet companies have long resented small shareholders' ability to draw attention to pet issues.\par \par \uc2 Noreika Signals Shift on Leveraged-Lending Enforcement\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-signals-shift-on-leveraged-lending-enforcement-1510161795"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A senior U.S. regulator criticized}}}\uc2  his predecessor's crackdown on big banks' lending to heavily indebted companies, a shift in tone after a yearslong battle over lending standards.\par \par \uc2 The comments by \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , acting comptroller of the currency, were the first by a senior U.S. official since federal standards for so-called leveraged lending were thrown into legal limbo by a government auditor's ruling in October.\par \par \uc2 Regulators' standards on leveraged lending "shouldn't be binding on anyone," Mr. Noreika said in a Wednesday interview, referring to a 2013 guidance document. His predecessor, former Comptroller \uc2 Thomas Curry\uc2 , enforced those standards aggressively.\par \par \uc2 How Some Small Banks Are Firing the Fed\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-some-small-banks-are-firing-the-fed-1510223401"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks wanted to cut costs}}}\uc2 , so it ditched the Fed.\par \par \uc2 The Little Rock, Ark., bank was regulated by the Federal Reserve, the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 ., a state banking agency and others. It figured one way to reduce expenses would be to remove a layer of oversight. So, the bank in June shed its holding-company structure, an umbrella corporation regulated by the Fed. With that gone, the Fed was out of the picture.\par \par \uc2 Bank of the Ozarks\uc2 , with roughly $21 billion in assets, is the biggest firm in recent years to make such a change.

Speaking at a banking conference, he said regulators could solicit public comment on changes to the Volcker rule as early as the spring, and regulators should propose changes recommended by the Treasury Department while looking for banks to provide evidence that exempting them from the rule wouldn't cause undue risks. "There is a question of will there ever be the data to support using the exemptions" Mr. Noreika said, referring to exemptions Congress outlined when it told regulators to write the Volcker rule in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. "I am of the view we should actually ask the question to people."\par \par \uc2 Equifax CEO to Congress: Not Sure We Are Encrypting Data\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-ceo-to-congress-not-sure-we-are-encrypting-data-1510180486"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Two months after Equifax Inc.}}}\uc2  reported one of the worst data breaches in history, its interim chief executive told a congressional hearing Wednesday he wasn't sure whether the company was encrypting consumer data.\par \par \uc2 Equifax has quadrupled spending on security, updated its security tools and changed its corporate structure since the breach, Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., the interim chief, said during a hearing by the Senate Commerce Committee.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Barros's answer on encryption was disappointing, said Avivah Litan, an analyst with the research firm \uc2 Gartner Inc\uc2 .

They allow for banks and risk-hungry investors like hedge funds to obtain short-term cash at cheap rates in exchange for safe collateral. The spike indicates Spanish banks were losing retail deposits, a source of long-term stable funding, traders said, and piling into wholesale money markets in search of an alternative source. Although banks said the outflows were small, the issue underscores the potential problems for Spain's economy as the standoff continues.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Texas Voters Approve Raffles To Promote Saving At Banks\par \par \uc2 Voters in Texas on Tuesday approved a step to allow financial institutions to conduct raffles to promote saving. Proposition 7, one of the seven amendments to the state Constitution on the latest ballot, easily cleared the hurdle, with 60% of voters approving it, according to state officials. Texas can now join more than a dozen states that allow banks and credit unions to offer chances to win cash prizes to customers who open new accounts and keep adding money to them. The Texas Constitution bans lotteries, with some exceptions. The proposition authorized the state legislature to carve out an exception for such savings products.\par \par \uc2 What Has Driven Markets Since Election Day\par \par \uc2 U.S. stocks have surged since Donald Trump's election a year ago.

There\u8217\'20\'19s a lot of \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and mechanisation that we can do.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan said the ratio of front office, revenue-generating staff, to back office people who keep the bank\u8217\'20\'19s systems running, was \u8220\'20\'1Cout of kilter\u8221\'20\'1D at Deutsche.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Jes Staley\uc2 , \uc2 Barclays\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 new chief executive, tackled the high cost base he inherited with a hiring freeze, Mr Cryan described Deutsche as having a \u8220\'20\'1Chiring frost\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Once the world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest investment bank, Deutsche\u8217\'20\'19s star has been on the wane for years as post-crisis regulation made the bank\u8217\'20\'19s mighty fixed income business less profitable and big misconduct fines and high legacy costs hit the bottom line.\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Despite a vow to cut \u8364\'20\'AC3bn from its cost base under Strategy 2020, the German lender made a return on tangible equity of 4 per cent for the third quarter of this year, far short of its medium-term 10 per cent target.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan, who has raised \u8364\'20\'AC8bn of capital since he took over Deutsche in mid-2015 and has settled many of the bank\u8217\'20\'19s most painful litigation issues, has come under fire from investors over Deutsche\u8217\'20\'19s poor operating performance. The bank\u8217\'20\'19s share price has almost halved under his tenure.\par \par \uc2 Critics have questioned his blunt messaging, which they say has demotivated staff, contributing to key departures and a decline in revenue. At a conference in September, he said the bank\u8217\'20\'19s accountants \u8220\'20\'1Cspend a lot of the time basically being an abacus\u8221\'20\'1D and were ripe for being automated.\par \par \uc2 The plain-speaking Briton told the FT there was \u8220\'20\'1Can easy\u8221\'20\'1D opportunity to save money by collaborating with rivals in the area of crime prevention and detection. \u8220\'20\'1CEvery bank at the moment has a huge and burgeoning department of people who are doing the same stuff. It\u8217\'20\'19s not a source of competitive advantage and you\u8217\'20\'19re exposed to making your own mistakes.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Last month, Deutsche promised savings of \u8364\'20\'AC900m from integrating its retail network with that of Postbank, its German retail banking subsidiary, which it originally planned to spin off but decided this year to keep. The cuts will take three to four years for Deutsche to fully realise.\par \par \uc2 Mr Cryan said there was a lot of scope to close branches, suggesting many Postbank customers could be shifted online. \u8220\'20\'1CThe truth is if I went to a load of branches, I\u8217\'20\'19d wait quite a lot of the day before I encountered [any] customers. They just don\u8217\'20\'19t come in as often as they used to.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171108edb8001gw\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Shareholders at \uc2 Procter & Gamble\uc2  also rebuffed a board seat bid by \uc2 Nelson Peltz\uc2 's \uc2 Trian Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Carlos Rodriguez\uc2 , chief executive of ADP, said at the meeting: "Bill, despite your characterisation of the result as close, what I was told was, this was an 'ass whooping'."\par \par \uc2 He said the battle with Mr Ackman had "sharpened our focus on the importance of insightful, strategic engagement with our investors, which, over the past few months, has given us a greater appreciation of our owners' perspectives on our business and growth plans".\par \par \uc2 Mr Ackman said: "Let me first just say that we came in peace. When we invested in ADP, we did so because we believed that ADP was a great company with a wonderful legacy, but an uncertain future. We believed that the company had underachieved its potential and that we could help ADP address the issues and shortcomings we had identified."\par \par \uc2 The fight began in August, when ADP disclosed that Mr Ackman's Pershing Square fund had taken a stake. It came at a time when the fund had been struggling. After returning 36.9 per cent in 2014, it was down 16.2 per cent in 2015 and finished last year down 9.6 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The ADP chief executive said he had "no disagreement with the themes" that Mr Ackman had raised, but that the company was already making large investments in technology and was focusing on data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and opportunities from changes to the way people were employed and paid.\par \par \uc2 Mr Rodriguez then dubbed Mr Ackman a "spoiled brat" in a television interview and complained that the activist had sought an extension of time from the board to nominate directors because he was going on holiday and needed more time to finish his presentation.\par \par \uc2 Pershing Square holds 8 per cent of ADP. It has invested about 25 per cent of its money in ADP, its largest investment.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that LendingClub is temporarily halting certain loans. In fact, it is limiting these loans and halting their sale to investors. In addition, the article stated that LendingClub is not on the hook for credit losses, when this true for the vast majority but not all losses. (Nov. 8, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Lenders should be judged not on how fast they grow during good times, but how they perform in periods like today when consumer defaults are ticking up. On that basis, \uc2 LendingClub\uc2  looks unprepared and investors are right to be skeptical of the online lender.\par \par \uc2 Following a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lendingclub-ceo-resigns-over-sales-review-1462795070"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sales practice scandal }}}\uc2 that felled its founder and chief executive last year, \uc2 LendingClub{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lendingclub-wheres-the-growth-1494000744"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 took a full year }}}\uc2 to restore trust with investors and return to a growth path. Now, worries about the quality of its loans are sinking the stock again. Shares plunged by 20% on Wednesday morning after the company lowered its full-year earnings forecast slightly.\par \par \uc2 LendingClub\uc2 , the most prominent of the online lenders, said {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lendingclubs-newest-problem-its-borrowers-1468265212"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 loans to certain borrowers}}}\uc2  at the low end of the prime credit spectrum "are not currently meeting our expectations." It will start limiting these loans, which account for around 3% of total loans, and temporarily halt their sale to investors. It will also temporarily halt this lending, which accounts for around 3% of its total loans, and also adopt a new credit model that tightens criteria for these borrowers. Unlisted peer Prosper recently took similar steps to tighten credit, analysts at Compass Point Research and Trading said in a note.\par \par \uc2 LendingClub\uc2  itself isn't on the hook for the vast majority of credit losses\u8212\'20\'14it originates credit card refinancing and other loans and then sell them on to investors. But if losses are higher than expected, loan buyers won't be happy. Tighter standards mean slower growth, hence the company's lower guidance.\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive \uc2 Scott Sanborn\uc2  cited a new environment where rising consumer indebtedness is leading to credit losses despite a strong economy. Indeed, total consumer credit as a percentage of household disposable income rose to a new high in September, according to \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  data. But these worries {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-risk-of-rising-consumer-borrowing-1492441541"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 don't come out of the blue\u8212\'20\'14}}}\uc2 they have weighed on shares of lenders like \uc2 Capital One\uc2  and \uc2 Synchrony Financial{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-lenders-get-too-much-credit-1508883007"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 all year.}}}\par \par \uc2 Online lenders' credit models, which analyze various factors beyond traditional credit scores, are supposedly one of their core strengths. That loans are performing worse than expected at \uc2 LendingClub\uc2  is a sign the models might be flawed.\par \par \uc2 LendingClub\uc2  boasted Tuesday of using "the latest \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques" to build a new model. But among the specific changes it cited were that "we now look at a borrower's credit behavior over time instead of a snapshot." This seems like something they should have been doing all along.\par \par \uc2 The past two years have been a series of disappointments for online players that were supposed to disrupt the lending landscape. Investors are now saying they fear more disappointments to come.\par \par \uc2 Write to Aaron Back at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:aaron.back@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 aaron.back@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171108edb80050l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Mr. Clayton, who took over the commission in May, said he would seek public input on how to overhaul the proxy-voting system.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton, a political independent, called out one particular weapon in the proxy tool kit: shareholder proposals. Under SEC rules, shareholders who own at least $2,000 worth of company stock can submit corporate-governance proposals for a vote. Stock-exchange operator Nasdaq Inc. and many public companies say that low threshold allows dissident shareholders and critics to impose proposals on the entire investor base.\par \par \uc2 "Shareholder proposals can gain traction and lead to corporate governance changes that better track the long-term interests of Main Street investors," Mr. Clayton said at the annual Institute on Securities Regulation event. "They also create costs, including out-of-pocket costs and the use of board and management time that otherwise could be devoted to operation of the company itself."\par \par \uc2 Proxy voting is also used by activist hedge-fund managers seeking to shake up the strategies or boards of firms whose shares they own. William Ackman, for instance, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-william-ackman-loses-bid-for-adp-board-seats-1510061281"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 lost his bid this week}}}\uc2  for three seats on the board of \uc2 Automatic Data Processing Inc\uc2 ., as ADP investors on Tuesday re-elected the entire 10-person board at its annual meeting.\par \par \uc2 While fights between activist investors and companies capture the attention of institutional investors, retail participation in many corporate elections is low. While retail investors own 30% of all shares issued by public companies, less than a third of those shares voted, Mr. Clayton said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Votes on shareholder proposals are only advisory, yet companies have long resented small shareholders' ability to draw attention to pet issues.\par \par \uc2 "The current shareholder proposal process is dominated by a limited number of individuals who file common proposals across a wide range of companies but own only a nominal amount of shares in the companies they target," the Business Roundtable wrote in a report this year.\par \par \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  Chief Executive \uc2 Adena Friedman\uc2 , in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaqs-blueprint-for-a-new-era-of-trading-1493852688"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Wall Street Journal op-ed }}}\uc2 earlier this year said the proposals are a costly hassle to public companies. She wrote that \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  supports a legislative provision written by House Republicans that would raise the threshold to 1% of a company's shares.\par \par \uc2 Last year, 36% of all shareholder proposals that got a vote were sponsored by individual shareholders\u8212\'20\'14the type of investor whose activity would most clearly be affected by the Choice Act\u8212\'20\'14according to data from ISS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the data arm of \uc2 Institutional Shareholder Services Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Many of the proposals are sponsored by so-called gadflies\u8212\'20\'14critics who often use small stakes to push for changes at companies\u8212\'20\'14and the measures often pass. Individual investor John Chevedden, for instance, has sponsored 91 proposals since 2007 that garnered more than 50% support, ISS data shows. The average rate of support for his proposals was 39%.\par \par \uc2 The SEC hasn't weighed in on the Republican proposal to raise the bar to 1%. Mr. Clayton said he supports rules that allow shareholder proposals but acknowledged the debate divides investors and companies. He is "searching for a way to reconcile the multiple positions and find common ground," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clayton said the SEC is separately looking at ways to improve disclosures that investors receive from mutual funds and brokers about transaction and advice fees. The SEC has recently brought enforcement cases against \uc2 SunTrust Bank\uc2  and other companies for selling more expensive mutual-fund share classes to investors when cheaper options were available.\par \par \uc2 Write to Dave Michaels at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:dave.michaels@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dave.michaels@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROFR20171108edb80008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

A number of company executives are accompanying Mr. Trump to China.\par \par \uc2 China's overall trade surplus climbed to $38.2 billion from September's $28.5 billion, according to data released Wednesday by the General Administration of Customs. Economists were expecting a $40 billion surplus for October.\par \par \uc2 Helped by a recovery in global demand, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-exports-rebound-sharply-as-global-demand-grows-1486707312"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 China's exports have regained momentum}}}\uc2  this year.\par \par \uc2 China's exports rose 6.1% in October from a year earlier, compared with an 8.1% increase in September. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 7% rise.\par \par \uc2 Imports expanded 17.2%, compared with a gain of 18.7% in September and a forecast for a 16.3% gain.\par \par \uc2 China's robust domestic demand has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-this-is-a-trade-war-chinas-winning-1506418206"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 given Beijing more bargaining chips over Washington}}}\uc2 , said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho.\par \par \uc2 "China doesn't have to rely on the U.S. market, but American companies do need the Chinese market," he said, referring to the group of executives accompanying Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Jake Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents more than 200 American companies doing business in China, said trade deficits are a bad barometer for measuring the health of the U.S.-China commercial relationship and is a flawed proxy for fair and open trade.\par \par \uc2 "We should boost American exports to China by pursuing policies that reduce the trade and market-access barriers that China uses to keep out American manufactured goods, services, and agriculture products," he said.\par \par \uc2 Fewer working days in October and environmental-protection measures at some local governments may have curbed China's production and export growth last month, said Betty Wang, an economist at ANZ.\par \par \uc2 "We are still pretty comfortable with China's exports outlook, which is consistent with the overall exports strength in Asia," she said. She said that while the Trump visit could yield some business deals, the trade imbalance will need more time to be resolved.\par \par \uc2 Chen Jianxi, sales manager at Shenzhen Asoutek Technology Co., which sells smart kitchen appliances to Hong Kong, Macau and the U.S., said the company has been hit by the government's heightened environment-protection regulation, which has increased raw-material costs, but it still plans to expand in the U.S.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial Intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  "is the big trend now, especially in a country where labor costs are so high.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Your editorial "Game of Health-Care Thrones" (Oct. 30) describes the motives that may have fed the proposed CVS-\uc2 Aetna\uc2  merger and the outcomes that could result from it. Whether in response to government regulation, market dynamics, the consumer revolution or other factors, the business of health care is moving rapidly beyond the model we've become accustomed to. Individual actors (like CVS and \uc2 Aetna\uc2 ) are broadening their roles, and disrupters like Amazon are making moves that could turn health-care delivery upside down. We've seen this coming for a while now -- hospital systems that double as insurers (Kaiser), retailers that provide health-care services (CVS), and the shift is about to accelerate dramatically. Are we ready?\par \par \uc2 The CVS-\uc2 Aetna\uc2  merger is a double-edged sword. We've long known the market is going to outstrip the government in transforming health-care delivery. And while the combined data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  resulting from the merger of a leading insurer and a leading national pharmacy chain have the potential to benefit patients and consumers, sadly the converse is often true. But regulation isn't the answer. It's time for the feds to step back and enable innovation that produces a system for the future. It's time for the major health-care industries -- hospitals, insurers, pharmacy and others -- to become truly consumer facing. And it's time for consumers to demand health care that actually makes them healthy when they need it, where they need it.\par \par \uc2 Stephen K.

Shareholders at \uc2 Procter & Gamble\uc2  also rebuffed a board seat bid by \uc2 Nelson Peltz\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Trian Partners\uc2 . That vote last month was much closer, with the tally going down to the wire.\par \par \uc2 Carlos Rodriguez\uc2 , chief executive of ADP, said at the meeting: \u8220\'20\'1CBill, despite your characterisation of the result as close, what I was told was this was an \u8216\'20\'18ass whooping\u8217\'20\'19.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He said the battle with Mr Ackman had \u8220\'20\'1Csharpened our focus on the importance of insightful, strategic engagement with our investors, which, over the past few months, has given us a greater appreciation of our owners\u8217\'20\'19 perspectives on our business and growth plans\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Despite a testy battle with ADP, Mr Ackman said: \u8220\'20\'1CLet me first just say that we came in peace.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen we invested in ADP, we did so because we believed that ADP was a great company with a wonderful legacy, but an uncertain future. We believed that the company had underachieved its potential, and that we could help ADP address the issues and shortcomings we had identified.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Ackman said that by his calculations he won 31 per cent of the votes of shareholders who voted either for him or director Eric Fast, who was the ADP nominee who won with the least votes.\par \par \uc2 The fight began in August when ADP disclosed that Mr Ackman\u8217\'20\'19s Pershing Square Fund had taken a stake.\par \par \uc2 The ADP chief executive said he had \u8220\'20\'1Cno disagreement with the themes\u8221\'20\'1D that Mr Ackman had raised, but that the company was already making large investments in technology and was focusing on data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and opportunities from changes to the way people were employed and paid.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Mr Rodriguez then dubbed Mr Ackman a \u8220\'20\'1Cspoiled brat\u8221\'20\'1D in a television interview and complained that the activist had sought an extension of time from the board to nominate directors because he was going on holiday and needed more time to finish his presentation.\par \par \uc2 The battle then grew even more testy as each side complained to the \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  about the information that had been disclosed during the battle.\par \par \uc2 Mr Ackman\u8217\'20\'19s proposals had received the full support of the independent proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, but rival proxy adviser ISS recommended that ADP shareholders vote for Mr Ackman but not his other two nominees, \uc2 Veronica Hagen\uc2  and \uc2 Paul Unruh\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That led Mr Ackman to write to \uc2 ISS\uc2 , alleging that ADP had disclosed non-public information to the adviser in order to curry favour. Both \uc2 ISS\uc2  and ADP denied the allegations.\par \par \uc2 The battle came at a time when Pershing Square had been struggling. After returning 36.9 per cent in 2014, it was down 16.2 per cent in 2015 and finished last year down 9.6 per cent.\par \par \uc2 In March this year, Mr Ackman apologised to investors over his disastrous backing of drugmaker Valeant, which lost about $4bn. The fund is flat this year.\par \par \uc2 During the proxy fight, Mr Ackman argued that ADP could boost its profit margins by improving software and services, reducing operating costs and offices, and becoming more efficient.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Rodriguez said Mr Ackman did not fully understand the company. Pershing Square holds an 8 per cent interest in ADP, with about 2 per cent in shares and the rest in derivatives. The fund has invested about 25 per cent of its money in ADP, making the company its largest investment.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171107edb7006mx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Now some financial institutions try to attract customers by making saving money feel like entering the lottery.\par \par \uc2 When Texans head to the polls Tuesday, they will be asked to approve or disapprove a proposition to allow financial institutions to conduct raffles to promote saving. The Texas Constitution bans lotteries, with some exceptions, including the Texas Lottery.\par \par \uc2 Proposition 7 would authorize the Texas Legislature to carve out an exception for such products offered by financial institutions. If the measure passes, Texas will join more than a dozen states that allow banks and credit unions to offer chances to win cash prizes to customers who open new accounts and keep adding money to them.\par \par \uc2 Major Texas dailies, including the Dallas Morning News and the San Antonio Express-News, recommend that voters approve the proposition. "We view this as a useful tool to encourage people to save money and a more fruitful avenue than using, for instance, payday loans for emergency funds," wrote the editorial board of the Express-News.\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers from both parties earlier this year overwhelmingly approved putting the amendment to a vote.\par \par \uc2 The idea is that customers of banks and credit unions would get one entry into a raffle for every $25 they deposit into a savings account. The more money they save, the more chances they have to win a prize, until a certain limit.\par \par \uc2 Such products began to take off after the American Savings Promotion Act, a federal statute, was implemented in 2015 to approve the use of "savings promotion raffle." Experts believe raffles incentivize people with limited means to save more.\par \par \uc2 Larger banks offer cash incentives of $100 to $500 to customers who open checking and savings accounts. They generally target wealthier customers by setting their minimum deposit amounts high.\par \par \uc2 Already, credit unions from over a dozen states including Washington, New York and Indiana participate in a program called Save to Win. Customers gain one entry into a drawing for each $25 they deposit for chances to win prizes ranging from $25 to $5,000. The program started in Michigan in 2009, as several credit unions there tried to get people to save even at the height of the financial crisis, when many households were facing financial difficulties.\par \par \uc2 The Texas proposition specifies that the raffle prizes can't be exorbitant, no additional fees can be charged for entry, and interest must be paid on the savings. The institution can require the money to be kept in the savings account for a specified period to qualify for prizes.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Fed's Dudley Warns Against Overly Aggressive Regulation Rollback\par \par \uc2 By Michael S. Derby\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley cautioned elected leaders Monday not to go too far in rolling back financial sector regulations that were put in place to shore up the banking sector after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley was speaking before the Economic Club of New York, on the same day his bank announced his intention to retire in the middle of next year, ahead of the end of his term in January 2019. The official's unexpectedly accelerated retirement plans arrived amid a shake-up in Fed leadership that saw Vice chairman Stanley Fischer leave the bank last month, and a new Fed chair named last week to lead the central bank next year.\par \par \uc2 In his remarks Monday, Mr. Dudley joined with other officials who have said that while there is some scope to tinker with some of the postcrisis regulatory changes, too much of an overhaul may put the U.S. economy again at risk of another financial crisis. Similarly, Fed governor Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump's nominee to succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chair in February, has largely endorsed the Fed's efforts to strengthen regulations following the financial crisis to make the banking system safer while being open to reconsidering and adjusting them.\par \par \uc2 "We should not lose sight of the horrific damage caused by the financial crisis, including the worst recession of our lifetimes and millions of people losing their jobs and homes," Mr. Dudley said.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the still unfinished business of reform should be completed as quickly as possible, he said, adding, "we should do no harm as we adjust our regulatory regime to make it more efficient."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley, who also serves as a voting member of the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee, had limited comments on the state of the national economy and monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 He said the weakness of inflation in an economy "close" to full employment remains a bit of a "puzzle." But he added he still expects price pressures to move higher over time and that the traditional relationship between a strong job market and rising price pressures hasn't been entirely upended.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley didn't offer any comments about whether the Fed should raise rates soon but he added low price gains wouldn't necessarily cause the Fed not to act, given how long it takes changes in monetary policy to affect the economy. Most observers believe the Fed will boost its overnight target rate range\u8212\'20\'14currently at 1% to 1.25%\u8212\'20\'14at its December policy meeting.\par \par \uc2 "As the Federal Reserve moves forward, whether we tighten monetary policy in December or not," the central bank's 2% price rise target isn't a ceiling, he said. "Even if we were to decide on a rate hike in December with inflation below our 2% objective, we still have that objective, and we'll probably need to go a little above 2% to keep expectations well anchored," he said.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to regulatory changes, Mr. Dudley said alterations of existing laws and regulations should be done with a "paring knife, rather than with a meat cleaver." Maintaining higher capital and liquidity requirements for too-big-to-fail banks remains critical, he said.\par \par \uc2 Central clearing for derivatives securities should also be retained, and a continuing role for the Fed as an important regulator remains critical. Mr. Dudley also wants the \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2  to keep its ability to name nonfinancial firms as systemically important and eligible for increased government oversight.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Dudley also noted, "there are some areas where the pendulum may have swung too far, where the costs of regulation\u8212\'20\'14including compliance costs and the potential impact on the provision of services\u8212\'20\'14are likely to exceed the benefits."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley said smaller banking firms should get some regulator relief. Also, the Volcker rule, which limits certain types of trading for banks, should get a "less burdensome" implementation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley believes there has been a lot of progress in shoring up the financial system, but he is worried about the Fed's limited ability to lend on an emergency basis. It is also still unresolved how a failing international firm would be resolved. Mr. Dudley said there are still issues with how U.S. regulators can use their tools to blunt brewing trouble.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. "has limited ability to implement effective macroprudential tools," Mr. Dudley said.\par \par \uc2 "Oversight is shared by several different entities, and the power to implement macroprudential tools is constrained," he said.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Tricky Balancing Act Faces \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  Search Committee\par \par \uc2 By Nick Timiraos\par \par \uc2 Help Wanted: A senior executive with a keen knowledge of markets and economics, but who isn't too close to Wall Street because he or she will be responsible for regulating some of the world's biggest banks.\par \par \uc2 This is the balancing act facing a newly formed search committee for the next president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York following the announcement Monday that the current leader, William Dudley, will step down in mid-2018, several months before his term expires in January 2019.\par \par \uc2 The New York Fed president is a voting member of the Federal Reserve committee that sets interest rates and other monetary policies aimed at keeping the economy on track. The chief also runs the Fed bank that works with the markets to implement these policies and which supervises some of the nation's biggest financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 The new president would take over an institution more intensely scrutinized since the financial crisis, and criticized by some lawmakers and others as a lax supervisor before the turmoil and too slow to get tough afterward.\par \par \uc2 The search for Mr. Dudley's successor adds to an extraordinary degree of churn in the central bank's top ranks. President Donald Trump last week nominated Fed governor Jerome Powell to succeed Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen when her term expires next February. Last month, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer stepped down from his post. Mr. Trump has three open seats to fill on the board and could have a fourth if Ms. Yellen decides to leave after her term as chairwoman ends.\par \par \uc2 Already, the Senate has confirmed Mr. Trump's first board nominee, Randal Quarles, to the position of vice chair of bank supervision. If Ms. Yellen departs, every governor except for Lael Brainard would be in their current job courtesy of Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 There is no example in modern Fed history of a new chair, vice chair and New York Fed president taking office within just a few months, said Peter Conti-Brown, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 "We're embarking on an unprecedented change of the guard within the Federal Reserve System," he said.\par \par \uc2 The closest example, he said, comes from the early 1950s, when William McChesney Martin Jr. launched a campaign to consolidate leadership in Washington, filling a vacant vice chair position and driving out New York Fed President Allan Sproul, but even that process took four years to complete.\par \par \uc2 "We're in uncharted territory," said Mr. Conti-Brown.\par \par \uc2 Because Mr. Powell, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first Fed chairman in 30 years without a Ph.D. in economics, the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  search committee could put a premium on a candidate with expertise in monetary policy. The search team might also focus on candidates with management experience, since the New York Fed president manages an institution of more than 3,100 employees, and with experience dealing with international markets and foreign central banks.\par \par \uc2 Candidates that might fit at least some of these criteria would include \uc2 Simon Potter\uc2 , head of the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2 's markets group; his deputy, Lorie Logan; and \uc2 Brian Sack\uc2 , an economist at hedge fund \uc2 D.E. Shaw Group\uc2  who held the job before Mr. Potter.\par \par \uc2 Other candidates who could receive consideration, according to analysts and other Fed watchers, include Ms. Brainard; former Fed governors \uc2 Kevin Warsh\uc2  and Jeremy Stein; Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs; Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS; Jason Cummins, chief economist at hedge fund Brevan Howard and chairman of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee; Richard Clarida, an economist at Pacific Management Investment Co., or Pimco; Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School; Antonio Weiss, a former Treasury Department counselor; \uc2 David McCormick\uc2 , former Treasury undersecretary for international affairs; and Nathan Sheets, also a former Treasury undersecretary.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump won't have a hand in selecting Mr. Dudley's successor. While the seven Fed board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the 12 regional bank presidents are selected by the nonbank directors of each reserve bank, subject to approval by the Fed's Washington-based governors.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  said it has formed a four-person committee of business and civic leaders to run the nationwide search. The co-chairs are \uc2 Sarah Horowitz\uc2 , a union organizer who founded the Freelancers Union, a nonprofit that provides health care and other benefits to independent workers, and private-equity investor \uc2 Glenn Hutchins\uc2 , who was an adviser to Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential transition team.\par \par \uc2 The search committee also includes \uc2 David Cote\uc2 , chairman of Honeywell who served as the firm's chief executive until March, and Denise Scott, a top executive at the Local Initiatives Support Corp., a nonprofit that specializes in community development.\par \par \uc2 Two other board members who will vote on the committee's recommendations are Emily Rafferty, former president of the \uc2 Metropolitan Museum of Art\uc2 , and \uc2 Terry Lundgren\uc2 , chairman of Macy's Inc. who served as the retailer's chief executive until March.\par \par \uc2 Before he ran the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2 's markets desk in 2007, Mr. Dudley was chief economist at Goldman Sachs, and concerns that Goldman has too much sway within the system has been amplified by the selections in recent years of other Goldman alums to run the Minneapolis and \uc2 Dallas Fed\uc2  banks. (A fourth Fed bank, Philadelphia, is led by an academic who had been a Goldman trustee.)\par \par \uc2 The choice of the New York Fed president "will be the second most important nomination within the Federal Reserve system after Powell's nomination for chair last week," said Michael Gapen, Chief U.S. economist at Barclays.\par \par \uc2 First Director of Office of Financial Research to Leave Post\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy and Nick Timiraos\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The head of the U.S. Office of Financial Research plans to leave by year's end, adding to uncertainty for a young agency that faces proposed budget cuts and an inspector general's probe into management and personnel issues.\par \par \uc2 Richard Berner has been the only director of the OFR, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law to help fix problems with financial data and to spot potential risks to the economy. It is an arm of the Treasury Department, but has independent funding and a director confirmed to a six-year term, features designed to insulate the department from political maneuvering.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Berner, whose term expires in 2019, announced his decision at a staff meeting Monday flanked by two Treasury Department officials, including Craig Phillips, a counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 "After six years of commuting between Washington, D.C., and my home in New York, I have decided that it is time for me to go home to my wife and enjoy time with our grandchildren," Mr. Berner said in a written statement. "It has been a great privilege to serve the American people and work alongside such dedicated civil servants at the OFR."\par \par \uc2 The OFR declined a request for additional comment from Mr. Berner.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mnuchin thanked Mr. Berner for his service in a written statement on Monday, calling him "instrumental" in launching the office.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Berner, an economist who once led a research team at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , previously served as a counselor to former Treasury Secretary \uc2 Timothy Geithner\uc2  in 2011 and was confirmed as the office's director in January 2013. He oversaw the growth of the agency to a staff of more than 200 and an annual budget of about $100 million.\par \par \uc2 Under his watch, the agency has produced some well-regarded research papers, helped create a new international data standard for identifying financial firms, provided financial data to regulators on the \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2  and created tools to monitor opaque parts of the financial system such as money-market funds.\par \par \uc2 Its critics say it could be doing more to improve the way the U.S. monitors the financial system. Unlike another Dodd-Frank creation, the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 , the OFR hasn't aggressively asserted its independence.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Berner has never used two potentially powerful statutory authorities: collecting and standardizing financial data. The OFR's backers blamed messy and incomplete data for making the 2008 financial crisis harder to manage.\par \par \uc2 The office has been a target of congressional Republicans since its creation, with lawmakers seeking to disband it. President Donald Trump's administration has kept up that pressure and proposed in June that Congress move the agency fully inside the Treasury, essentially undoing the political buffers that Congress instituted in the 2010 law.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Berner is departing at a moment of internal turmoil at the OFR. In recent years, it has struggled with persistently low morale as tracked by federal employee surveys, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Berner has brought in consultants to analyze the problem, these people said.\par \par \uc2 Morale took another hit in May when the Treasury, in its annual budget proposal, suggested slashing the OFR's workforce by about 38%. Under Dodd-Frank, the OFR director has final say over the agency's budget but must consult with the Treasury.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Phillips, at Monday's staff meeting, said the administration believes the agency needs to be right-sized, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Treasury's Office of Inspector General is "doing both audit and investigative work related to management and personnel issues at OFR," a representative of that office said Monday, declining to provide additional details.\par \par \uc2 At Bridgewater, a Secret Settlement and a Groping Claim Against \uc2 Ray Dalio\uc2 's Prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9\par \par \uc2 By Rob Copeland\par \par \uc2 WESTPORT, Conn.\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Bridgewater Associates\uc2  paid a settlement to a woman who was pushed out after engaging in a consensual relationship with top executive Greg Jensen, and shortly after heard from another female employee that Mr. Jensen had groped her buttocks, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jensen, 43 years old, was directly mentored by Bridgewater founder \uc2 Ray Dalio\uc2 , 68, and groomed over two decades to succeed him as leader of the world's largest hedge fund. At the time both incidents were brought to the company's attention roughly three years ago, he was co-chief executive of the firm. He is now Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer, helping oversee around $160 billion in assets and hundreds of employees.\par \par \uc2 The billionaire Mr. Dalio was personally involved in mediating both matters, people familiar with them said. Both women have since left Bridgewater and are barred by nondisclosure agreements from discussing their experiences publicly, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dalio approved a settlement of more than $1 million for the woman who had a relationship with Mr. Jensen, the people said.\par \par \uc2 The woman who complained of being groped didn't leave Bridgewater because of the incident, and wasn't pushed out, the people said. She met with Mr. Dalio and continued her career elsewhere, they said. No lawyers were involved.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jensen said in a statement: "The Wall Street Journal's accusations of my behavior are inaccurate and salacious. They are hurtful to my family and my reputation with those who don't know me, so I am deeply disappointed with their sense of responsibility."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dalio declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Neither incident has been previously reported.\par \par \uc2 A Bridgewater spokesman said in a statement: "While we are prohibited from speaking to this case, our track record speaks for itself. Because of the people, procedures and culture we have in place, Bridgewater, over the course of its 43-year history, has had very few incidents, handled them thoughtfully, comprehensively and fairly, and has had no material adverse judgements."\par \par \uc2 Westport, Conn.-based Bridgewater is the world's largest and most successful hedge-fund firm, having produced investment gains of $49 billion for clients since 1975, more than any rival, according to LCH Investments NV, a hedge-fund investor.\par \par \uc2 Bridgewater is known for its culture of "radical transparency," which requires most meetings to be recorded and openly ranks employees on their weaknesses. Mr. Dalio has stated that his self-written "Principles," a list of rules for life and work, constitute a meritocratic management system he hopes to export to other companies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jensen joined Bridgewater as an intern in 1996 after graduating from \uc2 Dartmouth College\uc2 , where he was the president of his fraternity. He later signed a lifetime noncompetition agreement with Bridgewater, people familiar with the matter said. He was inducted into what Bridgewater calls its "circle of trust," a group of roughly one dozen staffers allowed full knowledge of the firm's investment process, the people said. Mr. Jensen is married with three children.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jensen also serves on Bridgewater's management and stakeholders committees, the latter of which Mr. Dalio has described in an investor letter as equivalent to the firm's board of directors.\par \par \uc2 Between 2011 and 2016, Mr. Jensen earned $1.7 billion in compensation, according to estimates from researcher Institutional Investor's Alpha. He pledged to invest a majority of his wealth into Bridgewater shares, including buying some of Mr. Dalio's stake in the firm as the founder retreats from day-to-day management, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Several current and former male and female Bridgewater employees said they were at times uncomfortable with Mr. Jensen's behavior outside of the office and at company events.\par \par \uc2 At an official off-site company celebration in 2011, Mr. Jensen hired a stripper with a feathered boa to surprise Mr. Dalio on the dais in front of an estimated 1,000 guests, according to people present. They said the move appeared to reference a longstanding rumor, since confirmed by Mr. Dalio in his recently published autobiography, that Mr. Dalio was fired from an early job in part because he brought a stripper to a convention lecture.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jensen has frequently hosted after-hours celebrations at his Connecticut home. Former employees said they referred to his pool house as the "party barn." In one instance, Mr. Jensen challenged each employee at a company party attended by hundreds to take a shot of alcohol with him.\par \par \uc2 Several current and former female employees whom Bridgewater suggested the Journal contact complimented Mr. Jensen.\par \par \uc2 "There are really more women than I can count\u8212\'20\'14myself included\u8212\'20\'14who would say Greg has been nothing but an inspiring mentor and deeply invested in their development." said Karen Karniol-Tambour, a top deputy to Mr. Jensen.\par \par \uc2 Bridgewater co-chief executive Eileen Murray said in a statement: "I have seen firsthand how hard he has worked to create a professional and inclusive environment."\par \par \uc2 At one official company event, Mr. Jensen began a monthslong personal relationship with a female employee who was his junior and in his line of supervision, people familiar with the matter said. During the relationship, he offered the employee encouragement and personal help to further her career at Bridgewater, these people said.\par \par \uc2 After others at Bridgewater discovered the relationship between the two, Mr. Dalio was alerted, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dalio questioned Mr. Jensen and the woman together in front of a panel of top Bridgewater executives, people familiar said. Bridgewater's human-resources department wasn't immediately involved, the people said.\par \par \uc2 At one point, Mr. Dalio assigned James Comey, Bridgewater's then-general counsel, to question employees about Mr. Jensen's conduct with subordinates, including his interactions with the female employee, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Comey would later become director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He couldn't be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 Later, Mr. Dalio told some at Bridgewater that he couldn't determine whether Mr. Jensen or the female employee were telling the truth about the relationship, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Dalio noted that Mr. Jensen's overall believability had long been ranked particularly highly in Bridgewater's rating metrics, meaning that his description of some details of the relationship carried extra credibility over hers, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 As the investigation continued, Bridgewater put the female employee on a leave of absence, while Mr. Jensen remained at his post, these people said. At about the same time, the employee hired the well-known discrimination attorney Gloria Allred, who spoke with Mr. Dalio for several hours, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dalio and Ms. Allred, who declined to comment, negotiated a settlement of more than $1 million, the people said. The exact terms of the settlement couldn't be determined. After agreeing to the settlement, the employee was escorted out from her desk, they said.\par \par \uc2 CFTC Fines Cargill $10 Million Over Swaps Trades\par \par \uc2 By Gabriel T. Rubin\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  fined \uc2 Cargill Inc\uc2 . $10 million for improperly valuing swap trades, a move that the regulator said caused the company's revenue to appear higher than it should have been.\par \par \uc2 The Minnesota-based agribusiness company misled both its trade counterparties and the data repositories where all swap dealers must report their trades, the agency said. The violations date back to 2013, when Cargill first registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC, and the company has "failed to develop systems or procedures to prevent inaccurate communications" since then, the agency said in its order.\par \par \uc2 Cargill, which didn't admit or deny wrongdoing, said it would be "immediately implementing revised customer reporting, as well as enhancing its internal controls and employee training programs."\par \par \uc2 Swaps are derivatives contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based on fluctuations in certain benchmarks. Companies use these contracts to hedge risks or make bets in such areas as fuel prices or interest rates. The CFTC has had jurisdiction over swaps trading since the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and most of its rules have been in place since 2013 when Cargill first registered as a swaps dealer.\par \par \uc2 The CFTC said that Cargill, rather than reporting the true value of its swaps to the data repositories and its counterparties, instead used a "mid-market mark," or interim price, which allowed it to maximize its trading revenue. The correct valuation of the trades would have reduced Cargill's revenue, the CFTC said. The inaccurate information affected thousands of complex swaps since 2013.\par \par \uc2 "The Commission will vigorously pursue those who undermine the fairness and integrity of our markets, as Cargill did by providing marks that concealed its full mark-up on the swaps at issue in this case," CFTC Director of Enforcement James McDonald said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The Cargill fine is steep for the CFTC. The amount might be higher than usual due to what the CFTC called Cargill's repeated failure to correct its business practices and align them with CFTC rules. The agency alleges that the company failed to properly supervise its swap business employees and that "Cargill took no steps to bring its marks into compliance" despite the fact that "employees were aware" that the valuations were inaccurate.\par \par \uc2 Men Linked to 1MDB Financier Failed in Bid to Buy Bank\par \par \uc2 By Bradley Hope, Simon Clark and \uc2 Tom Wright\par \par \uc2 Two men with links to the alleged mastermind of a multibillion-dollar Malaysian financial scandal launched a bid last year to buy a controlling stake in a bank in Mauritius.\par \par \uc2 The deal took shape in the months after the \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  alleged in a July 2016 civil asset-forfeiture lawsuit that Jho Low, a Malaysian financier, helped divert billions of dollars from state investment fund \uc2 1Malaysia Development Bhd\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14and at times used small banks to help launder the money. Mr. Low has denied wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 In late 2016, former \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . partner \uc2 Tim Leissner\uc2 , who had been the primary Goldman executive to handle the bank's 1MDB account, and Thai businessman Phengphian Laogumnerd, a friend of Mr. Low's, worked together in an effort to buy Qatari-owned Century Banking Corp. of Mauritius.\par \par \uc2 The central bank of the Indian Ocean island nation blocked the transaction and, concerned about a possible connection between Mr. Leissner and the global 1MDB scandal, notified the \uc2 U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  about the bid, according to people briefed on the central bank's actions. Mr. Leissner, who is German, had been Goldman's Southeast Asia chairman before it suspended him for writing an unauthorized letter of recommendation for Mr. Low.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Leissner handled 1MDB for the Wall Street bank from the fund's creation in 2009, helping raise billions of dollars of bonds for the fund, and he worked with Mr. Low from the time that Mr. Low was an adviser to a fund that eventually became 1MDB, according to people familiar with their relationship.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department is investigating the nature of Mr. Leissner's relationship with Mr. Low, according to people familiar with the probe. Mr. Leissner has said he had only a passing acquaintance with Mr. Low and that work he did while at Goldman on the 1MDB account was above board.\par \par \uc2 Goldman has consistently said it did nothing wrong and had no way of knowing there might be fraud connected to 1MDB. Neither Goldman nor Mr. Leissner have been accused of wrongdoing in relationship to 1MDB.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Phengphian also has a business connection with Mr. Low: In July 2017, he acquired from a Low family trust a controlling stake in a lingerie business in London.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Low has said he would fight civil cases filed by the Justice Department against assets it says were purchased with stolen 1MDB funds. Those cases were recently put on hold by a judge after the Justice Department requested more time to finish criminal investigations into the alleged 1MDB fraud and related asset purchases.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Mr. Low declined to comment on the Century Banking deal. A lawyer for Mr. Leissner said his client did nothing illegal in the deal.\par \par \uc2 1MDB has denied any funds were misappropriated or any wrongdoing on its part, and pledged to cooperate with any "lawful" investigation. Malaysian authorities cleared the fund of wrongdoing, though it remains under investigation in the U.S. and several other countries.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Low has said he was only an informal adviser to 1MDB. U.S. investigators say he was pulling strings from behind the scenes, arranging deals to divert funds.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department said in its asset-forfeiture cases that Mr. Low and alleged co-conspirators at times laundered money through small financial institutions that they thought would attract little attention.\par \par \uc2 The Department alleges that one such institution, \uc2 Falcon Private Bank Ltd\uc2 . of Switzerland, was controlled by an associate of Mr. Low's from the Middle East and used to move laundered 1MDB funds. Falcon was fined by regulators in Switzerland and Singapore for lack of proper money-laundering controls and remains the subject of a Swiss criminal investigation, according to Swiss authorities. Falcon has said it is initiating new control measures and that it has been cooperating with authorities.\par \par \uc2 The Mauritius bank, Century Banking, is owned by Ghanim Bin Saad Al Saad Group of Qatar. It opened in 2011 and is located along the waterfront in the capital, Port Louis. Mr. Low's family trust previously bought a high-end building in London from the group in 2014. The Justice Department is trying to seize it, according to an asset-forfeiture lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Months after Mr. Leissner quit \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , following his suspension, in March 2016, Mr. Phengphian worked with him to help complete a purchase of Century Banking, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Phengphian, a manager of Songkhla Finishing Co., a technology contracting company in Thailand, would fund the deal, the people said. Lawyers for Mr. Phengphian declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 The corporate registry in Mauritius shows Mr. Leissner set up a company called Blackfish International (Mauritius) Ltd. on Sept. 29, 2016.\par \par \uc2 On Nov. 11, Mr. Phengphian became a member of the Century board, and on Dec. 29 he transferred about \u8364\'20\'AC10 million ($11.6 million) from an account in Hong Kong to his Century Banking account, according to people with direct knowledge of the transfers.\par \par \uc2 The money was converted into Mauritian rupees and passed through two companies before ending up in the Century Banking account of Blackfish, which converted it to dollars and transferred about $7.7 million to a Mauritius law firm hired by Mr. Phengphian to help purchase the bank, these people said. A lawyer at the firm is a director of Blackfish along with Mr. Leissner, records show.\par \par \uc2 After that transaction\u8212\'20\'14in late December 2016 or early this year\u8212\'20\'14Mr. Leissner applied to Mauritius authorities to acquire a controlling stake in Century Banking and become an executive and board member, according to Mr. Leissner's lawyer, Marc Harris, and Century Banking chief executive Muniruddeen Lallmahamood.\par \par \uc2 The Bank of Mauritius\uc2 , the nation's central bank, soon launched an investigation into the transaction after it learned that Mr. Leissner was associated with 1MDB and Mr. Low, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The central bank later rejected Mr. Leissner's application for "compliance concerns," said Mr. Harris, the lawyer. Mr. Harris didn't identify those concerns.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lallmahamood declined to comment on Mr. Leissner's application, except to say it wasn't approved by the central bank.\par \par \uc2 In response to questions to \uc2 the Bank of Mauritius\uc2  about the Century Banking bid, Yandraduth Googoolye, first deputy governor of the central bank, said: "You may rest assured that the Bank is exercising its regulatory duties in terms of its statutory powers."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Leissner did become a director of a fully owned subsidiary of the bank for several months, ending in April, corporate registry records show\u8212\'20\'14a move that was approved by a different regulator. In September, the German banker was barred from the U.S. securities industry for failing to cooperate with a regulator's investigation related to his departure from Goldman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Phengphian is now chairman of Century Banking's board, appointed to the position in January after what the bank's CEO, Mr. Lallmahamood, described as thorough due diligence in line with global best practices.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: House Poised to Reauthorize Flood-Insurance Program\par \par \uc2 House Republicans are preparing to bring to the floor as early as this week legislation to reauthorize the federal flood-insurance program for five years. The move comes after the bill's author, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), eased aspects of the bill that would have imposed steep penalties on individuals whose homes have repeatedly flooded. The concessions, which make it harder for repeat flood victims to lose their insurance coverage, was part of a deal reached between Mr. Hensarling and House Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), who had previously opposed the legislation. The bill is expected to clear the House on Wednesday or Thursday, largely along party lines, though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where efforts to reauthorize the program have languished.\par \par \uc2 Equifax Board Continues to Probe Legal Officer's Share-Sales Role\par \par \uc2 By AnnaMaria Andriotis\par \par \uc2 An \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . board committee is continuing to examine the role of the company's chief legal officer in approving share sales by four executives days after suspicious activity was discovered in the company's systems, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 That inquiry remains open even though the committee, comprised of independent directors, on Friday issued a report exonerating the executives who sold stock. Three of the four executives sold around $1.8 million of company shares combined.\par \par \uc2 The share sales were called into question after \uc2 Equifax\uc2  in early September disclosed that it was the subject of a massive data breach that exposed vital personal information of potentially 145.5 million Americans.\par \par \uc2 The board committee said the executives who sold stock, including finance chief \uc2 John Gamble\uc2 , didn't have knowledge of the suspicious activity. It added that "none of the four executives engaged in insider trading."\par \par \uc2 But the report didn't address the level of knowledge \uc2 John J. Kelley\uc2 , Equifax's chief legal officer, had about the suspicious activity when his office approved the share sales. In addition to his legal duties, Mr. Kelley was also in charge of security at \uc2 Equifax\uc2  and the company's former chief security officer reported to him. That executive, Susan Mauldin, retired after the breach disclosure.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kelley is no longer overseeing security, according to people familiar with the matter. The change occurred after the breach disclosure, they added.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Neither Mr. Kelley nor Ms. Mauldin could be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  became aware of the suspicious activity on its systems on July 29. Mr. Kelley was made aware of this on July 30, according to the people familiar with the matter. On July 31, Mr. Kelley emailed \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2 , the company's CEO at the time, to tell him then-Chief Information Officer \uc2 David Webb\uc2  would likely be sharing some news pertaining to suspicious activity, according to another person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith has said in written testimony that he learned of the suspicious activity on July 31 in a conversation with Mr. Webb. Both Messrs. Smith and Webb retired after the breach was disclosed.\par \par \uc2 The board committee is continuing to review the level of information Mr. Kelley had at that time, the people added. The executives, after receiving approval from Mr. Kelley's office, sold their shares on Aug. 1 and Aug. 2.\par \par \uc2 The board committee report did say it examined the role of the company's legal department in the share sales and concluded authorization given to the executives to trade was "within the authority permitted under [company] policy." Its report said that neither \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's "chief legal officer nor his designated preclearance officer had reason to believe" that the four executives knew about the security incident when they submitted their preclearance requests or on the date of their trades.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kelley himself, though, was aware of the suspicious activity on \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's systems when his office approved the trades, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Suspicious activity at a company like \uc2 Equifax\uc2  isn't rare given that it is a target of hackers. By itself, such a report might not be reason to prevent executives from trading. At \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , like many other companies, executives have a specific window in which to trade.\par \par \uc2 That window opened on July 28, two days after the company released its earnings report, and was scheduled to run through Aug. 31. On Aug 15, the legal department imposed a "trading blackout" on staff aware of the hack.\par \par \uc2 An exchange during a congressional hearing into the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  breach, though, suggested that Mr. Kelley had been notified early on about the incident and was made aware that consumers' personal information could have been compromised.\par \par \uc2 Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.) said at one hearing that she was informed by her staff that Ms. Mauldin told Mr. Kelley the week of July 30th that the cybersecurity incident "might have compromised personally identifiable information."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mauldin told congressional staffers that she shared the possibility of personal information being compromised because of results from a sampling of data that staff had done in the wake of the July 29 discovery of a possible intrusion, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\par \par \uc2 The suspicious activity occurred in a place in the company's system that holds consumer information, specifically a portal where information on consumer credit reports is disputed. The suspicious activity \uc2 Equifax\uc2  staff spotted involved a small number of documents that consumers had submitted through the dispute portal, which could have included images of bills or checks that were moving around in an unusual manner, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Within days, on Aug. 2, \uc2 Equifax\uc2  had contacted the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  about the security incident and brought in \uc2 Mandiant\uc2 , the cyber-investigations unit of \uc2 FireEye Inc\uc2 ., to investigate.\par \par \uc2 10 Things to Know About Jerome Powell\par \par \uc2 By David Harrison and Nick Timiraos\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump nominated Jerome Powell last week to serve as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Powell, 64 years old, has served on the central bank's board of governors for the past five years. Below are a few factoids about his life:\par \par \uc2 1. Many people in government move to Washington, D.C., for work. Not Mr. Powell. He grew up in suburban Chevy Chase, Md., where he still lives and both his parents grew up there too.\par \par \uc2 2. Mr. Powell graduated from Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit high school, where he played football. His father had been class valedictorian and his brother, three uncles and three cousins also graduated from the school. His 1971 class included Rep. Francis Rooney (R., Fla.) who was U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. Other notable alums include Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R., N.J.), and former Sen. Chris Dodd (D., Conn.).\par \par \uc2 3. Mr. Powell wrote his college thesis at \uc2 Princeton University\uc2  on the prospects for political change in South Africa, which at the time was living under apartheid.\par \par \uc2 4. After graduating from Princeton in 1975 and before attending law school, Mr. Powell worked for four months as a warehouse assistant at M.S. Ginn's, an office-supply store, in Bladensburg, Md.\par \par \uc2 5. As a partner at investment firm the \uc2 Carlyle Group LP\uc2 , Mr. Powell logged service on the boards of directors of beverage company Dr Pepper/Seven Up and Rexnord LLC, an industrial-products maker.\par \par \uc2 6. Mr. Powell has served on the board of several Washington-area nonprofits including the local chapter of \uc2 the Nature Conservancy\uc2  and several education groups.\par \par \uc2 7. About 20 years ago, at the request of the late James Cardinal Hickey, then the Catholic archbishop of Washington, D.C., Mr. Powell chaired a group that raised $30 million to help several struggling Catholic schools stay open.\par \par \uc2 8. Mr. Powell is an avid cyclist who used to ride his bike from his home in Chevy Chase to the downtown Washington headquarters of the Fed. He also has played guitar in rock 'n' roll bands.\par \par \uc2 9. Mr. Powell's wife, Elissa Leonard, is a television and film producer and a local elected official in Chevy Chase.\par \par \uc2 10. President Barack Obama first nominated Mr. Powell, a Republican, to the Fed's board of governors in 2012.

Now some financial institutions try to attract customers by making saving money feel like entering the lottery.\par \par \uc2 When Texans head to the polls Tuesday, they will be asked to approve or disapprove a proposition to allow financial institutions to conduct raffles to promote saving. The Texas Constitution bans lotteries, with some exceptions, including the Texas Lottery.\par \par \uc2 Proposition 7 would authorize the Texas Legislature to carve out an exception for such products offered by financial institutions. If the measure passes, Texas will join more than a dozen states that allow banks and credit unions to offer chances to win cash prizes to customers who open new accounts and keep adding money to them.\par \par \uc2 Major Texas dailies, including the Dallas Morning News and the San Antonio Express-News, recommend that voters approve the proposition. "We view this as a useful tool to encourage people to save money and a more fruitful avenue than using, for instance, payday loans for emergency funds," {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/article/Prop-7-useful-tool-to-encourage-savings-12321289.php"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 wrote the editorial board of the Express-News}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 State lawmakers from both parties earlier this year overwhelmingly approved putting the amendment to a vote.\par \par \uc2 The idea is that customers of banks and credit unions would get one entry into a raffle for every $25 they deposit into a savings account. The more money they save, the more chances they have to win a prize, until a certain limit.\par \par \uc2 Such products began to take off after the American Savings Promotion Act, a federal statute, was implemented in 2015 to approve the use of "savings promotion raffle." Experts believe raffles incentivize people with limited means to save more.\par \par \uc2 Larger banks offer cash incentives of $100 to $500 to customers who open checking and savings accounts. They generally target wealthier customers by setting their minimum deposit amounts high.\par \par \uc2 Already, credit unions from over a dozen states including Washington, New York and Indiana participate in a program called {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.savetowin.org/product-info/faqs"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Save to Win}}}\uc2 . Customers gain one entry into a drawing for each $25 they deposit for chances to win prizes ranging from $25 to $5,000. The program started in Michigan in 2009, as several credit unions there tried to get people to save even at the height of the financial crisis, when many households were facing financial difficulties.\par \par \uc2 The Texas proposition specifies that the raffle prizes can't be exorbitant, no additional fees can be charged for entry, and interest must be paid on the savings. The institution can require the money to be kept in the savings account for a specified period to qualify for prizes.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Fed's Dudley Warns Against Overly Aggressive Regulation Rollback\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-dudley-warns-against-overly-aggressive-regulation-roll-back-1509988682"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York}}}\uc2  President William Dudley cautioned elected leaders Monday not to go too far in rolling back financial sector regulations that were put in place to shore up the banking sector after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley was speaking before the Economic Club of New York, on the same day his bank announced his intention to retire in the middle of next year, ahead of the end of his term in January 2019. The official's unexpectedly accelerated retirement plans arrived amid a shake-up in Fed leadership that saw Vice chairman Stanley Fischer leave the bank last month, and a new Fed chair named last week to lead the central bank next year.\par \par \uc2 In his remarks Monday, Mr. Dudley joined with other officials who have said that while there is some scope to tinker with some of the postcrisis regulatory changes, too much of an overhaul may put the U.S. economy again at risk of another financial crisis. Similarly, Fed governor Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump's nominee to succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chair in February, has largely endorsed the Fed's efforts to strengthen regulations following the financial crisis to make the banking system safer while being open to reconsidering and adjusting them.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-audience-q-a-with-federal-reserves-william-dudley-1510009318"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 WSJ Pro Transcript: Audience Q&A With Federal Reserve's William Dudley}}}\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Tricky Balancing Act Faces \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  Search Committee\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tricky-balancing-act-faces-new-york-fed-search-committee-1510050602"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Help Wanted: A senior executive}}}\uc2  with a keen knowledge of markets and economics, but who isn't too close to Wall Street because he or she will be responsible for regulating some of the world's biggest banks.\par \par \uc2 This is the balancing act facing a newly formed search committee for the next president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York following the announcement Monday that the current leader, William Dudley, will step down in mid-2018, several months before his term expires in January 2019.\par \par \uc2 First Director of Office of Financial Research to Leave Post\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-treasurys-first-director-of-office-of-financial-research-to-leave-post-1509987633"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The head of the U.S. Office of Financial Research}}}\uc2  plans to leave by year's end, adding to uncertainty for a young agency that faces proposed budget cuts and an inspector general's probe into management and personnel issues.\par \par \uc2 Richard Berner has been the only director of the OFR, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law to help fix problems with financial data and to spot potential risks to the economy. It is an arm of the Treasury Department, but has independent funding and a director confirmed to a six-year term, features designed to insulate the department from political maneuvering.\par \par \uc2 At Bridgewater, a Secret Settlement and a Groping Claim Against \uc2 Ray Dalio\uc2 's Prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bridgewater-paid-over-1-million-to-employee-pushed-out-after-relationship-with-dalios-right-hand-man-1510050781"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bridgewater Associates paid a settlement}}}\uc2  to a woman who was pushed out after engaging in a consensual relationship with top executive Greg Jensen, and shortly after heard from another female employee that Mr. Jensen had groped her buttocks, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jensen, 43 years old, was directly mentored by Bridgewater founder \uc2 Ray Dalio\uc2 , 68, and groomed over two decades to succeed him as leader of the world's largest hedge fund. At the time both incidents were brought to the company's attention roughly three years ago, he was co-chief executive of the firm. He is now Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer, helping oversee around $160 billion in assets and hundreds of employees.\par \par \uc2 The billionaire Mr. Dalio was personally involved in mediating both matters, people familiar with them said. Both women have since left Bridgewater and are barred by nondisclosure agreements from discussing their experiences publicly, the people said. Mr. Dalio approved a settlement of more than $1 million for the woman who had a relationship with Mr. Jensen, the people said.\par \par \uc2 CFTC Fines Cargill $10 Million Over Swaps Trades\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-fines-cargill-10-million-over-swaps-trades-1509998830"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission}}}\uc2  fined \uc2 Cargill Inc\uc2 . $10 million for improperly valuing swap trades, a move that the regulator said caused the company's revenue to appear higher than it should have been.\par \par \uc2 The Minnesota-based agribusiness company misled both its trade counterparties and the data repositories where all swap dealers must report their trades, the agency said. The violations date back to 2013, when Cargill first registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC, and the company has "failed to develop systems or procedures to prevent inaccurate communications" since then, the agency said in its order.\par \par \uc2 Men Linked to 1MDB Financier Failed in Bid to Buy Bank\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/men-linked-to-1mdb-financier-failed-in-bid-to-buy-bank-1510050600"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Two men with links to the alleged mastermind}}}\uc2  of a multibillion-dollar Malaysian financial scandal launched a bid last year to buy a controlling stake in a bank in Mauritius\u8212\'20\'14prompting an investigation by regulators.\par \par \uc2 The deal took shape in the months after the \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  alleged in a July 2016 civil asset-forfeiture lawsuit that Jho Low, a Malaysian financier, helped divert billions of dollars from state investment fund \uc2 1Malaysia Development Bhd\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14and at times used small banks to help launder the money.

The move comes after the bill's author, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), eased aspects of the bill that would have imposed steep penalties on individuals whose homes have repeatedly flooded. The concessions, which make it harder for repeat flood victims to lose their insurance coverage, was part of a deal reached between Mr. Hensarling and House Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), who had previously opposed the legislation. The bill is expected to clear the House on Wednesday or Thursday, largely along party lines, though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where efforts to reauthorize the program have languished.\par \par \uc2 Equifax Board Continues to Probe Legal Officer's Share-Sales Role\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-board-continues-to-probe-legal-officers-share-sales-role-1509991844"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 An Equifax Inc. board committee}}}\uc2  is continuing to examine the role of the company's chief legal officer in approving share sales by four executives days after suspicious activity was discovered in the company's systems, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 That inquiry remains open even though the committee, comprised of independent directors, on Friday issued a report exonerating the executives who sold stock.

That\u8217\'20\'19s why we have asked \uc2 Mark McCombe\uc2  to take an expanded leadership role,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Fink and Mr Kapito said.\par \par \uc2 The Americas division that Mr McCombe leads accounts for two-thirds of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s assets under management and revenues. More than 40 per cent of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s $5.9tn in client assets are managed from San Francisco, which accounts for a third of group revenue.\par \par \uc2 After Mr Kapito, Mr McCombe and \uc2 Mark Wiedman\uc2 , head of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s passive investment arm, are considered top contenders to succeed Mr Fink.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C\uc2 BlackRock\uc2  understands that technology is what will drive the business in the next five to 10 years. Wiedman and McCombe are tech savvy and the next generation of leaders,\u8221\'20\'1D said an executive at a rival asset management group who knows both men.\par \par \uc2 Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create-Research, a consultancy, said \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s greater focus on San Francisco will help \u8220\'20\'1Cseal its claim as a technology-driven company that intends to retain its pole position in the global asset industry\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 As head of Americas, Mr McCombe is responsible for Canada, Latin America/Iberia, US wealth advisory, and US and Canada defined contribution businesses. As well as many of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s largest clients, including \uc2 Calpers\uc2  and \uc2 Calstrs\uc2 , the pension funds, Mr McCombe is also involved in \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s exchange traded fund and institutional client businesses.\par \par \uc2 Roughly half of the team that manages \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s lucrative iShares business, the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest ETF provider, is located in San Francisco, where it was founded. New York-based Mr Wiedman has oversight of iShares.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CiShares is driving the fast growth and is the most important part of the business,\u8221\'20\'1D the executive said. \u8220\'20\'1C[Mr McCombe] has driven the regional businesses in Asia-Pacific [from 2012 to 2016] and now the Americas.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 San Francisco is also home to \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s systematic active equity (SAE) investment team, the quantitative investment group headed by \uc2 Jeff Shen\uc2  and Raffaele Savi. That business is led by \uc2 Mark Wiseman\uc2 , head of equities who is also among the contenders to succeed Mr Fink along with \uc2 Rob Goldstein\uc2 , the chief operating officer who heads \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s technology push.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSystematic active equity is the future. It combines the best of actives and passives and may well emerge as the third way of investing,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr Rajan. \u8220\'20\'1CPension investors perceive it as a device for getting alpha at beta risk and beta charges.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWith the advances in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , it will be a game changer by the end of this decade, as asset managers achieve an optimal machine-human interface to generate investible information and actionable insights.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s systematic active equity and systematic fixed income businesses \u8212\'20\'14 previously known as scientific active equity and model-based fixed income \u8212\'20\'14 have grown assets under management to more than $150bn.\par \par \uc2 The company said the term \u8220\'20\'1Csystematic\u8221\'20\'1D reflected the evolution of quantitative management since the financial crisis a decade ago. \u8220\'20\'1CThe new quant utilises unstructured data, \b \highlight22\uc2 natural\b0 \highlight\uc2 -\b \highlight22\uc2 language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , among other techniques, to generate alpha and does so alongside more traditional quantitative approaches,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  said, adding it planned to \u8220\'20\'1Cexpand these solutions to both institutional and retail clients globally\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  acquired San Francisco-based FutureAdvisor, a robo-adviser crafting automated portfolios for investors, in a deal underscoring how technology is reshaping the market for financial advice.\par \par \uc2 FutureAdvisor, founded by two former \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  engineers, is one of a new generation of tech companies offering asset allocation advice to people who cannot afford \u8212\'20\'14 or do not feel comfortable visiting \u8212\'20\'14 a traditional broker.\par \par \uc2 Its products are sold to brokers and financial advisers, who in turn offer them to their clients.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171106edb6000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Would you let a thinking robot pick stocks for you?\par \par \uc2 Fund companies are increasingly turning to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to help inform their investment-management decisions. Using AI to manage investments is nothing new for institutional investors\u8212\'20\'14some of the world's most high-profile hedge funds including Renaissance Technologies and Bridgewater Associates rely on computers' analysis to make day-to-day trading decisions. But AI-powered investing is making its way to individual investors, as well.\par \par \uc2 In October, two new high-profile products using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  were launched\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 AI Powered Equity ETF\uc2  (AIEQ) and the Credit Suisse RavenPack \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial Intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  Sentiment (AIS) Index.\par \par \uc2 AIEQ is the first ETF powered by \uc2 International Business Machines Corp\uc2 .'s Watson cognitive computing platform and is managed by San Francisco-based EquBot, an investment company with plans to launch several AI-powered ETFs in the future.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse AG\uc2  joined with New York-based \uc2 RavenPack\uc2  on its AI-powered index product. The investment bank says \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will be used to make sector-weighting decisions in the index, which tracks the performance of U.S. large-cap stocks. The AIS index is the first AI product for \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A machine's insight\par \par \uc2 Both AIEQ and AIS work on the same principle\u8212\'20\'14they rely on machines to analyze reams of analyst notes, articles, earnings-call transcripts, regulatory filings and social-media posts on individual companies to gather insights about how they might perform. From there, the software determines the weighting of their respective indexes and trades.\par \par \uc2 Art Amador, co-founder and chief operating officer at EquBot, says that EquBot's algorithms with the power of Watson will look for undervalued stocks to invest in that have the potential to outperform over time. A human will monitor the decisions to ensure data quality.\par \par \uc2 AIEQ represents an evolution in the investment process and landscape. Mr. Amador says his company chose to use Watson because the platform works well with investments.\par \par \uc2 "All AI is not created equal," he says. "We wanted to be able to offer transparency into what stocks were being chosen and why they were being chosen. The EquBot approach to using AI for investing is designed to provide that understanding."\par \par \uc2 Watson is already being used in financial services and banking for regulatory compliance and financial data analysis. AIEQ is the first ETF powered by Watson.\par \par \uc2 Mutual-fund managers are also bringing \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  into the investment process.\par \par \uc2 In October, \uc2 AXA Investment Management\uc2 's Rosenberg Equities announced it was taking steps to integrate AI into its investment products. Fund managers at Rosenberg Equities, which already uses algorithms to run its funds, also plan to use \b \highlight22\uc2 natural\b0 \highlight\uc2 -\b \highlight22\uc2 language\b0 \highlight\uc2 -\b \highlight22\uc2 processing\b0 \highlight\uc2  technology to analyze things like analyst notes, articles and other unstructured data that could have an impact on how stocks perform. Rosenberg says \b \highlight22\uc2 natural\b0 \highlight\uc2 -\b \highlight22\uc2 language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2  will inform its smart beta and "core plus" strategies, which are designed to beat the performance of benchmark indexes, largely through stock weightings.\par \par \uc2 According to Michael Kollo, head of research and chief quantitative strategist for Rosenberg Equities at \uc2 AXA\uc2  IM, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  will also be folded into investment modeling to help fund algorithms predict risk and extreme price movements in specific stocks.\par \par \uc2 "We already have a significant computing infrastructure in place, so it makes sense for us to take this step and continue to improve our process," Dr. Kollo says.\par \par \uc2 The bond bots\par \par \uc2 AI is also creeping into fixed-income funds. New York-based Wavelength Capital Management's Wavelength Interest Rate Neutral Fund (WAVLX) has been using a proprietary \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  system to analyze information and make trading decisions about the bond market since 2013. WAVLX is designed to capture positive return from the bond market without being sensitive to interest rates.\par \par \uc2 "When we started, there wasn't a lot of data available," says Mark Landis, co-founder at Wavelength. "We were training our software using articles, historical patterns, social-media posts\u8212\'20\'14a lot of unstructured data. As regulation increased reporting requirements for all asset classes, we've been able to add that information into our \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  platform. The insights are getting better each year."\par \par \uc2 WAVLX is up 4.56% year-to-date through Oct. 27. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the benchmark index for the bond market, was up 2.90% for the same period.\par \par \uc2 People power\par \par \uc2 Is it all over for humans?\par \par \uc2 Not quite. With all of these products, even though computers are taking on the role of a hyper-dialed-in portfolio manager, there are still humans standing by, ready to flip the switch if the software gets carried away.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Kollo, the head of research at Rosenberg Equities, cautions that investors should use that same kind of vigilance when choosing AI-powered funds.\par \par \uc2 "The technology itself is only a tool, like a shovel or a hammer," Dr. Kollo says. "Success still depends on the skill of the manager running the strategy," he says. "Investors still need to understand the team, what the process is and what the goals are before they invest."\par \par \uc2 Ms. McCann is a writer in New York.

That's why we have asked Mark McCombeto take an expanded leadership role,"Mr Fink and Mr Kapito said.\par \par \uc2 The Americas division that Mr McCombe leads accounts for twothirds of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's assets under management and revenues. More than 40 per cent of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's $5.9tn in client assets are managed from San Francisco, which accounts for a third of grouprevenue.\par \par \uc2 After Mr Kapito, Mr McCombe and \uc2 Mark Wiedman\uc2 , head of Black-Rock's passive investment arm, are considered top contenders to succeed Mr Fink .\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 BlackRock\uc2  understands that technology is what will drive the business in the next five to 10 years. Wiedman and McCombe are tech savvy and the next generation of leaders," said an executive at a rival asset Management group who knowsbothmen.\par \par \uc2 Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create-Research., a consultancy, said \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's greater focus on San Francisco will help "seal its claim as a technology-driven company that intends to retain its pole position in the global asset industry".\par \par \uc2 Mr McCombe is responsible for Canada, Latin America/Iberia, US wealth advisory, and US and Canada defined contribution businesses. As well as many of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's largest clients, including \uc2 Calpers\uc2  and \uc2 Calstrs\uc2 , the pension funds, Mr McCombe is also involved in Black-Rock's exchange traded fund and institutional client businesses .\par \par \uc2 continued on page2 continued from page 1 Roughly half of the team that manages \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's lucrative iShares business, the world's largest ETF provider, is located in San Francisco, where it was founded. New York-based Mr Wiedman has oversight of iShares.\par \par \uc2 "iShares is driving the fast growth and is the most important part of the business," the executive said. "[Mr McCombe] has driven the regional businesses in Asia-Pacific [from 2012 to 2016] and now the Americas."\par \par \uc2 San Francisco is also home to \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's systematic active equity (SAE) investment team, the quantitative investment group headed by \uc2 Jeff Shen\uc2  and Raffaele Savi. That business is led by \uc2 Mark Wiseman\uc2 , head of equities who is also among the contenders to succeed Mr Fink along with \uc2 Rob Goldstein\uc2 , the chief operating officer who heads \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's technology push.\par \par \uc2 "Systematic active equity is the future. It combines the best of actives and passives and may well emerge as the third way of investing," said Mr Rajan. "Pension investors perceive it as a device for getting alpha at beta risk and beta charges.\par \par \uc2 "With the advances in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , it will be a game changer by the end of this decade, as asset managers achieve an optimal machinehuman interface to generate investible information and actionable insights."\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's systematic active equity and systematic fixed income businesses have grown assets under management to more than $150bn.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171106edb60003i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Broadcom was formed when Avago Technologies Ltd. bought the former Broadcom in 2015 for $37 billion and kept the name. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the purchase price was $39 billion. (Nov. 7, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Broadcom Ltd\uc2 . made an unsolicited $105 billion takeover bid for \uc2 Qualcomm Inc\uc2 ., the chip industry's boldest bet yet that size will equal strength at a time of technological upheaval.\par \par \uc2 The approach, which would mark the biggest technology takeover ever, shows how tech companies are positioning themselves for a world where a range of chip-driven devices\u8212\'20\'14from phones to cars to factory robots\u8212\'20\'14are transmitting, receiving and processing evermore information.\par \par \uc2 Broadcom Chief Executive \uc2 Hock Tan\uc2  already has used acquisitions to build the company into the fourth-biggest chip maker by market value, part of a wave of industry consolidation as profits on some chips, such as those used in personal computers, are squeezed by sluggish sales and rising costs.\par \par \uc2 A combination with \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  would create a behemoth whose chips manage communications among consumer devices and appliances, phone service providers, and data centers that are becoming the workhorses in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The deal is far from certain. San Diego-based \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 , which said it would consider the proposal, is expected ultimately to rebuff it on the grounds that the price isn't high enough, especially given the significant risk that regulators would block it, according to some analysts. Under typical circumstances, unfriendly bids like this are difficult to pull off; given the sheer size and complexity of \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 , this one could be especially challenging, analysts said Monday.\par \par \uc2 Broadcom\uc2 's preference is to strike a friendly deal, but if it fails to do so, it would consider nominating \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  directors who may be more amenable to a transaction, a person familiar with the matter said. The nomination deadline is Dec. 8 and the annual meeting at which the director vote would take place is likely be around March.\par \par \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  offered $70 a share for \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 , representing a 28% premium from its closing price on Thursday\u8212\'20\'14before news reports on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/broadcom-plans-unsolicited-bid-for-qualcomm-1509733193"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the expected approach}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  shares ended trading Monday up 1.2% to $62.52, while \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  shares were 1.4% higher at $277.52.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tan said he has been talking with \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  for over a year about a possible tie-up. "Our strategy has been consistent," Mr. Tan said in an interview. "When a business is No. 1 in technology and No. 1 in market position, we acquire it and put it on our \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  platform and grow through that strategy. \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  has a very large sustainable franchise that meets those criteria."\par \par \uc2 Should the deal be completed, \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  would take on \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 's leadership in developing the next wave of cellular technology, known as 5G, which is expected to roll out over the coming two years. That could give \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  a new growth engine, as 5G is expected to dramatically accelerate the speed and responsiveness of cellular communications necessary for applications like self-driving cars.\par \par \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  was formed when \uc2 Avago Technologies Ltd\uc2 . bought the former \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  in 2015 for $37 billion and kept the name, and Mr. Tan has continued growing by acquisition. The company sells a diverse line of equipment for networking and communications. Its products include chips for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology that connect devices that are closer together\u8212\'20\'14technologies that some analysts say are likely to grow less quickly than 5G.\par \par \uc2 "People will continue to use short-proximity wireless like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but the growth and money is clearly in 5G," said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.\par \par \uc2 Overall, \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  and \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  have largely complementary product lines. But the possible \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  takeover is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny, given the companies' combined scale and the fact that they are both leaders in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology. The companies share customers including \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 ., whose iPhones and iPads include components from both \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  and \uc2 Broadcom\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  already has been under pressure from antitrust agencies in several jurisdictions, including the U.S. The company has paid hefty regulatory fines in China, South Korea and Taiwan.\par \par \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  was riding high as recently as a year ago after unveiling the chip industry's largest-ever acquisition: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qualcomm-to-buy-nxp-semiconductors-1477565063"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a $39 billion proposed deal}}}\uc2  for \uc2 NXP Semiconductors NV\uc2 . The deal hasn't closed yet, and \uc2 Broadcom\uc2  said Monday that its proposal would stand regardless of whether \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 's proposed acquisition of NXP is consummated under the current terms.\par \par \uc2 Since then, a string of hits by regulators, competitors and customers including Apple has left the industry titan in a vulnerable position. \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2 's profit in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 24 plummeted 57%, and its share price declined 18% in the 12 months through Thursday's close compared with a 58% rise in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index. That was before news of \uc2 Broadcom\uc2 's interest sent \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  shares up nearly 13% on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Funding for the deal would come in the form of loans from a gaggle of banks, with additional cash from \uc2 Silver Lake Management LLC\uc2 . The private-equity firm, which already owns a stake in \uc2 Broadcom\uc2 , provided a commitment letter for $5 billion in convertible debt. Silver Lake said a substantial portion of that capital would come in the form of an equity investment from its \uc2 Silver Lake Partners\uc2  fund, with the remainder from other sources.\par \par \uc2 The equity contribution would be the single largest in the history of the firm, exceeding the roughly $1 billion it invested in the merger of \uc2 Dell Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 EMC Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Broadcom\uc2 's bid came days after the Singapore-based company announced plans to relocate its headquarters to the U.S., a move that could make it easier to pursue acquisitions of U.S. targets.\par \par \uc2 Broadcom\uc2 's earlier $5.5 billion offer to buy Brocade Communication Systems, based in San Jose, Calif., has been delayed due to a review by the \uc2 Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\uc2 , which reviews international deals that raise concerns about national security.\par \par \uc2 Any deal to acquire \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  would also receive close scrutiny, experts say. "Anything that has the word semiconductor in it gets rapt attention from \uc2 CFIUS\uc2 ," said James Lewis of the \uc2 Center for Strategic and International Studies\uc2 , a policy think tank. "The move to the U.S. is an effort to tamp down \uc2 CFIUS\uc2  concerns."\par \par \uc2 Dana Cimilluca contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ted Greenwald at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Read More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/broadcoms-very-risk-bet-on-qualcomm-1509998689?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heard on the Street: Broadcom's Very Risky Bet on Qualcomm}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivals-intel-and-amd-team-up-on-pc-chips-to-battle-nvidia-1509966064"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Intel, AMD Team on Chips to Battle Nvidia}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/broadcom-plans-unsolicited-bid-for-qualcomm-1509733193"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Broadcom Plans Unsolicited Bid for Qualcomm}}}\uc2  (Nov. 3)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/11/03/qualcomm-soars-on-report-that-broadcom-plans-takeover/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Qualcomm Soars on Report That Broadcom Plans Takeover}}}\uc2  (Nov. 3)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/11/02/broadcom-sinks-after-announcing-move-to-u-s/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Broadcom Sinks After Announcing Move to U.S.}}}\uc2  (Nov. 2)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171106edb60025t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The collapse of the Sprint/T-Mobile deal talks suggests that is slipping from his grasp.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jacky Wong \par \uc2 437 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 November 2017\par 14:07\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The size of the SoftBank Vision Fund is $93 billion. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said it was a $98 billion fund. (Nov. 6, 2017)\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2 , control is all important. The question right now is whether too much is slipping from the SoftBank chief executive's grasp.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son spent much of SoftBank's latest earnings call Monday explaining why its 83%-owned U.S. telecom operator Sprint has abandoned merger talks with \uc2 T-Mobile\uc2 . When U.S. regulators opposed a previous attempt at the deal in 2014, Mr. Son complained he had lost hair as a result.\par \par \uc2 This time around, Mr. Son pronounced himself happy {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-inside-story-of-how-the-sprint-and-t-mobile-deal-collapsed-again-1509838624"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 at the deal's demise}}}\uc2 , arguing it was more important for SoftBank to retain control of the company: A deal with the larger \uc2 T-Mobile\uc2  now would likely see \uc2 Sprint\uc2  as the junior partner. Instead, SoftBank is actually raising its stake in \uc2 Sprint\uc2  further, to 85%.\par \par \uc2 The decision, however, means \uc2 Sprint\uc2  will have to carry on fighting alone against its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-t-mobile-sprint-merger-would-have-changed-the-u-s-market-1509829023"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 three bigger rivals in the U.S.}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14including \uc2 T-Mobile\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14while having to stretch its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-ought-to-back-a-sprint-and-t-mobile-marriage-1509425094"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 already indebted balance sheet}}}\uc2  to fund billions of dollars of new investment in next-generation networks.\par \par \uc2 Sprint\uc2  isn't the only problem for Mr. Son. The $93 billion {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-worlds-largest-tech-fund-can-set-softbank-stock-free-1489056061"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SoftBank Vision Fund}}}\uc2  that SoftBank launched in May along with the Saudi Arabian government reported decent results, with an operating profit of $1.6 billion so far. Yet much of that came from only one investment\u8212\'20\'14the fund's 4.9% stake in chip designer Nvidia. Shares in the company, which designs graphic chips used in \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , have doubled this year.\par \par \uc2 The past weekend's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crackdown-doesnt-guarantee-aramco-ipo-or-higher-oil-1509953962"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 turmoil within the Saudi royal family}}}\uc2  may not have too much bearing on the Vision Fund. What does seem strange is that one of the world's biggest technology fund's latest deals is to buy a significant minority stake in \uc2 Saudi Electricity Company\uc2 . It's also planning to build the world's biggest solar power plant in a new city in Saudi Arabia called {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/10/26/urban-myth-or-hot-ipo-candidate/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Neom, which doesn't yet exist}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But how are such investments consistent with SoftBank's aim of leading the "information revolution?" Mr. Son's answer: Saudi Arabia "has great sunshine" and that "without electricity, you can't use phones." That's a practical enough response, but hardly one that burnishes his credentials as a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-vision-fund-will-keep-tech-unicorns-happy-1490700816"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tech-investing visionary}}}\uc2 . Mr. Son will need to do more to stop any suspicion growing that he has bitten off more than he can chew.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jacky Wong at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:JACKY.WONG@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 JACKY.WONG@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171106edb600209\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Still, the shares are up 28% this year.\par \par \uc2 After the market close, SoftBank reported an 81% drop in quarterly earnings, a result it attributed to losses on hedging transactions that it expects to be reversed later.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son had approached \uc2 T-Mobile US\uc2 's parent, \uc2 Deutsche Telekom AG\uc2 , about a merger between the two carriers even before SoftBank took control of \uc2 Sprint\uc2  for $22 billion in 2013. Since then, he has argued repeatedly that only by consolidating would \uc2 Sprint\uc2  have the scale to challenge bigger rivals \uc2 Verizon Communications Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At a news conference Monday in Tokyo, Mr. Son said he had sought a way to retain control of the merged entity. When it became clear that was impossible, he said he urged his board to drop the deal, since he viewed \uc2 Sprint\uc2  as a critical player for the time when a vastly increased number of devices would be communicating over a network.\par \par \uc2 "Things may be tough for three to four years," Mr. Son said. But "\uc2 Sprint\uc2  will become critical for SoftBank as a group in five years' to 10 years' time."\par \par \uc2 He said, without giving details, that he was still looking for potential partners for \uc2 Sprint\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son, known for successful bets on China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 , has been stepping up deal-making in areas where he sees radical change coming, such as robotics, \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and auto technologies. In May, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-saudis-to-launch-100-billion-tech-fund-1495270854"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SoftBank launched the world's biggest tech investment fund, the $93 billion Vision Fund}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It has poured money into companies like office-sharing firm WeWork Cos., robotics startup Boston Dynamics and Indian e-commerce company Flipkart Group, and it is pursuing a multibillion-dollar investment in ride-hailing company \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 . Although most of SoftBank's revenue still comes from \uc2 Sprint\uc2  and a mobile-phone provider in Japan, Mr. Son said his focus is on deal-making.\par \par \uc2 "I've never thought SoftBank's main business was telecommunications\u8212\'20\'14not for one day, not for one second," he said, adding that the company will invest "in the majority of the world's unicorns"\u8212\'20\'14that is, startups valued at more than $1 billion.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son reaffirmed that SoftBank is negotiating for a stake in Uber but said he wouldn't go forward if the terms aren't right. "It's still very possible for us to shift our investment target to Lyft," he said, referring to Uber's main U.S. rival.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 's results for the July-September quarter, released Monday, underscored the impact of the investment push. The company booked an accounting loss of \u165\'00\'A5247.6 billion ($2.2 billion) connected to derivatives transactions it entered into last year, when it started to sell Alibaba shares to raise money to buy U.K. chip-design company \uc2 ARM Holdings PLC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The derivatives limit SoftBank's gains and losses from the share sale. But they also require the company to book a temporary paper loss if Alibaba shares rise, as they have. Mr. Son said the losses would be completely reversed in 2019 when the derivatives are unwound.\par \par \uc2 Operating profit rose 20% to \u165\'00\'A5395.6 billion thanks to the Vision Fund's investment in chip maker \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 , whose shares have appreciated. Without the Vision Fund, which includes investments from a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund and tech giants such as \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 ., operating profit would have fallen 4%, SoftBank said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Mayumi Negishi at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:mayumi.negishi@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mayumi.negishi@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Phred Dvorak at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:phred.dvorak@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 phred.dvorak@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171106edb600001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It was a rare move for China's credit-rating industry, which tends to give much more bullish assessments than global counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Of the 41 banks that Dagong assessed, only Baoshang's outlook was negative, according to database Wind Information Co. The others were all marked "stable." Baoshang couldn't be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 While Dagong maintained its AA+ rating on Baoshang's credit, the negative adjustment to its outlook shows that risks are still growing in some corners of China's banking sector despite government moves to rein them in. Beijing's efforts could also create further financial risks should authorities not give lenders enough time to adjust.\par \par \uc2 Chinese regulators this year have made it more expensive for banks to borrow from each other and have been scrutinizing loans and investments that banks don't properly account for on their balance sheets. These moves are benefiting China's large state-owned banks but hurting smaller lenders, which don't have vast retail deposit franchises and can't compete with state-owned banks when it comes to winning over state-owned borrowers. Smaller banks' growth has pulled back as they adjust to the new regulatory measures.\par \par \uc2 As of the third quarter, Baoshang had 153 billion yuan ($23 billion) in "investment receivables," a loosely regulated category of assets that allows bank officials to set aside little or nothing for potential losses. The category made up more than a quarter of its total assets, and is comparable to Baoshang's 208 billion yuan in total loans. Borrowing from other financial institutions made up more than one-third of the bank's total liabilities, a threshold set by regulators.\par \par \uc2 Though Baoshang is privately owned, its fate rests largely on what authorities do.\par \par \uc2 Dagong warned that Baoshang's capital adequacy level had fallen below regulatory standards and that the bank's nonperforming loans were extremely high. But it didn't downgrade the lender, saying its liquidity was "generally at a high level" and that the bank could get support from the government. Baosheng, with some 200 billion yuan in deposit money, could still have a sizable share in a local market, according to analysts.\par \par \uc2 "The government wants to deleverage but it doesn't want to hurt financial system stability," says Yulia Wan, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. She said this is one reason Chinese banks are unlikely to see a wave of downgrades by local rating firms.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 New York Fed President Dudley to Announce Early Retirement\par \par \uc2 By Michael S. Derby and Nick Timiraos\par \par \uc2 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is set to announce he will retire next year, about six months earlier than scheduled, adding to an unusual wave of turnover among the central bank's top monetary and regulatory decision makers and ushering in new uncertainty about its policy course.\par \par \uc2 William Dudley's announcement could come as soon as Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter. The search for his successor will start immediately with the aim of finding a successor in mid-2018.\par \par \uc2 The decision has been long-planned and is unrelated to President Donald Trump's announcement Thursday that he would nominate central-bank governor Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen when her term as chairwoman expires in February, according to a person familiar with the situation.\par \par \uc2 Just last month, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer stepped down and Randal Quarles, Mr. Trump's first nominee to the Fed's Washington-based board of governors, took office. Three other seats on the seven-member board are also open, giving the president an opportunity to remake its policy-making team.\par \par \uc2 A fourth seat on the board would open if Ms. Yellen decides to leave after ceding the helm as chairwoman. She could stay on as a governor in a term that extends to 2024.\par \par \uc2 All governors are nominated by the U.S. president and are subject to Senate confirmation. The regional Fed bank presidents are chosen by the members of their boards of directors who don't represent financial institutions regulated by the Fed, subject to approval by the governors.\par \par \uc2 The New York Fed president is traditionally one of the central bank's most powerful policy makers. This person serves as vice chairman of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee and leads the supervision of some of the nation's biggest financial firms.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley, a former Goldman Sachs chief economist, started at the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  in 2007, running the part of the institution that deals directly with financial markets to implement monetary policy. Many of his predecessors had markets experience.\par \par \uc2 If that tradition continues, contenders for the job include \uc2 Simon Potter\uc2 , who now runs the bank's markets desk, as well as D.E. Shaw's \uc2 Brian Sack\uc2 , who held that job before Mr. Potter.\par \par \uc2 Some observers close to the bank see a chance that its next president could be a current Fed official. \uc2 Dallas Fed\uc2  leader \uc2 Robert Kaplan\uc2 , a former \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  top executive, has deep market experience, as does Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who also worked at Goldman and led some of the government's financial-crisis rescue efforts.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen, Mr. Fischer and Mr. Dudley worked closely together in recent years in deciding when and how to begin gradually reversing the Fed's crisis-era stimulus policies as the economy healed.\par \par \uc2 The trio advocated keeping short-term interest rates historically low to encourage hiring and growth, but also has nudged them gently higher since late 2015 to prevent the economy from overheating. They also crafted and launched the Fed's plan to shrink its large portfolio of bonds purchased since the crisis to provide extra stimulus.\par \par \uc2 The Fed has penciled in one more interest rate increase this year, and more through 2020 if the economy performs as expected. The coming changes in the top three leadership positions, combined with the recent pickup in economic momentum, raise uncertainty about the coming pace of rate increases.\par \par \uc2 The three officials also supported postcrisis measures to strengthen financial regulation and will be giving up their top posts just as the Trump administration is pushing for deregulation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley's planned departure marks "further change in an institution that was already experiencing considerable change," said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. There has been a big question of "do we have enough intellectual firepower" at the Fed given all the recent leadership churn, he said.\par \par \uc2 The coming announcement about Mr. Dudley, 64 years old, was earlier reported by CNBC. The \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley was long among the Fed "doves" who supported holding interest rates near zero for seven years after the crisis to help steady the markets and support the economy. But he also strongly supported nudging rates higher over the past two years to help keep the expansion on an even keel, even though inflation has run below the Fed's 2% target in recent months.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley has said the Fed should continue gradually lifting borrowing costs to keep price pressures contained and prevent dangerous asset bubbles from forming.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley has favored rate increases "in part because he gives more weight to the risk of financial overheating than to the need to get the inflation numbers right down to the last decimal place," said Louis Crandall, chief economist with Wrightson ICAP.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley also was central in implementing multiple bond-buying campaigns, expanding the Fed's portfolio dramatically after 2009. He has since been a leading advocate for the slow, passive run-off of those holdings, which began last month with scarcely any impact on financial markets.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  has devised new methods of managing the Fed's benchmark rate in an environment in which it maintains much larger liabilities. Mr. Dudley has been an outspoken advocate for maintaining a larger terminal balance sheet, an issue that hasn't yet been formally settled by the central bank.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen and Mr. Dudley started the process of lifting rates and reducing the Fed's balance sheet "with no snafus, and that was not a trivial task," said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College professor and former Fed board staffer. "President Dudley deserves some of the credit" for what the central bank has done right, he said.\par \par \uc2 It hasn't always been smooth sailing. Under Mr. Dudley, the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  faced repeated criticisms that it was too close to the private banks it supervises and failed to spot problems ahead of the crisis. After the crisis, the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2 , once the most feared banking regulator on Wall Street, lost power to the Washington-based board.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dudley drew such heavy criticism from lawmakers in late 2014 that Ms. Yellen publicly defended him, saying that he had "done a fine job in running the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  and I want to be very clear that I have great confidence in him."\par \par \uc2 Several regional Fed banks that have seen their presidents exit in recent years have often found it to be a long process to replace their presidents. The \uc2 Richmond Fed\uc2  hasn't yet named a successor to former president Jeffrey Lacker, who resigned in April.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Levin said he hopes the process to pick Mr. Dudley's successor will be more open to the public than similar searches in the past. "It can't be done purely behind closed doors and in back rooms. It should be done in a public way," providing some sense of who is being considered for the job, he said.\par \par \uc2 Wilbur Ross Didn't Disclose Business Ties to Putin Inner Circle\par \par \uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus\par \par \uc2 Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross failed to disclose business connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin's family and inner circle on a required personal financial-disclosure form earlier this year, according to documents released over the weekend.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ross said earlier this year that he would retain stakes owned by his private-equity firm in a gas-shipping company, \uc2 Navigator Holdings Ltd\uc2 . He didn't disclose that the company does millions of dollars in business\u8212\'20\'14$68 million since 2014\u8212\'20\'14with a Moscow petrochemicals company, Sibur, with close ties to the Kremlin, according to analysis by the \uc2 International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Those ties were revealed this weekend in a trove of internal documents from Appleby, a Bermuda law firm that has handled more than 60 offshore holdings for Mr. Ross's company. Those documents were leaked to a German newspaper and then shared with the journalism consortium, a global network of media outlets.\par \par \uc2 Sibur's owners include Kirill Shamalov, who is married to Mr. Putin's younger daughter, and Gennady Timchenko, a co-founder of the Gunvor Group, a Cyprus-registered commodities trading firm. Mr. Timchenko was among the first Russian businessmen to be sanctioned by the U.S. following Russia's intervention in Ukraine's Crimea region. The \uc2 Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control\uc2  called him a member of "the Russian leadership's inner circle" and said Mr. Timchenko's "activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin."\par \par \uc2 Sibur's largest shareholder, Leonid Mikhelson, runs Novatek, Russia's largest private natural-gas company, which also has been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for its ties to Mr. Putin. Mr. Timchenko owns 23% of the company.\par \par \uc2 Both Gunvor and Mr. Timchenko have denied any financial connections to the Russian president. Novatek has sought to distance itself from Mr. Timchenko, saying the oligarch has limited influence on the company, and it has criticized the U.S. sanctions.\par \par \uc2 The Commerce Department released a statement Sunday saying Mr. Ross hadn't been involved in \uc2 Navigator Holdings\uc2 ' decision to do business with Sibur and "has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship."\par \par \uc2 The statement said Mr. Ross "recuses himself from matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels but has been supportive of the administration's sanctions against Russian and other entities." Mr. Ross "works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards," the statement said.\par \par \uc2 As commerce secretary, Mr. Ross oversees agencies with wide powers over trade and the U.S.'s economic relationship with foreign countries. His stake in a company with ties to Russian firms that are the subject of U.S. sanctions could come under particular scrutiny as the U.S. has escalated sanctions against Moscow in recent months. The disclosure also comes just after the first charges and plea agreement were announced last week by \uc2 Robert Mueller\uc2 , the special counsel investigating whether Trump associates worked with Russia as part of what the U.S. says was Moscow's interference in the 2016 election.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ross was an economic adviser and fundraiser for Donald Trump during the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia by him or his campaign, and Moscow has denied meddling in the election.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee, said in a tweet Sunday that he felt "misled" by Mr. Ross during the confirmation process.\par \par \uc2 "In concealing an ongoing financial relationship w/ Russian oligarchs, Sec. Ross misled me, Senate Commerce Committee & the American people," Mr. Blumenthal wrote. "Why do so many Trump associates have such trouble disclosing relationships with Russia?"\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ross, a private-equity billionaire, said earlier this year that he would sell at least 80 business assets and investment funds if confirmed by the Senate, but he would hold on to investments in \uc2 Navigator Holdings\uc2  and 10 other entities that invest in shipping and real-estate financing, according to federal financial-disclosure and ethics filings. Mr. Ross hasn't said why he has held on to those particular assets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ross's stake in \uc2 Navigator Holdings\uc2  is held through four Cayman Islands entities, according to ICIJ's review of the documents. In his disclosure form in January, Mr. Ross valued his stake in those entities as between at least $2.05 million and $10.1 million, according to a Journal analysis of the filing. Mr. Ross didn't disclose his stake in one of the four companies on the form and didn't say why.\par \par \uc2 Together, those four entities hold a 31.5% stake in \uc2 Navigator Holdings\uc2 , according to a Journal analysis of Navigator's most recent annual report. According to the company's Nov. 5 stock price, those shares are valued at $176 million.\par \par \uc2 In August, President Trump signed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2016 election, while calling the law "seriously flawed." Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the new U.S. sanctions as "a declaration of a full-fledged economic war on Russia," and promised consequences for U.S.-Russian relations.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, unsealed court documents in the Mueller probe showed a Trump campaign foreign-policy adviser admitted lying to \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents about his contacts with Russians during the campaign, while two campaign officials, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were charged with laundering millions of dollars in funds from overseas work unrelated to the Trump campaign.

The investors, which include fund managers \uc2 John Paulson\uc2  and \uc2 Bill Miller\uc2 , bought these warrants for bank stocks secondhand, after they were initially issued to the government during the 2008 bank bailout.\par \par \uc2 The investors' unpopular view at the time was that banks and their stock prices would recover to precrisis levels. By betting on warrants, a high-octane security similar to an option, the fund managers basically doubled down on that opinion, risking their entire investment if it didn't happen by 2018 or 2019.\par \par \uc2 "If the subprime credit-default swaps were this asymmetric, beautiful investment to express what was wrong with American capitalism\u8230\'20\'26, these securities are the opposite," said Django Davidson, a founding partner at London-based Hosking Partners LLP, which bought about $200 million of the warrants for banks including \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The warrants date back to the financial crisis, when the government invested about $250 billion in about 700 banks as a part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. As part of the program, which aimed to shore up bank capital and restart lending, the government got warrants to buy shares in the banks. The Treasury Department started getting rid of the warrants in 2009, a process that included selling some off to investors.\par \par \uc2 For years after the crisis, many investors hated bank stocks, comparing them to heavily regulated utilities no longer able to take risks and grow. The warrants also slumped; some of \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 .'s fell so much they were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2016.\par \par \uc2 But since last November's presidential election, bank stocks have helped lead a broad stock-market rally tied to renewed confidence and hopes of tax and regulatory overhaul. Meanwhile, banks' crisis-era legal problems have subsided and interest rates have started to rise, making lending more profitable.\par \par \uc2 The change in sentiment has made the warrants a turnaround story. Some from big banks have surged 65% to 1470% since the election, easily outpacing the 36% rally in the KBW Nasdaq Bank stock index. One group of \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 's warrants, once left for dead, are up the most in the group. With the recent jump, \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . warrants are up 429% since they started trading in late 2009, compared with a 148% increase for the bank's stock.\par \par \uc2 The warrants give investors the right to buy a stock at a predetermined price. If the stock rises far above that "strike price," the warrant is like a winning lottery ticket. If it stays below that price, the warrant ends up worthless.\par \par \uc2 While exchange-traded stock options usually go out only a couple of years, warrants often last longer. "We were lucky it was a 10-year warrant," said Philippe Jabre, a Geneva-based fund manager who bought warrants in \uc2 SunTrust Banks Inc\uc2 ., among others. He said the recovery took longer than he had expected.\par \par \uc2 "There were good days and other days when I felt like crying," said John Hadwen, a portfolio manager at \uc2 CI Investments\uc2 ' Signature Global Asset Management, which has held TARP warrants since 2010. When his \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  warrants fell in value after the bank's 2012 London whale trading loss, Mr. Hadwen pushed to buy the rest available, but the Canadian asset-manager's chief investment officer said no.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Davidson said he learned about the warrants a few years ago at an Omaha bar where he was mingling with attendees at \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway\uc2  's annual meeting. \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2 , the conglomerate's chairman, got warrants unrelated to TARP as a part of Berkshire's crisis-era investments in \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Miller Opportunity Trust mutual fund said it has notched gains of about $77 million on a $24 million investment in \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  warrants.\par \par \uc2 When the fund bought the warrants, "the market hated financials and was pricing in pretty dire scenarios," said Samantha McLemore, co-manager on the portfolio with Mr. Miller.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paulson, who made billions of dollars betting against subprime mortgages a decade ago, turned a roughly $100-million profit on about $600 million in bank warrant investments, according to a person familiar with the matter. But he could have earned more if his funds hadn't sold their \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  warrants in 2012. Mr. Miller's fund similarly lost out by selling \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  warrants around that time, though Ms. McLemore says the fund has done well by hanging onto the bank's common stock.\par \par \uc2 Investors got the warrants only because the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  didn't want to hold on to them. By late 2009, the biggest banks had paid TARP money back and the Treasury started auctioning the warrants. By the end of 2012, it had made about $5 billion auctioning them off to investors. In other cases, Treasury sold the warrants back to the banks.\par \par \uc2 That has transferred the rest of the gains to private hands. The TARP warrants still trading in \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 , \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 , \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 PNC Financial Services Group Inc\uc2 ., for example, are worth more than $2 billion more on paper than when the government sold. At banks such as \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  that hit their strike price a while ago, investors have likely netted additional profits by exercising the warrants.\par \par \uc2 New York-based Maltese Capital Management bought 2.2 million TARP warrants in Salt Lake City-based \uc2 Zions Bancorp\uc2  . from the government for about $1.35 apiece and held on to most of them. Today, they are worth about $11.30 per share, a return of around 740%. "We'd like a few more of those," said Terry Maltese, the firm's founder.\par \par \uc2 U.S. Investigates \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , VTB and BNP Paribas for Roles in Selling Mozambique Debt\par \par \uc2 By Matt Wirz and Rebecca Davis O'Brien in New York and Jenny Strasburg in London\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Justice Department\uc2  and \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  are investigating three international banks for their roles in selling about $2 billion of debt for Mozambique, opening a new phase in the global inquiry into the bond deals, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Swiss lender \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG\uc2  CS -1.28% , Russian bank VTB Group and French bank \uc2 BNP Paribas SA\uc2  BNPQY -0.98% are focuses of the U.S. probes, the people said. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  is looking into whether the banks facilitated corruption by enabling Mozambican officials to take money raised in the debt sales, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Financial regulators in the U.S., the U.K. and Switzerland began probes into potential securities-law violations by the banks last year, after The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of irregularities in the Mozambican transactions. The newer U.S. inquiries widen the scope of the probes to include potential corruption and raise the possibility of criminal prosecution.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  has been trying to rehabilitate its international image for more than a year and recently restructured the investment banking unit that handled the Mozambican deals.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse's CEO \uc2 Tidjane Thiam\uc2  has been pushing to change the bank's culture of risk taking for several years with some success\u8212\'20\'14the bank settled a longstanding lawsuit from the financial crisis in 2016 and reported a sharp rise in third quarter profits this year as it focused more on wealth management.\par \par \uc2 When informed of the investigations by the Journal, Alex Vines, head of U.K. international-policy think tank \uc2 Chatham House\uc2 's Africa division, said they were "an important step toward greater transparency on how these undisclosed loans were negotiated. It is important for Mozambique's leadership to learn from past mistakes and will have international implications."\par \par \uc2 Spokeswomen for \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , VTB and BNP declined to comment. Two Mozambican government spokesmen didn't reply to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  began looking into the soured bonds around June 2016, when a small team of agents visited Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, according to people familiar with the situation. The securities-fraud unit of the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's New York field office has been investigating whether the banks facilitated improper payments to senior Mozambican officials, a person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Attorneys from the Justice Department's Washington, D.C., division specializing in money laundering and asset recovery met this summer with investors who had been sold the Mozambican bonds and requested they provide all documents and communications from the banks, according to the people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Justice officials also have met with \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  and VTB bankers and lawyers based in London, where the deals were originated, to discuss the transactions and follow-up dealings with investors and Mozambique, the people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  became involved in the deals in 2012, when the lender began discussions with defense contractor Iskandar Safa, who negotiated a deal to supply Mozambique with military and surveillance equipment through his company Privinvest Group. Mr. Safa asked \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  to help Mozambique borrow money to pay for the contracts.\par \par \uc2 From 2013 to 2014, the Swiss bank, VTB and BNP raised $2 billion in bonds and loans for companies owned by Mozambique's Defense Ministry, which contracted to buy equipment and services from Privinvest. About $1.2 billion of the debt wasn't publicly disclosed and, in an unusual twist, proceeds from the deals went straight from the banks to Privinvest rather than going first to the state-owned companies that borrowed the money, people involved in the transactions said.\par \par \uc2 After the Journal reported on the deals in 2016, donors including the International Monetary Fundsuspended hundreds of millions of dollars in direct aid to the impoverished country, citing concerns about how the money had been spent. The aid freeze triggered a currency crisis and worsened food shortages in Mozambique, which ranks 181st out of 188 countries on the United Nations' Human Development Index, a composite statistic including life expectancy, education and income.\par \par \uc2 The IMF commissioned investigations firm Kroll to audit the deals, and Kroll found that the prices of equipment to be provided by Privinvest exceeded what they should have cost by about $700 million, while an additional $500 million of the loan proceeds was unaccounted for.\par \par \uc2 "It is our view that, had Kroll assessed the pricing of the projects properly, using the correct assumptions and methodology, they would have found no discrepancy between the contract prices and value delivered," a Privinvest spokesman said. He also said the goods and services provided weren't military in nature and declined to comment on the Justice Department and \uc2 FBI\uc2  inquiries.\par \par \uc2 Revelations of the debts and the allegedly missing cash have sparked anger in Mozambique at the government and at the banks it hired.\par \par \uc2 "Clearly there was nothing to do with borrowing money\u8212\'20\'14at least the traditional way of borrowing money\u8212\'20\'14for development," said Adriano Nuvunga, program director for Mozambique's Center for Public Integrity, a watchdog group, speaking at a conference at \uc2 Johns Hopkins University\uc2  in March. "This, for us, is clearly an international corruption scandal."\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department is also examining whether the banks helped Mozambican officials borrow more debt than the country's economy could reasonably repay, said one of the people familiar with the matter. The deals increased Mozambique's national debt by 25% in 2013, and the country defaulted on its loans and bonds last year.\par \par \uc2 Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party has close ties to the military and former veterans and Defense Ministry officials, including current President Filipe Nyusi and former President Armando Guebuza, who hold or have held many top government posts, analysts say. The Mozambican government has denied any wrongdoing or corruption in the raising and spending of the funds through the disputed bonds.\par \par \uc2 The government's intelligence service and Defense Ministry created the companies that borrowed the debt, while the finance ministry provided government guarantees for the deal without obtaining the parliamentary approval required by law, according to public findings by Mozambique's parliament.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 SEC Questions Miami Firm About Guggenheim Ties\par \par \uc2 By Justin Baer and Margot Patrick\par \par \uc2 U.S. securities regulators recently asked a Miami wealth manager about its ties to both \uc2 Guggenheim Partners LLC\uc2  and a company that purchased an oceanfront home with Guggenheim Chief Executive \uc2 Mark Walter\uc2 , according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The questions came during an appearance late last month by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  to the Miami offices of Guggenheim Partners Latin America Inc., these people said.\par \par \uc2 GPLA was formed by Pablo Stalman and Juan Ball, who built the business within \uc2 Guggenheim Partners\uc2  before buying parts of it starting in 2009. Mr. Walter sat on its board until 2013. GPLA is now owned by London-based LJ Partnership.\par \par \uc2 During the SEC visit, according to these people, regulators queried GPLA about connections to Guggenheim and ABS Capital Company LLC, the Miami investment firm that joined with Mr. Walter to buy a $85 million Malibu mansion last May from film mogul David Geffen. ABS is owned by Messrs. Stalman and Ball and has offices in the same Brickell Avenue building as GPLA.\par \par \uc2 The visit was unannounced, these people said. LJ in a statement said the SEC visit was a periodic review. "We cannot comment on questions posed by the SEC but they cover a broad range of topics as would be expected in a periodic review," it said.\par \par \uc2 It is not known whether the visit from U.S. regulators was related to a continuing SEC examination of \uc2 Guggenheim Partners\uc2 , which manages more than $295 billion for insurance companies, pension funds and other clients. A former Guggenheim employee has filed a complaint with the SEC over the handling of certain transactions by the company, according to documents reviewed by The Journal.\par \par \uc2 The SEC declined to comment about the visit. A \uc2 Guggenheim Partners\uc2  spokesman declined to comment and referred questions to GPLA. ABS said no one at its company has been contacted by the SEC or any other regulator.\par \par \uc2 ABS's purchase of the Malibu mansion is one of two California real estate deals that have rankled Guggenheim employees and spurred questions from clients about possible distractions at the investment firm's money-management operations, according to clients and people familiar with the firm.\par \par \uc2 ABS also bought a $13 million Pacific Palisades home that was eventually occupied by Guggenheim distribution executive Alexandra Court, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Court once had a personal relationship with Mr. Walter, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mr. Walter previously said he was a partner on the Malibu home purchase but isn't an investor in ABS or an owner of the company, and didn't invest in Ms. Court's home. Ms. Court went on sabbatical from Guggenheim in June and is in talks to negotiate her potential departure from the firm, the Journal has reported.\par \par \uc2 Guggenheim's chief investment officer, \uc2 Scott Minerd\uc2 , said during a television interview in September that the firm was cooperating with the SEC's ongoing examination.\par \par \uc2 Guggenheim's connections to Messrs. Ball and Stalman go back to the creation of Guggenheim Partners Latin America as a private wealth business within the giant investment firm. It advises wealthy families in Argentina, Venezuela and other parts of Latin America on investments. LJ licenses the Guggenheim name for four of its units.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ball and Mr. Stalman have been reducing their stakes in LJ to focus on ABS, according to LJ company filings in London and people familiar with their activities. This week, LJ removed their names and another man's from a list of partners on its website. "As part of the review we are updating our website to reflect current management responsibilities," LJ said.\par \par \uc2 LJ's partners include two British members of the Guggenheim family that made its fortune in mining. \uc2 Guggenheim Partners\uc2  formed in 1999 from the combination of a business of Mr. Walter's and a small group managing money for the Guggenheim family.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: GOP Tax Bill Keeps the $50 Billion Line in the Sand for \u8216\'20\'18Big Banks'\par \par \uc2 By Christina Rexrode\par \par \uc2 There's plenty of talk in Washington that the $50 billion regulatory boundary that separates big banks from their smaller peers isn't the right measure. But the Republican tax bill unveiled Thursday seems to lend its support to that line, at least in one important way.\par \par \uc2 Under the proposed new tax plan, banks with more than $50 billion in assets would no longer get a deduction for paying premiums to the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . Although the bill's overall cut in the corporate tax rate will be a boon for most banks, the loss of the FDIC-assessment deductibility will sting. Charles Peabody, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, estimates this could shave 1% to 2% off the 2018 earnings per share at some of the biggest banks.\par \par \uc2 The use of $50 billion as a cut off could add to the controversy around that figure. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 set the $50 billion line as a marker where bank holding companies with more assets are deemed "systemically important." That makes them subject to stricter capital requirements, the Federal Reserve's stress tests and other rules.\par \par \uc2 But the $50 billion number was far from perfect, even to those writing the legislation. "All numbers are arbitrary, and in the rush, $50 billion seemed like a much bigger number," Barney Frank, the former Democratic congressman who with former Democratic Senator \uc2 Chris Dodd\uc2  was the driving force behind the bill, told the Wall Street Journal in an interview earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 The threshold has been a sore spot for regional banks like \uc2 Zions Bancorporation\uc2 , which has total assets of about $65 billion and doesn't appreciate being compared to the likes of \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., which has $2.56 trillion. Zions and other regional banks, like \uc2 KeyCorp\uc2  or \uc2 Fifth Third Bancorp\uc2 , would love nothing more than for the line to be bumped up to, say, $250 billion.\par \par \uc2 What's more, lawmakers and regulators even seem to agree, at least to a point. Though there's no consensus on where the boundary should be set, both Republicans and Democrats have said they think the line should be higher. The administration appears to be of a similar mind: Earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee that banks with $50 billion in assets don't pose "the same risk as a bank that has $750 billion or $2 trillion."\par \par \uc2 Thursday's tax bill, though, shows the $50 billion line is here to stay for at least a while longer.\par \par \uc2 China Central Bank Governor Points Out Risks Country Needs to Address\par \par \uc2 By Chao Deng\par \par \uc2 BEIJING\u8212\'20\'14China faces a multitude of risks to its financial system and needs to deepen changes and further open up, according to central-bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan.\par \par \uc2 In a lengthy article posted on the website of the \uc2 People's Bank of China\uc2  over the weekend, Mr. Zhou pointed out problems that need to be addressed, including the country's high debt levels, risky informal lending activities and financial "crocodiles" who have seized opportunities to collude with those in power.\par \par \uc2 Though "overall, our country's financial system is good," it is in a "risk-prone period" and subject to risks that are "hidden, complex and potentially sudden, contagious and harmful," he wrote. Mr. Zhou called for more centralized and unified financial regulation, and for markets to better serve the real economy.\par \par \uc2 The comments come after a party congress that handed President Xi Jinping a second five-year term. Some investors have been worried that China would intensify a campaign to rein in debt, even as leaders have prioritized financial stability.\par \par \uc2 China's debt-to-GDP ratio reached 247% by the end of 2016; corporate-sector leverage is disproportionately high at 165%.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zhou, who is widely expected to retire soon, has been on a streak of making stern comments. At a group meeting on the sidelines of the 19th Party Congress, he warned about a "Minsky moment," in which asset prices collapse suddenly after a long period of economic growth. The governor also called for greater transparency in China's public finances, saying at a seminar last month in Washington, D.C., that their murkiness means investors underestimate the risks of local-government debt,\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zhou's emphasis in his speeches this year contrasts starkly with his tone at the previous party congress in 2012. Back then, Mr. Zhou focused on specific measures of change, saying China must seize the opportunity to make the yuan fully convertible and to liberalize the capital account.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zhou kept his calls for reform general this time around, saying China should steadily promote the internationalization of the Chinese yuan and make its capital account convertible in a "safe and orderly" manner. Mr. Zhou said that markets should play a "decisive role" in allocating financial resources. Most of the article was about the need to address financial risks, including especially high leverage at state-owned enterprises and cross-border speculation by certain financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zhou warned of the need to prevent a "black swan," a term used to describe extreme events that are difficult to predict and more likely to happen than forecast. He also said China needed to prevent a "gray rhino," a term used to describe visible problems that are ignored until a late stage. In China, "gray rhino" has been used to describe conglomerates such as \uc2 Anbang Insurance Group Co\uc2 . and \uc2 HNA Group Co\uc2 ., which expanded quickly through political connections that enabled fast-paced global investments.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Liyan Qi contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Equifax Special Committee Clears Executives on Trades Before Breach Disclosure\par \par \uc2 By AnnaMaria Andriotis\par \par \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . on Friday said a board investigation exonerated four senior executives who sold shares in the days after the discovery of suspicious activity on its systems, moves that were viewed in a harsh light once the credit-reporting firm disclosed a hack that affected millions of Americans.\par \par \uc2 Three executives\u8212\'20\'14finance chief \uc2 John Gamble\uc2 , U.S. information solutions President Joseph Loughran and \uc2 Rodolfo Ploder\uc2 , president of workforce solutions\u8212\'20\'14collectively sold about $1.8 million in \uc2 Equifax\uc2  shares Aug. 1 and Aug. 2. The report also exonerated share sales by a fourth executive, Douglas Brandberg, senior vice president of investor relations, who wasn't previously named as among those selling.\par \par \uc2 The share sales came under scrutiny when \uc2 Equifax\uc2  disclosed in early September that a massive hack had compromised vital personal information of potentially 145.5 million Americans. The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  is investigating the share sales, and they also came up during congressional hearings into the hack.\par \par \uc2 Shares in \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , which were flat Friday, have declined about 25% since the company disclosed the breach.\par \par \uc2 The share-sale report was released by a committee created by \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's board to examine several aspects of the breach, including the executives' trades. The special committee found that "none of the four executives had knowledge" of the suspicious activity when their trades were made and that "preclearance for the four trades was appropriately obtained" and in line with company trading policy.\par \par \uc2 "None of the four executives engaged in insider trading," the report states.\par \par \uc2 The special committee hired \uc2 Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP\uc2 , one of the country's top securities law practices, to conduct the review, said William McLucas, a \uc2 WilmerHale\uc2  partner and former SEC enforcement director who conducted some of the interviews for the report. \uc2 Jamie Gorelick\uc2 , another \uc2 WilmerHale\uc2  partner and a deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, also was involved in investigating the stock sales and advising the special committee, Mr. McLucas said.\par \par \uc2 The board committee said the report was compiled following 62 interviews with current and former \uc2 Equifax\uc2  staffers, which included the executives who sold shares. The committee also reviewed more than 55,000 documents that included emails, text messages and phone logs, including those of the four executives.\par \par \uc2 The company has maintained since the breach that the executives were unaware of the attack when they sold the stock.\par \par \uc2 The report clearing the \uc2 Equifax\uc2  executives likely won't prompt the SEC to drop its investigation of their share sales, some securities law specialists said. And despite the exoneration, government securities regulators could still find "problematic activity related to the stock sales,'' said Charles Elson, a securities law specialist and head of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at \uc2 University of Delaware\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  has said that it discovered suspicious activity on its systems July 29. \uc2 Rick Smith\uc2 , who was chief executive at the time, has said he learned of the activity on July 31 but wasn't aware the company had been breached until around mid-August and that he then informed several senior executives and board members.\par \par \uc2 The share sales have also put the spotlight on the company's chief legal officer, \uc2 John J. Kelley\uc2 , whose office is ultimately responsible for signing off on the trades. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's board was reviewing the actions of Mr. Kelley in connection with the sales.\par \par \uc2 The report said the committee examined the role of the legal department and concluded that "neither Equifax's chief legal officer nor his designated preclearance officer had reason to believe" the four executives knew about the security incident when they requested preclearance and executed their trades.\par \par \uc2 The committee concluded the authorization given to the executives to trade was "within the authority permitted under [company] policy." The legal department on Aug. 15 imposed a "trading blackout" on company staff who were aware of the breach.\par \par \uc2 The committee's investigation was largely focused on determining at what point the executives who sold shares became aware of the security incident of late July that was later found to be a massive breach.\par \par \uc2 The report said a trading window for executives to sell \uc2 Equifax\uc2  shares opened July 28 and that an email sent to executives instructed them to receive preclearance from the legal department for any trades. The report also said that once approval for the share sales was given, it was valid for two days.\par \par \uc2 Senior executives learned of the suspicious activity and the company's investigation of it on different dates, according to the report. Among the four executives, Mr. Gamble was the first to find out, on Aug. 10. He received more information Aug. 17 and then separately at an Aug. 22 meeting with senior executives, where all four executives who sold shares were in attendance.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Loughran and Mr. Gamble emailed the company's legal department July 28 and July 31, respectively, requesting preclearance to sell shares; both received approval July 31. They sold their shares Aug. 1. Mr. Loughran first learned of the security issue Aug. 13, the report said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ploder and Mr. Brandberg sent emails to the legal department Aug. 1 requesting preclearance to sell shares and received approval the same day. They executed their trades Aug. 2. Mr. Ploder first learned of the security issue at the Aug. 22 senior-executive meeting. Mr. Brandberg first learned of the issue around Aug. 14, the report said.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Joann S.

Bitcoin, which only started trading in 2009, has long been a niche market and continues to be tarnished by its association with illicit activity.\par \par \uc2 Thanks to Mr. Duffy, it now has the blessing of the $47.6 billion global exchange giant.

As CME's chairman since 2002, Mr. Duffy helped turn the firm into the world's largest exchange operator, spearheading tie-ups with the \uc2 Chicago Board of Trade\uc2  in 2007 and the \uc2 New York Mercantile Exchange\uc2  in 2008. He also handled the delicate task of persuading \uc2 CME\uc2 's once-powerful floor traders to allow more electronic trading, drawing on his history in the pits to win support for the change.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duffy took the CEO job a year ago, after his predecessor unexpectedly retired. Since then, \uc2 CME\uc2 's share price is up nearly 20%. The move into bitcoin is by far the boldest step he has made as CEO.\par \par \uc2 "By nature I think he's a pretty conservative guy, but he will move swiftly when he needs to," said \uc2 Rich Repetto\uc2 , an analyst at \uc2 Sandler O'Neill + Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CME\uc2  was tight-lipped about its bitcoin plans before Tuesday's announcement, and some media reports suggested it had gotten cold feet. But behind the scenes, the company had long been laying the groundwork for the launch.\par \par \uc2 In November 2016, after close to a year of work, \uc2 CME\uc2  started publishing a daily bitcoin price index that will be the basis of its new futures contract. More recently, \uc2 CME\uc2  has consulted with outside advisers, including major bitcoin investors, about how its contract would work, people familiar with the situation said. At a New York meeting in May, the group discussed how \uc2 CME\uc2  should handle a "fork"\u8212\'20\'14a situation where a breakaway faction of programmers sets up an alternative version of bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duffy said he greenlighted the launch in October after repeatedly hearing from \uc2 CME\uc2  customers that they wanted bitcoin futures. He declined to say who lobbied him directly, but another \uc2 CME\uc2  executive said the firm heard from electronic-trading firms, hedge funds and exchange-traded-fund issuers, as well as banks whose own customers had been inquiring about bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 The 59-year-old CEO said he grew more comfortable with bitcoin after watching it survive repeated blows, such as a recent crackdown in China, a major hub for the digital currency.\par \par \uc2 "It's a story that just doesn't want to go away," he said.\par \par \uc2 CME\uc2  makes money by collecting fees when futures contracts are traded on its markets. That means it is neutral about the price of commodities, but its profits increase with heavier trading volume, which often goes hand-in-hand with spikes in volatility.\par \par \uc2 Creating a new market for bitcoin, which is notorious for wild price swings, could juice trading activity at \uc2 CME\uc2 , bringing in new fee income at a time when volatility across many of its markets has been muted. The digital currency has surged more than 600% this year, briefly hitting a record above $7,300 on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 But skeptics call the bitcoin phenomenon a bubble that will inevitably pop, with potential repercussions for \uc2 CME\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "If the market takes a dive and a lot of mom-and-pops are hurt, they will blame the futures market, just like they have done a hundred times in history," said Neal Wolkoff, former CEO of the \uc2 American Stock Exchange\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duffy knows the inherent risks in trading. As a young floor trader in 1981, he misheard a customer's order and lost $150,000, nearly ending his trading career. He was bailed out by his mentor at the time, a veteran trader named Vincent Schreiber. Mr. Duffy spent three years paying him back, with money earned from trading by day and bartending by night.\par \par \uc2 Today, a portrait of the late Mr. Schreiber sits in Mr. Duffy's office, amid framed photos of Hollywood stars and politicians whom the \uc2 CME\uc2  chief has befriended over the years, such as Hillary Clinton and John Boehner.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duffy, a registered Republican who has donated to politicians of both parties, is a seasoned operator in Washington and has testified on Capitol Hill dozens of times. His knack for courting regulators could help move \uc2 CME\uc2 's bitcoin plan forward and overcome the skepticism many officials hold toward the digital currency. \uc2 CME\uc2  needs signoff from its regulator, the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 , to launch its bitcoin contract.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duffy concedes that his big gambit may fail.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not saying this is going to work," he said. "But I do know there is pent-up demand for people to participate in it, and I'm going to offer it on a regulated platform."\par \par \uc2 Transparency Improves Within Private Companies\par \par \uc2 There's no such thing as too much information at Rubrik. That's because co-founder and Chief Executive Bipul Sinha {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-one-company-invites-all-employees-to-board-meetings-1509028866"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 runs the data-management startup under a strict code of radical transparency}}}\uc2 . Mr. Sinha is up front with executives about where they stand, and open with employees about the company's business and financial performance. He believes the extreme honesty helps create a strong corporate culture.\par \par \uc2 More companies have followed suit. Roughly 57% of 2,100 private-company chief financial officers said their organization provides at least some employees with regular updates on financial performance, up from 24% in 2012, according to surveys by Robert Half Management Resources.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sinha says there are good and bad sides to transparency. "If we create trust, then people take both good and bad news in stride because they know that it is part of a much bigger story that is unfolding," he said.\par \par \uc2 Monday, Nov. 6\par \par \uc2 NA\par \par \uc2 The Clearing House Association hosts its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.tchannualconference.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 annual conference}}}\uc2 , a gathering of bankers, regulators, and lawyers, in New York.\par \par \uc2 noon\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley speaks at an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2irht3x"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Economic Club of New York luncheon}}}\uc2  on lessons from the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday, Nov. 7\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The House Financial Services Housing and Insurance Subcommittee {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2zicpIK"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 holds a hearing}}}\uc2  on sustainable housing finance.\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Banking Committee {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2h16GwY"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 holds a hearing}}}\uc2  to consider a bill that would expand U.S. sanctions on North Korea and its financial facilitators and supporters.\par \par \uc2 12:35 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles speaks at the Clearing House {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.tchannualconference.com/program"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 annual conference}}}\uc2  in New York.\par \par \uc2 2 p.m.\par \par \uc2 The House Financial Services Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2zuMFKb"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 holds a hearing}}}\uc2  on proposals affecting the Federal Reserve.\par \par \uc2 Clearinghouse Resolution Is a Lingering Vulnerability\par \par \uc2 Thirty years after Black Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 22.6%, how to manage the insolvency of critical payment, clearing and settlement institutions is still an open question, according to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://voxeu.org/article/black-monday-thirty-years-after"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a report}}}\uc2  by Stephen Cecchetti and Kim Schoenholtz published by VoxEU.

The report notes the potential for monopolies or oligopolies to emerge among \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  outlets, suggesting none of the systems "are necessarily clever enough to fend off the forces of consolidation that bring about systemic risks." In addition, there are no rules for how to "teach" \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  models, making it "hard to see how their unpredictable nature can square with regulatory pressure to make trading models more interpretable," she writes.\par \par \uc2 Fortress Investment Group LLC\uc2  has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortress-hires-deutsche-hedge-fund-team-amid-legal-complaint-1509713492"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 hired a team of hedge-fund managers from Deutsche Bank AG}}}\uc2 , two of whom are the subject of a complaint from another U.S. hedge fund.\par \par \uc2 What's the world's most important asset?

The boost came mainly from its data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business, which grew by 6 per cent in the quarter. Revenues from its global broking and energy and commodities units were largely flat.\par \par \uc2 It added that fourth quarter revenues remained \u8220\'20\'1Cchallenging\u8221\'20\'1D and were up against strong comparative figures from a year ago, when markets were volatile after the US presidential election.\par \par \uc2 TP \uc2 ICAP\uc2  added that \uc2 Andrew Baddeley\uc2  would step down from the board with immediate effect but stay on until the end of the year. Robin Stewart, deputy chief financial officer, will take up the role on an interim basis. Mr Baddeley joined the company in May last year\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CLooking ahead we expect comparatively subdued market conditions for the fourth quarter of 2017 although we are well-placed to benefit from any interest rate rises in the US and Europe,\u8221\'20\'1D said John Phizackerley, chief executive.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe are sad to see \uc2 Andrew Baddeley\uc2  go, and wish him the best for the future. He has overseen the finance function at an intense period of change and growth for the group,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 For the nine months, TP \uc2 ICAP\uc2  said revenue of \u163\'00\'A31.3bn was 3 per cent higher than the same period a year ago, at constant exchange rates.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171103edb3002mh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

GIC has bought the shares from Indian conglomerate \uc2 Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd\uc2 ., which made its initial investment in the bank in November 2015. Indiabulls will own around 20% after the sale.\par \par \uc2 Last month, OakNorth secured a \u163\'00\'A3154 million investment from The Clermont Group, Toscafund and Coltrane, giving them a collective 16%.\par \par \uc2 OakNorth said the money raised will assist in ACORN machine's global expansion, ensuring that banks and lending institutions around the world are able to originate, underwrite, monitor, and book bespoke loans for small and medium-size enterprises faster and more efficiently.\par \par \uc2 ACORN machine is a financial technology platform composed of three pillars\u8212\'20\'14data, technology, and process. It collects millions of data items and then uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms to pull out the pieces of data that lenders need to make more informed credit decisions.\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive and co-founder Rishi Khosla said that the bank wasn't actively looking to raise extra funds but once it became aware of GIC's interest, the parties collectively agreed it would be hugely beneficial to the company if they did. Indiabulls therefore agreed to sell just under 10% of its stake to GIC.\par \par \uc2 Write to Ian Walker at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ian.walker@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ian.walker@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20171103edb3000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hedge-fund billionaire \uc2 Robert Mercer\uc2 , who gained attention outside Wall Street for supporting President Donald Trump, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/Mercer.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 is resigning }}}\uc2 as co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies LLC.\par \par \uc2 For over two decades, Mr. Mercer helped Renaissance generate gains that few rivals could match, thanks to the firm's pioneering use of closely held formulas and algorithms, an increasingly popular approach to trading known as "quantitative" investing.\par \par \uc2 But over the past year both Renaissance and Mr. Mercer have grown uncomfortable with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-mercers-a-quiet-tycoon-and-his-daughter-become-power-brokers-in-trumps-washington-1483904047"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 public focus on his political activities}}}\uc2 . Mr. Mercer wasn't happy that the firm recently received negative attention, according to someone close to the matter.\par \par \uc2 In recent weeks, some organizations have publicly tried to pressure universities, retirement funds and other institutional clients to pull money from the firm. One investor who called the firm Wednesday was told by a firm representative that negative publicity surrounding Mr. Mercer's political activities was a key reason behind his resignation, according to someone familiar with the call. The resignation will take effect on Jan. 1, 2018, although Mr. Mercer will remain a researcher at the firm.\par \par \uc2 The former computer programmer has long expressed distrust for the political establishment and in recent years was a backer of conservative media company Breitbart News. He was little known outside the investing world until he provided crucial financial support for Mr. Trump as the Republican's candidacy lagged in the summer of 2016.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mercer and his daughter Rebekah advised the Trump campaign and suggested the installation of two family confidants, \uc2 Steve Bannon\uc2  and Kellyanne Conway, atop the campaign. He and his wife were the third-largest donors to Republicans in the 2016 election. Mr. Mercer and his daughter remain close with Mr. Bannon, who has launched a campaign to back Republican insurgents in races around the country.\par \par \uc2 Over the past six months, Rebekah has shared frustrations with friends about how she and her father have been perceived and the perception that they supported racist and other causes, people close to the matter say. In a letter to employees sent Thursday morning, Mr. Mercer, 71, said that he has been subject to "scrutiny from the press" and that the media has unfairly linked him to Mr. Bannon.\par \par \uc2 "The press has\u8230\'20\'26intimated that my politics marches in lockstep with \uc2 Steve Bannon\uc2 's," he says in the letter. "I have great respect for Mr. Bannon, and from time to time I do discuss politics with him. However, I make my own decisions with respect to whom I support politically. Those decisions do not always align with Mr. Bannon's."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mercer said "for personal reasons, I have also decided to sell my stake in Breitbart News to my daughters."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mercer declined to comment through a spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bannon was given a heads-up on Mr. Mercer's plan to sell his Breitbart stake, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said he expected the two to "work even closer together on political projects." Representatives for Breitbart and Mr. Bannon couldn't be reached immediately to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mercer and his daughter have been involved in other initiatives of Mr. Bannon. Mr. Mercer partly owns Cambridge Analytica, a data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  firm whose board Mr. Bannon sat on before he joined the White House after the election. The Wall Street Journal has reported that \uc2 Rebekah Mercer\uc2  in August 2016 asked Cambridge's chief executive whether it could better organize the \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 -related emails being released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  in an effort to help Mr. Trump's campaign. The campaign paid the firm $5 million for campaign work.\par \par \uc2 The House Intelligence Committee last month contacted Cambridge Analytica for information related to the committee's probe of whether Mr. Trump's campaign or his associates colluded with the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, a company spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 The House panel referred questions to the company. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica said the company would fully cooperate with the probe but added that it isn't under investigation.\par \par \uc2 "There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the company," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mercer clarified his political views in his Thursday letter to employees, saying he supports "conservatives who favor a smaller, less powerful government." He said that he had supported right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos in an effort to back free speech and open debate, but that he now regrets the move.\par \par \uc2 "In my opinion, actions of and statements by Mr. Yiannopoulos have caused pain and divisiveness," Mr. Mercer wrote. "For several weeks I have been in the process of severing all ties with him."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yiannopoulos couldn't be reached immediately to comment but in a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post said: "I am grateful for Bob's help in getting me this far in my career. I wish him and the family all the best."\par \par \uc2 On Wall Street, where Mr. Mercer is known as much for his firm's investment record as for his political activity, his decision to relinquish management responsibilities at Renaissance caught some investors by surprise.\par \par \uc2 Some Renaissance executives have chafed at the unwanted publicity brought to the firm by Mr. Mercer's activities, according to people close to the matter. The firm, which was founded by billionaire and former code-breaker \uc2 Jim Simons\uc2 , manages $50 billion. Its signature Medallion fund has a record on par with that of investor \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2  and has been closed to investors for over a decade.\par \par \uc2 In his letter, Mr. Mercer said he also would resign from the firm's board of directors. Peter Brown, Renaissance's co-CEO, will continue as chief executive. Mr. Mercer said he would "continue with the firm as a member of its technical staff, focusing on the research work that I find most fulfilling."\par \par \uc2 Renaissance has faced more competition lately, as more investors embrace statistical models and algorithmic-driven trading. Despite that, the firm continues to best rivals. The firm's three funds available to outside investors are up between 10.5% and 15% so far this year, according to someone close to the matter, topping most hedge funds.\par \par \uc2 The firm, which managed $27 billion just two years ago, has seen $1 billion of new cash invested in the firm at the beginning of this month and more than $10 billion for the year, according to the person.\par \par \uc2 Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Gregory Zuckerman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Read More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/Mercer.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Read Mr. Mercer's Email to Staff}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/renaissance-dissident-sues-robert-mercer-for-wrongful-discharge-1494268221"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Renaissance Dissident Sues Robert Mercer for Wrongful Discharge }}}\uc2 (May 8)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/renaissance-feud-spills-over-to-hedge-fund-poker-night-1493424763"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Renaissance Feud Spills Over to Hedge Fund Poker Night}}}\uc2  (April 28)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-have-to-stop-renaissance-executive-tells-boss-about-trump-support-1487845803"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 'You Have to Stop,' Renaissance Executive Tells Boss About Trump Support}}}\uc2  (Feb. 23)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-mercers-a-quiet-tycoon-and-his-daughter-become-power-brokers-in-trumps-washington-1483904047"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Meet the Mercers: A Tycoon and His Daughter Become Power Brokers in Washington}}}\uc2  (Jan. 8)\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703494404575082000779302566"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Pioneering Fund Stages Second Act }}}\uc2 (March 16, 2010)\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171102edb200461\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Technological advancement and the rise of high-frequency trading has also made information on the stock market more valuable.\par \par \uc2 In October, the \uc2 US Treasury\uc2  delivered a comprehensive report on capital markets to President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  that included recommendations on market data. The report also highlighted the debate over the rise of high-frequency traders. Critics argue HFTs can seek to use speed along with market data feeds to trade ahead of long-term investors, who see their costs increased.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Sprecher\uc2 , \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s chief executive, told analysts on a earnings call on Thursday that \u8220\'20\'1Cthe controversy around this is a legacy issue that\u8217\'20\'19s been going on for a long time and we\u8217\'20\'19re still debating the Flash Boys mentality in a world where I don\u8217\'20\'19t believe that the same dynamics exist today\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 In the 2014 book Flash Boys, author Michael Lewis argued that the markets were \u8220\'20\'1Crigged\u8221\'20\'1D to the benefit of high-speed traders, setting off a firestorm around them that has since died down. Mr Sprecher said that exchanges like NYSE \u8220\'20\'1Chave gotten more sophisticated in the way we run our platforms to take out arbitrage. We\u8217\'20\'19ve been able to time markets. We measure cables, work with networks and so on and so forth that has essentially taken the Flash Boys type of behaviour out of the markets.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He also said that \uc2 ICE\uc2  had fielded \u8220\'20\'1Ca number of questions\u8221\'20\'1D from investors about NYSE\u8217\'20\'19s data sales since the Treasury report.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe sales of NYSE real-time equity data products are expected to be less than $90m in annual revenue to us and their growth has been relatively stagnant,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThese products account for approximately 2 per cent of \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s annual revenue and whether their growth continues to slow, stabilise or improve, over time, it will not be particularly meaningful to the growth plan that \uc2 ICE\uc2  is pursuing.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In the report, the Treasury recommended the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  consider whether data fees are \u8220\'20\'1Cfair and reasonable\u8221\'20\'1D when approving changes to them, wading into a bitter battle between brokers and exchanges over the cost of market data. It also said that data fees made up nearly a third of exchanges\u8217\'20\'19 $28.3bn in revenue in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Scott Hill\uc2 , \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s chief financial officer, added that the \u8220\'20\'1Cvast majority\u8221\'20\'1D of \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s $2bn data revenues come from \u8220\'20\'1Ca broad array of proprietary pricing data, reference data, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , indices, futures data and desktops and connectivity solutions across multiple asset classes and consumed by customers around the world\u8221\'20\'1D. He forecast that \uc2 ICE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s data revenues would grow 6 per cent in 2017 despite a general decline in revenues from real-time cash equity data products.\par \par \uc2 Exchanges also contribute to another data feed called the SIP, but this includes less information on the market making in stocks at any given moment and is delivered at a slower speed than proprietary feeds.\par \par \uc2 Since the release of the report, the SEC has named Brett Redfearn, former global head of market structure at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 , as the head of its trading and markets division. With Mr Redfearn having previously worked for a broker, the appointment fanned further speculation of an effort to revise the rules around pricing of stock market data feeds.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171102edb2009kj\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 National Australia Bank\uc2  said it would axe 4,000 jobs \u8212\'20\'14 about 12 per cent of its workforce \u8212\'20\'14 over the next three years in an effort to automate and simplify its business using new technologies.\par \par \uc2 The Australian lender announced the job cuts on Thursday as it reported a cash profit after tax of A$6.6bn ($5.1bn) for the 2016-17 financial year \u8212\'20\'14 a rise of 2.5 per cent on the previous year. The performance was boosted by growth in home and business lending and stronger markets and treasury income.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAs we simplify, we automate processes and things move to digital channels, we will need less people and as that happens we estimate that there will be 6,000 less people needed in three years\u8217\'20\'19 time,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Andrew Thorburn\uc2 , NAB chief executive.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHaving said that, we\u8217\'20\'19re hiring 2,000 people with different capabilities: data scientists, AI, robotics, automation, technology people, digital people, so the net [loss] will be 4,000 and that\u8217\'20\'19s just a reshaping that\u8217\'20\'19s going to happen.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Shares in \uc2 NAB\uc2  fell as much as 3 per cent to A$31.81 in early trading on an otherwise flat \uc2 ASX\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 NAB\u8217\'20\'19s job cuts follow a global pattern as lenders introduce new technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to replace customer support staff and digital channels that eliminate in-branch jobs.\par \par \uc2 In September \uc2 Vikram Pandit\uc2 , who ran \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  from 2007 to 2012, joined a chorus of industry leaders predicting disruption when he forecast 30 per cent of banking jobs could disappear over the next five years because of technology.\par \par \uc2 NAB said it would invest an extra A$1.5bn in new technologies and products to the end of 2020 in a bid to boost growth, particularly at its business and private banking units.\par \par \uc2 Mr Thorburn said digitisation, fintech and new global banking players were entering \uc2 NAB\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s market and it needed to adapt, particularly in the face of an uncertain global economy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19d rather face into this environment from a position of strength \u8212\'20\'14 and we\u8217\'20\'19re in that position today \u8212\'20\'14 rather than drift into it or someone else forces us to do it,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 NAB said the outlook for Australia and New Zealand economies remained supportive of solid growth.\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1CSome slowing in the housing cycle and a moderation in housing credit is expected, but downside is likely to be limited by strong population growth and low unemployment,\u8221\'20\'1D said the bank.\par \par \uc2 The net reduction in employee numbers will cost the bank A$500m-A$800m in the first half of 2018. NAB said it was targeting cost savings of more than A$1bn by the end of 2020.\par \par \uc2 NAB\u8217\'20\'19s net interest margin fell 3 basis points in the 12 months to end September, compared with the same period a year earlier. Net operating revenues grew 2.7 per cent to A$17.89bn.\par \par \uc2 UBS\uc2  said the result was \u8220\'20\'1Csolid\u8221\'20\'1D but that the bank had flagged higher than expected costs in coming years.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171102edb2000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Even so, proclamations that active management has already staged a resurrection seem premature. One telling statistic to emerge: only 6 per cent of this year's graduating class of MBAs from \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2  chose to go into investment management. This is the smallest number since records, released by Soifer Consulting, have been kept. Twice this proportion of Harvard MBAs wanted to be investment managers in 2011. Instead, far more head for private equity and venture capital.\par \par \uc2 The outlook for active managers is indeed grim. And as quants break down active management into separate factors that can be indexed and tracked like a normal index fund, the outlook appears worse. You can see why even a confident young Harvard MBA would want to steer clear.\par \par \uc2 None of what follows negates these sobering truths for the active management industry. But there are signs active managers are doing exactly what they need to do to retain their relevance. Most importantly, they are cutting fees. Also, there is work at the basic level of decision-making and psychology that can improve their processes. Behavioural consultants have been working for years to understand the processes that led to success, rather than merely look at outcomes (which might be driven by luck).\par \par \uc2 Inalytics, based in London, published a paper last month showing that active managers have moved in the right direction during the past decade. Looking at a sample of 488 portfolios that have made $5.9tn in trades and have beaten their indices by an There are signs they can retain their relevance \u8212\'20\'14 importantly, fees are falling average of 2.9 per cent per annum before fees, it found that the number of stocks they held has fallen during the past decade from about 140 to less than 70. That is as it should be \u8212\'20\'14 concentration is what they are paid to do, and gives them a better chance to outperform. It shows that they have confidence, and reflects research showing that funds can survive with even fewer stocks and still be well diversified.\par \par \uc2 Looking at the processes that distinguished the most from the least successful managers in the sample, Inalytics breaks it down into research \u8212\'20\'14 looking for the likely winners \u8212\'20\'14 and portfolio construction \u8212\'20\'14 that can be broken down into buying, sizing and selling decisions. A proxy for the research process is to analyse "first buys" of a new stock. In three-quarters of the outperforming portfolios, first buys generated positive returns. Large positions drive outcomes, and of the successful portfolios, 80 per cent had a top quintile of holdings that outperformed.\par \par \uc2 Skilled managers also allow their runners to win and cut their losers. Inalytics measured this by looking at "rockets" and "torpedoes" (stocks that manage to hole a portfolio beneath the waterline by continuing to drift down) \u8212\'20\'14 and found that 86 per cent of the outperforming portfolios had greater gains from rockets than losses from torpedoes.\par \par \uc2 A rival firm, Cabot Research has also published a paper suggesting signs of a turnround for active managers, based on measuring processes. They emphasise culture which, to quote Peter Drucker, "eats strategy for breakfast". That means doing away with the "rock star" culture, which gave us the likes of Peter Lynch and Bill Gross, in favour of encouraging collaborative groups that ideally include women, who can improve a group's collective intelligence partly as they have better social perceptiveness than men.\par \par \uc2 A group collaboration will outperform an individual, and many successful fund groups now organise that way. Cabot, like Inalytics, emphasises that technology can help active managers. Advances in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  make it easier to cover far more possibilities before drilling down, and also make it easier to eliminate flaws in reasoning.\par \par \uc2 When measuring investment skill, Cabot now champions use of "counterfactual portfolios" \u8212\'20\'14 looking at what outcomes would have resulted if individual buying, sizing or selling decisions had been reversed. This makes it possible to break down the process to see what has worked, and enables managers to identify their weakness. That can then be addressed by feedback or coaching.\par \par \uc2 All of these ideas could help move the active management industry back to a place where it has a viable role.\par \par \uc2 john.authers@ft.com\par \par \uc2 There are signs they can retain their relevance \u8212\'20\'14 importantly, fees are falling\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171102edb20008y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 National Australia Bank\uc2  said it would axe 4,000 jobs \u8212\'20\'14 about 12 per cent of its workforce \u8212\'20\'14 over the next three years in an effort to automate and simplify its business using new technologies.\par \par \uc2 The Australian lender announced the job cuts on Thursday as it reported a cash profit after tax of A$6.6bn ($5.1bn) for the 2016-17 financial year \u8212\'20\'14 a rise of 2.5 per cent on the previous year.

And yet Mr. Trump appears to have gone out of his way in recent days to heap praise on the current Fed Chairwoman, Janet Yellen.\par \par \uc2 It is both a shock pick and a perfectly rational selection.\par \par \uc2 It is a shock because it breaks with the longstanding tradition of first-term presidents renominating the incumbent Fed leader to avoid rattling markets. It is perfectly rational because \u8211\'20\'13 on almost all policy matters \u8211\'20\'13 Mr. Powell will follow the same course as current Chairwoman Janet Yellen. Investors, then, aren't likely to be rattled.\par \par \uc2 What they are, however, is perplexed. If Mr. Trump likes Ms. Yellen as much as he professes to why didn't he simply nominate her to a second term? Why go for a Yellen substitute?\par \par \uc2 Yes, Ms. Yellen would likely face a tough confirmation vote in the Senate but it is hard to see Republicans uniting to kill her nomination. And yes, Ms. Yellen would have provoked some teeth-gnashing in conservative circles, eager to undo the financial regulatory structures built up after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 But it is undeniable that the economy has improved under Ms. Yellen's tenure and the stock market has soared. For somebody like Mr. Trump, what's not to like? Why change horses midstream?\par \par \uc2 Chalk it up to our unpredictable president. People who make a living following foreign policy, military affairs, immigration and health care for a living have had plenty of experience scratching their heads contemplating White House decisions. Now it is time for those of us who follow monetary policy to join the club.\par \par \uc2 In the greater scheme of things, though, a Powell chairmanship will likely not be all that different from a Yellen chairmanship. If you're a Yellen fan, that should be good news.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments Around the World\par \par \uc2 Trump to Tap Fed's Jerome Powell for Fed Chairman\par \par \uc2 By Kate Davidson, Peter Nicholas and David Harrison\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The White House has notified Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell that President Donald Trump intends to nominate him as the next chairman of the central bank, according to a person familiar with the matter, a move likely to combine continuity on interest-rate policy with perhaps a lighter touch on financial regulation.\par \par \uc2 If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Powell would succeed Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, the central bank's first female leader, whose four-year term as Fed chief expires in early February.\par \par \uc2 In his five years at the Fed, Mr. Powell has been a reliable ally of Ms. Yellen and would likely continue the Fed's current cautious approach to reversing the central bank's crisis-era stimulus policies as the economy expands.\par \par \uc2 That would mean gradually raising short-term interest rates in quarter-percentage-point steps through 2020 while slowly shrinking the Fed's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities it purchased to lower long-term rates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell's nomination would mark the first time in nearly four decades that a new president hasn't asked the serving Fed leader to stay on for another term, even though that person was nominated by a president of a different party. The last time a first-term president didn't do that was in 1978, when President Jimmy Carter chose G. William Miller to succeed Arthur Burns.\par \par \uc2 The president spoke with Mr. Powell on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter who couldn't describe what they discussed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump had settled on Mr. Powell by Saturday, but people familiar with the process had cautioned that he could change his mind. The president plans to formally announce the decision Thursday before he leaves for a trip to Asia on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Reached by phone Wednesday, both Mr. Powell and Ms. Yellen declined to comment. A Fed spokeswoman also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen was one of five finalists for the position, along with Stanford University economics professor John Taylor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh didn't respond to requests seeking comment Wednesday. Mr. Cohn's spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said in a video last week that he had "somebody very specific in mind" for the job. "It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job," Mr. Trump said in a video posted to \uc2 Instagram\uc2  , adding, "I think everybody will be very impressed."\par \par \uc2 Fed officials began raising their benchmark federal-funds rate in December 2015 after holding it near zero for seven years following the financial crisis. They voted in June to lift rates to a range between 1% and 1.25% and in October started the process of slowly shrinking the Fed's bond portfolio.\par \par \uc2 "The economy is as close to our assigned goals as it has been for many years," Mr. Powell said in June. If it continues growing as expected, "I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates."\par \par \uc2 Officials have penciled in one more rate increase this year. But they indicated in September such increases are likely to end at a lower point than they had previously projected\u8212\'20\'14at a longer-run level of around 2.75%\u8212\'20\'14considerably lower than where officials have stopped raising rates in the past.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in July, "I'd like to see rates stay low."\par \par \uc2 The Fed on Wednesday left short-term interest rates unchanged, but signaled it would consider lifting them before year's end amid signs the economy is gaining momentum.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell has never dissented on a Fed monetary or regulatory policy vote and in speeches hasn't deviated far from the board's consensus.\par \par \uc2 Where he could lead a shift is on regulatory policy. He has advocated loosening some of the financial rules adopted by the Fed and other agencies since the crisis, a position that meshes with Mr. Trump's deregulatory agenda. Mr. Powell has suggested softening the Volcker rule barring banks from using their own money to make risky bets and easing some bank stress tests.\par \par \uc2 He also has endorsed reviewing some of the supervisory duties imposed on banks' boards of directors to prevent them from being burdened with "an ever-increasing checklist."\par \par \uc2 "More regulation is not the best answer to every problem," Mr. Powell said in a speech in early October.\par \par \uc2 "To some extent he offers Trump the best of both worlds. You get broadly speaking continuity of Yellen's careful and relatively dovish approach to monetary policy but with somebody who is a card-carrying Republican and who is significantly more inclined to revisit some of the postcrisis regulations," said \uc2 Krishna Guha\uc2  , vice chairman at Evercore ISI and a former \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  official.\par \par \uc2 Karen Petrou, managing partner of the financial-services consulting firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  , said Mr. Powell's recent remarks on regulation "were certainly much more flexible than [Ms. Yellen] has been."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell, a lawyer, would be the first Fed leader in three decades without a Ph.D. in economics. Before joining the Fed board, Mr. Powell worked as an investment banker in New York City, as Treasury undersecretary for financial institutions in the George H.W. Bush administration, as a partner at the \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2  and as a scholar at the \uc2 Bipartisan Policy Center\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 That background could serve him well, said \uc2 Aaron Klein\uc2 , an economic studies fellow at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  and director of the Center on Regulation and Markets.\par \par \uc2 "The Federal Reserve's mandate has grown significantly since the financial crisis," he said. "With a broader mandate, one should expect broader and more diverse backgrounds of potential good fits for a chair."\par \par \uc2 "He would represent continuity of the Fed system and culture but a break from the predominance of monetary policy as the core background of the chair," Mr. Klein said.\par \par \uc2 The decision marks the culmination of an unusually public and drawn-out search for one of the top economic policy-making jobs in the world.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump upended the usually staid selection process by openly weighing the pros and cons of various candidates and asking lawmakers, businesspeople and media personalities for their input.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump polled GOP senators last month on their preferred choice at a lunch on Capitol Hill, and said he was still considering "two, and maybe three" people for the job.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has other opportunities to reshape the central bank. Randal Quarles, his first nominee to the Fed's powerful seven-member board of governors, took office in October. Three other seats remain open.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen's term as a Fed governor doesn't expire until 2024, and she hasn't ruled out staying on in that position after her term as chairwoman ends. The decision would be unusual, but not unprecedented. Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles remained a governor for three years after not being reappointed to the top job by President Harry Truman.\par \par \uc2 Nominations for all board positions, including chairman and vice chairman, are subject to Senate confirmation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell should have little trouble winning Senate approval, but his views could clash with those of some Republican senators who have criticized him for supporting the Fed's easy-money and postcrisis regulatory policies.\par \par \uc2 He won confirmation to the Fed with bipartisan support in the Senate twice before: to fill an unfinished governor's term in 2012 and for a full term in 2014. Some Republicans have suggested he could face difficult questions from his own side of the aisle. "I think we should move in a different direction," from current Fed policies, Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said last month about the possibility of a Powell nomination.\par \par \uc2 Jerome Powell's Candidacy Offers Continuity in Fed Policy\par \par \uc2 By David Harrison\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump repeatedly praised Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen this year, but last week signaled he was likely to offer her job to someone else.\par \par \uc2 "You'd like to make your own mark," he told an interviewer.\par \par \uc2 In Jerome Powell, Mr. Trump picked a Republican who has consistently supported Ms. Yellen on policy and as Fed chief would likely keep the central bank on its current path.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell would "largely represent continuity," said Jonathan Wright, a former Fed economist now at \uc2 Johns Hopkins University\uc2  . His views "are all very consistent with the current consensus."\par \par \uc2 In his five years on the central bank's board of governors, Mr. Powell has never dissented on a monetary or regulatory policy decision.\par \par \uc2 He has supported the Fed's current course of slowly reversing its postcrisis stimulus efforts amid a strengthening economy. But he would be willing to use such measures again in a severe downturn, according to a review of his public remarks and interviews with people who have followed his career.\par \par \uc2 He also has largely endorsed the Fed's efforts since the financial crisis to strengthen regulations to make the banking system safer, while making clear in public remarks that he wants to adjust them.\par \par \uc2 And although Mr. Powell previously served in a Republican administration and donated money to GOP candidates before joining the Fed, he has argued against some GOP lawmakers' efforts to subject the central bank to greater congressional scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 Conservative critics of the Fed had urged Mr. Trump to nominate a chairman more likely to break with the recent past. Instead, he opted for more of the same.\par \par \uc2 If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Powell, a lawyer, would be the first Fed chairman in three decades without a Ph.D. in economics. But several Fed officials have said that being an academic economist is less important than being willing to learn.\par \par \uc2 Former Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, who served alongside Mr. Powell, said his pragmatic approach would serve him well as chairman.\par \par \uc2 "As an academic, we like the argumentation a little bit. That was not Jay Powell," said Mr. Kocherlakota, who now teaches at the \uc2 University of Rochester\uc2  . "He's about figuring out how can we take what's being said and moving it in a positive direction. He's very good at staying on that at all times."\par \par \uc2 Other former colleagues said Mr. Powell threw himself into his job at the Fed, studying up on economic theory and research ahead of speeches and policy meetings.\par \par \uc2 On monetary policy, he has supported gradually raising short-term interest rates and shrinking the portfolio of bonds the Fed purchased to boost the economy during and after the recession.\par \par \uc2 Despite some early misgivings, Mr. Powell has come to embrace the view\u8212\'20\'14forcefully articulated by Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke\u8212\'20\'14that the central bank should be prepared to take aggressive action to fight a recession.\par \par \uc2 The Fed in 2008 launched the first of three rounds of bond purchases aimed at stabilizing markets and lowering long-term interest rates. The move was untested and drew criticism from some economists and lawmakers that the Fed was risking a surge in inflation.\par \par \uc2 Barely a few months after joining the Fed in May 2012, Mr. Powell privately told his colleagues that he was worried the bond-buying would be ineffective and could roil markets. In his memoir, "The Courage to Act," Mr. Bernanke recounts how Mr. Powell had quietly urged him to find an "off ramp" allowing the Fed to wind down the programs.\par \par \uc2 In the end, the economy and the labor market continued to strengthen while inflation remained under control. Mr. Powell conceded he had been wrong.\par \par \uc2 "Let's let the data speak: The evidence so far is clear that the benefits of these policies have been substantial and that the risks have not materialized," he said in a speech in February 2015.\par \par \uc2 The Fed should be prepared to employ bond purchases again to support the economy if it is in dire shape and doesn't respond to interest-rate cuts, Mr. Powell said in February this year.\par \par \uc2 They "should be used only in extraordinary circumstances," he said. "I would want to be in a position where the [Fed] is in a place to respond to any downturn that might happen in a significant way."\par \par \uc2 Former Fed governor Laurence Meyer said Mr. Powell's experience with unconventional policy tools could reassure markets and households. The eight-year-old economic expansion won't last forever, he said. At some point, the central bank will have to decide how to react when interest rates have fallen near zero again and can't go any lower.\par \par \uc2 "He's been there during the implementation of the nonconventional policies and involved in discussions of alternative options and strategy when confronted with the zero-bound," Mr. Meyer said. "This is important because we will be there again."\par \par \uc2 On regulation, Mr. Powell has largely endorsed the Fed's efforts to strengthen bank supervision following the financial crisis. He backs requiring banks to hold more capital and liquid assets to protect them from shocks. He also supports the Fed's efforts to force large banks to come up with a resolution plan should they collapse.\par \par \uc2 In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee this summer, he said the rules adopted after the financial crisis helped make the financial system "substantially stronger and more stable." Mr. Trump, by contrast, has vowed to scrap many postcrisis rules, calling the 2010 Dodd-Frank law "a disaster."\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Powell also has highlighted areas where postcrisis rules could be eased. He has suggested softening the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from making overly risky bets with their own money. He has recommended making annual bank stress tests less burdensome. And he has proposed paring back requirements on bank boards of directors and managers, saying the Fed wanted to avoid imposing "an ever-increasing checklist" on bankers.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think what we're talking about here amounts to broad deregulation," he told the Senate Banking Committee this summer. "I think it amounts to making regulation more efficient, protecting the important gains we've made" since the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell spent three years in George H.W. Bush's Treasury Department, first as assistant secretary and then as undersecretary for financial institutions, and he saw firsthand how regulators can protect consumers from crumbling financial institutions. Shortly after he joined the administration in 1990, the department had to deal with a wave of more than 1,000 bank failures, most prominently the Bank of New England, at the time one of the region's largest banks, he recounted in a 2013 speech.\par \par \uc2 One Sunday morning in January 1991, Mr. Powell joined other regulators in a conference room to hash out how to deal with the bank's collapse. To prevent a bank run, which could destabilize the entire financial system, the group decided to guarantee all deposits, no matter how large they were.\par \par \uc2 Later that year, Mr. Powell helped handle the government's response to Salomon Brothers, an investment bank found to have rigged bids in Treasury auctions. The firm eventually settled, top executives resigned, and regulators allowed it to stay open.\par \par \uc2 "He learned a great deal about the classic problem of financial institutions. On the one hand trying to protect the market from systemic uncertainty and at the same time trying not to encourage more behavior problems," said \uc2 Robert Glauber\uc2  , a former Treasury undersecretary who was Mr. Powell's boss when he first came to the agency. "You develop the sense of where to strike that balance from experience, and Jay's had a great deal of it."\par \par \uc2 In a 2013 speech, Mr. Powell said he had come to understand the importance of making banks more resilient. If they do fail, however, there should be a process in place to limit the risk of a banking crisis or of a government bailout, he said.\par \par \uc2 "The market needs to believe\u8212\'20\'14and it needs to be the case\u8212\'20\'14that every private financial institution can fail and be resolved under our laws without imposing undue costs on society," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell could clash with Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill over the question of the central bank's discretion.\par \par \uc2 He has criticized GOP-sponsored House bills that would require the \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  to evaluate the Fed's monetary policy and would direct Fed officials to adopt a mathematical rule to guide their policy.\par \par \uc2 The legislation assumes the Fed acted inappropriately and with too much secrecy in its response to the financial crisis, Mr. Powell said in a February 2015 speech.\par \par \uc2 "The Fed's actions were effective, necessary, appropriate, and very much in keeping with the traditional role of the Fed and other central banks," he said. "Most importantly, I believe these proposals fail to anticipate the significant costs and risks of subjecting monetary policy to political pressure and constraining the Fed's ability to carry out its traditional role of providing liquidity in a crisis."\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Powell, as chairman, resists political efforts to bring the Fed under closer congressional supervision, he would be following in the footsteps of his predecessors, regardless of their party affiliation, said Mr. Meyer, the former Fed governor. Mr. Powell might be able to develop bonds with Mr. Trump and with Republican lawmakers to ease that task, he said.\par \par \uc2 "This is a core value of every chairman: that the chairman is responsible for guarding the independence of the Fed," Mr. Meyer said. "You want somebody who is skillful at building personal relationships and reducing the vulnerability of the Fed to political interference. I think Powell would be very effective here."\par \par \uc2 Yellen's Exit as Fed Chief Would Mark Break From Recent Precedent\par \par \uc2 By Josh Zumbrun\par \par \uc2 Janet Yellen's leadership at the Federal Reserve looks set to end after just one four-year term, the shortest tenure at the helm of the central bank in nearly four decades, and a break from recent precedent: The previous three Fed chairmen all were reappointed by presidents from the opposite party that put them in office.\par \par \uc2 The White House has notified Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell that President Donald Trump intends to nominate him to succeed Ms. Yellen when her term as central bank chief ends in February, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Given her predisposition to plot moves well in advance, she likely will make no more major decisions at the central bank beyond the next quarter-point interest-rate increase, which many market participants expect to come in December.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen, the Fed's first female chief, led her colleagues to slowly and cautiously reverse the central bank's extraordinary stimulus programs adopted during the financial crisis, the subsequent recession and the sluggish recovery.\par \par \uc2 She built consensus within the central bank to move in well-telegraphed, measured steps to avoid roiling markets and disrupting the economy's slow progress.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's decision comes as the economy is growing steadily and the labor market is at or near full strength. The Fed, however, failed on her watch to achieve its goal of 2% inflation.\par \par \uc2 During the first 16 months of her leadership, the Fed held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero as the unemployment rate fell and economic growth strengthened.\par \par \uc2 In December 2015, she guided the central bank to its first rate increase in seven years. The Fed has raised rates three times since then and in October bean shrinking the $4.2 trillion portfolio of bonds it purchased during and after the financial crisis to stabilize markets and boost the economy.\par \par \uc2 "She had to walk, and is still walking, a very fine line between a still fragile economy and risks of leaving too much accommodation in place for too long," said Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro and a former Fed economist. "I think she managed to strike the right balance."\par \par \uc2 It wasn't a foregone conclusion that the first postcrisis tightening of monetary policy would go so smoothly. In 2011, for example, the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  raised rates, but set its economy reeling, exacerbated the continent's debt crisis and swiftly reversed course. In 2013, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke sent the Treasury market into a tailspin with remarks\u8212\'20\'14catching many investors off guard\u8212\'20\'14that the Fed would soon wind down its bond buying.\par \par \uc2 But under Ms. Yellen, U.S. financial markets have taken the Fed's moves in stride.\par \par \uc2 "Janet Yellen hasn't gotten enough credit for being right about the economy," said Russell Price, senior economist for Ameriprise Financial, adding that despite public debates around her moves, there have been no large and obvious policy screw-ups during her tenure.\par \par \uc2 Before the financial crisis, the Fed had never pushed interest rates so low, nor engaged in the bond-buying programs that dramatically expanded its asset holdings. There was therefore no playbook for the reversal of those policies.\par \par \uc2 "She's done a darn good job getting consensus around some very difficult questions on how to do this unwind\u8212\'20\'14they've made some very difficult decisions in a situation with no precedent," said former Fed Vice Chairman \uc2 Donald Kohn\uc2  , now a senior fellow at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Because her policies were built upon broad consensus among the Fed's governors and presidents, it could be difficult for her successor to swiftly shift course.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen came to the top job with a deep understanding of the central bank that began when she first joined as a staff economist in the 1970s. She later became a professor at the University of California-Berkeley, her longtime academic perch.\par \par \uc2 She returned to the Fed in 1994, when she was appointed to the Fed's board of governors by President Bill Clinton. She left the Fed again in 1997 to serve for two years as the chairwoman of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.\par \par \uc2 After a stint back at Berkeley, she rejoined the central bank in 2004 as president of the San Francisco Fed. She was elevated twice by President Barack Obama, becoming vice chairwoman in 2010 and then chairwoman in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Many Republicans in the Senate who opposed her feared her policies would be too dovish\u8212\'20\'14favoring low interest rates and higher inflation. Instead, she has raised rates and inflation has languished below the Fed's 2% target.\par \par \uc2 The national unemployment rate was at 4.2% in September\u8212\'20\'14the lowest level since early 2001\u8212\'20\'14down from 6.6% when Ms. Yellen took office in early 2014.\par \par \uc2 As an economist who focused much of her research on labor markets, Ms. Yellen often emphasized that the national unemployment rate was understating the true amount of slack in the U.S. labor market. She cited broader rates of underemployment, such as rates including people who had stopped looking for work, and people who were employed part time but wanted full-time work. The broadest underemployment rate from the Labor Department was 8.3% in September, down from 12.7% when Ms. Yellen took the helm.\par \par \uc2 "Judging against the sweep of history, under her chairmanship policy has moved the economy broadly toward the two objectives that the Congress gave the Federal Reserve," said Mr. Kohn, referring to the central bank's so-called dual mandate to achieve stable inflation and maximum employment. "The inflation is a little bit in doubt right now, but you have to be careful there. Monetary policy works with long and variable lags."\par \par \uc2 Some observers wonder if Ms. Yellen has erred on the side of allowing too little inflation. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the annual change in the personal-consumption expenditures price index, ticked above 2% briefly in early 2017 but has since dropped to 1.6%.\par \par \uc2 While Ms. Yellen's term as Fed chairwoman looks to be winding down, her term as a Fed governor doesn't expire until 2024, and she hasn't ruled out staying on in that position.\par \par \uc2 A decision to stay would be unusual, but not unprecedented. Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles remained a governor for three years after not being reappointed to the top job by President Harry Truman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump sometimes criticized the Fed's policies during the presidential campaign. But once in office he appeared to warm to Ms. Yellen, and said in July he was considering offering her a second term.\par \par \uc2 "I like her; I like her demeanor. I think she's done a good job," he said in a July interview with The Wall Street Journal. "I'd like to see rates stay low. She's historically been a low-interest-rate person."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said Wednesday she is "excellent."\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, however, Mr. Trump opted to bring her term as chairwoman to an end.\par \par \uc2 Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged, Cites \u8216\'20\'18Solid Rate' of Economic Growth\par \par \uc2 By David Harrison\par \par \uc2 The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged Wednesday, but suggested it remained on course to lift them before year's end amid signs the economy is gaining momentum.\par \par \uc2 Officials have penciled in one more move for 2017 if the economy stays on track. The Fed has one more meeting scheduled before the end of the year, on Dec. 12-13. The central bank has raised its benchmark federal-funds rate four times since late 2015, in quarter-percentage-point steps, to a current range between 1% and 1.25%.\par \par \uc2 "Economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions," the Fed said in a statement Wednesday after the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.\par \par \uc2 Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the U.S., rose at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. That followed 3.1% annualized growth in the spring, for the best six-month stretch of growth in three years.\par \par \uc2 The storms that hit the Gulf Coast and Florida in late summer "are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy in the medium term," the Fed said.\par \par \uc2 Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in her most recent public remarks, kept the door open to another rate increase this year, saying the "ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases." But she didn't say when the next move was likely.\par \par \uc2 Market expectations for a rate increase in December are high, and Fed officials have done little to dispel them.\par \par \uc2 Several analysts said the Fed included no surprises in its statement and anticipated a rate increase at the December meeting.\par \par \uc2 "It remains reasonable, barring some large outside shock to the economy, to expect a hike at the Fed's meeting next month," said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at \uc2 J. P. Morgan\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Robust household spending, upbeat consumer sentiment, a strong labor market and better growth overseas are likely to offer support for Fed officials inclined toward raising rates before year's end to ensure the economy doesn't overheat. While U.S. employers shed 33,000 jobs in September\u8212\'20\'14largely attributed to the recent hurricanes\u8212\'20\'14the statement noted that the unemployment rate "declined further." The unemployment rate dropped to 4.2% in September, the lowest level since 2001. Ms. Yellen also said recently that progress on average hourly earnings was "encouraging."\par \par \uc2 Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in an October interview that if the economy performs as expected, "December seems like a reasonable time" for another rate rise.\par \par \uc2 Atlanta Fed President \uc2 Raphael Bostic\uc2  told reporters in September, "I am at this point looking\u8212\'20\'14feeling pretty comfortable about the idea that we will be looking to move rates come December."\par \par \uc2 Some officials, however, have said recently they want to see more evidence that inflation is rising toward their 2% target before they support another rate rise. The Fed's preferred price gauge, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, rose 1.6% on the year in September, but that was largely because of a storm-related surge in gasoline prices. So-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items, were up 1.3%.\par \par \uc2 Central bankers generally like to see inflation holding steady at around 2% because it signals a growing economy and allows them to hold rates high enough that they can safely cut them to fight an unexpected downturn.\par \par \uc2 Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who voted against the central bank's two rate increases this year, wrote in an essay last month, "My preference would be not to raise rates again until we actually hit" 2% inflation.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen has described the inflation undershoot in recent months as a "mystery," though her "best guess is that these soft readings will not persist."\par \par \uc2 The Fed meeting occurred as President Donald Trump was preparing to announce his pick to lead the central bank after Ms. Yellen's term as chairwoman expires in February. Although he has praised her and considered offering her a second term, Mr. Trump is likely to nominate Fed governor Jerome Powell, perhaps as soon as Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell has been an ally of Ms. Yellen on monetary policy, saying at an event last month the Fed's efforts to raise interest rates from postcrisis lows to a more normal level "should continue to be gradual, as long as the U.S. economy evolves roughly as expected."\par \par \uc2 The Fed meeting was also the first attended by Mr. Trump's first nominee to the Fed board, Randal Quarles, who took office last month as the central bank's vice chairman for supervision.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Quarles, along with the other board members and five regional Fed bank presidents, are voting members of the central bank's policy committee.\par \par \uc2 The committee's vote was unanimous.\par \par \uc2 Fed's Likely New Chief Has Some Worries About China\par \par \uc2 By Gregor Stuart Hunter\par \par \uc2 How will Jerome Powell deal with the world's second-largest economy as head of the Federal Reserve? Speeches from the clear favorite to be the U.S.'s next central bank chief give a clue into his thinking about China\u8212\'20\'14including his worries about the country's burgeoning debt levels.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump plans to nominate Mr. Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve to replace Janet Yellen, whose four-year term as Fed chief expires in early February, a person familiar with the matter has told The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 China's economy has become an important consideration for the Fed in the past few years. Bouts of volatility in the Chinese yuan, in particular, have proven capable of altering the U.S. central bank's policy decisions. And while the Fed's mandate is focused on domestic employment and inflation, the outsize role that the U.S. plays in the global economy means it has to take conditions elsewhere into account in its deliberations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell has given six speeches mentioning China since he was appointed in May 2012, according to the Journal's speech analyzer, including two major speeches on emerging-market economies within the past year.\par \par \uc2 Speaking last month at an Institute of International Finance event in Washington D.C., Mr Powell warned of the threats posed by burgeoning debt levels in emerging economies, especially in China.\par \par \uc2 While the "roughly" $27 trillion in debt owed by corporations in emerging markets at the end of the first quarter this year was triple the level of 2008, he said most of these companies had been able to generate enough earnings to cover interest payments at least twice over.\par \par \uc2 "The situation is not alarming, but risks are significant and bear close watching, especially in China," he said.\par \par \uc2 In China, the share of risky debt was much more troubling, Mr. Powell said. "For China, though, the debt-at-risk now exceeds what we saw in East Asia before the Asian crisis," he said.\par \par \uc2 Prior to that, Mr. Powell gave a speech in November 2016 at the \uc2 San Francisco Fed\uc2  on a slowdown in global trade flows, in which he made several references to China.\par \par \uc2 He pointed to a slowdown in the country's trade flows as a 15-year expansion in manufacturing, powered by supplies of cheap labor in the Chinese countryside, showed signs of "reaching its natural limit."\par \par \uc2 "Ongoing structural changes within the Chinese economy, including rebalancing toward domestic demand, are exerting an independent effect on world trade flows," he said at the time.\par \par \uc2 "Although global factors have undoubtedly played a role, however, the evidence suggests that a substantial part of the slowdown in Chinese trade reflects developments that are specific to the Chinese economy and that are likely to exert a lasting imprint on global trade."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell's remarks about China have been more numerous than those of Ms. Yellen, who has largely made only passing references to Asia's largest economy in 13 speeches and testimonies since 2012.\par \par \uc2 That's not to say China didn't feature in the Federal Open Market Committee's decisions under her tenure as chairwoman. The Fed held off from raising interest rates in September 2015, stating that it was "monitoring developments abroad"\u8212\'20\'14a statement interpreted by the market as referring to China's surprise shift to a market-determined exchange rate for the yuan during the previous month, which sparked volatility in capital markets worldwide.\par \par \uc2 Investors' Query to the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  : Is This a One-Off Rate Rise?\par \par \uc2 By Jon Sindreu\par \par \uc2 Investors are certain the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  will raise rates Thursday. They also seem certain the central bank won't do it again for a long time. That means there is a potential for surprises to shake U.K. markets.\par \par \uc2 Derivatives markets assign an 85% probability to U.K. officials raising interest rates this week for the first time in a decade. Over the past two months, the pound has gained 2.5% and 4.3% against the U.S. dollar and the euro, respectively, fueled by hints from BOE officials that monetary policy is set to be tightened.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, yields on 10-year \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  bonds in the same period have risen to 1.333% from 1.060%.\par \par \uc2 Key for the U.K. currency and bonds now is whether a BOE rate rise would be read as the start of a tightening cycle.\par \par \uc2 "That's the crux of the matter, is it \u8216\'20\'18one and done' or there's more to come?" said David Katimbo-Mugwanya, a fixed-income fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, who thinks the government bond market is likely to sell off on Thursday as sterling rallies.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts warn that market players may be getting ahead of themselves in their predictions. Trading in derivatives called overnight index swaps shows investors believe the central bank will raise its benchmark rate from 0.25% to 0.5%\u8212\'20\'14where it was before the Brexit vote last year\u8212\'20\'14and leave it there until November of next year.\par \par \uc2 But officials could signal otherwise, economists said.\par \par \uc2 "There's a real vulnerability in the market if they indicate the next hike might come a bit sooner, and that would be good for sterling," said Stephen Gallo, head of foreign-exchange strategy at \uc2 BMO Financial Group\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Such a surprise could boost the pound by between 0.7% and 1.3% against the dollar, according to a range of estimates by economists. Yields on 10-year government bonds could edge up, closer to the 1.5% mark.\par \par \uc2 Speculators now have a small bet on the pound strengthening, according to the \uc2 U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  . The last time that was the case was in late 2015.\par \par \uc2 A rise in the pound would dent the FTSE 100, since two-thirds of revenue for its constituent companies comes from outside the U.K. When the sterling strengthens, the conversion of such revenue into pounds is less favorable for U.K. companies, and investors bid down shares in response.\par \par \uc2 Viraj Patel, foreign-exchange analyst at Dutch bank ING, deems it unlikely that BOE officials will deliver the dovish message that investors expect because it might limit their options to raise rates sooner if necessary.\par \par \uc2 "How would the BOE even signal a one-off rise?," Mr. Patel said. "No central bank will do that, they want to keep it open-ended." He expects the pound to hover around $1.35 at year-end.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, if policy makers shock markets by deciding not to raise rates, sterling could end up falling as much as 4%, economists said. That could send the U.K.'s flagship stock index higher.\par \par \uc2 Jitters about the BOE's decision underscore an important issue for U.K. markets: Even though most investors are very confident that rate setters will decide to nudge up borrowing costs, there is a large degree of confusion about the reason for doing so.\par \par \uc2 Over the past few months, the case for raising rates has sometimes been argued in conflicting ways by officials at the central bank. BOE Governor Mark Carney has voiced concern about Britain's decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  constraining the domestic supply of goods and thus fueling inflation.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, BOE Chief Economist \uc2 Andy Haldane\uc2  has often expressed optimism about the health of the British economy, whose growth accelerated to 0.4% in the third quarter, official figures showed last week. In that scenario, interest rates could be raised without fear of stalling out economic expansion.\par \par \uc2 As a third possibility, recent research by the U.K. central bank suggests that sterling's depreciation after Brexit could have a more lasting effect than previously expected, as companies continue to pass on the cost of higher imports to consumers in the following months. Some economists believe that policy makers could be driven to offset this effect by pushing up rates and shoring up the pound.\par \par \uc2 Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg Bank, thinks how many members of the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee back a rate increase will "matter a lot" for markets and how they read the decision.\par \par \uc2 On average, analysts expect seven out of nine members to vote in favor of increasing rates, so a larger consensus would probably spark a reaction.\par \par \uc2 "If all MPC members back the hike, markets will say surely it's not going to be one and done," Mr. Pickering said.\par \par \uc2 SNB Vice Chairman Defends Negative Rates\par \par \uc2 By Brian Blackstone\par \par \uc2 ZURICH\u8212\'20\'14A top \uc2 Swiss National Bank\uc2  official defended its negative interest rate policy Wednesday, saying it was necessary to keep the Swiss franc from strengthening too much and depressing consumer prices.\par \par \uc2 "A higher interest rate level domestically would result in further appreciation of the Swiss franc. This would cause a slowdown of economic growth and put the prices of goods and services under pressure," said SNB Vice Chairman \uc2 Fritz Zurbr\u252\'00\'FCgg\uc2  in prepared remarks at the University of Berne in the Swiss capital.\par \par \uc2 "The low reference rate maintained by the SNB is therefore necessary from a monetary policy perspective in the context of the low interest rate environment world-wide and the strong Swiss franc," he added.\par \par \uc2 The SNB's deposit rate has been at -0.75% since January 2015, which was when the SNB abandoned a longstanding ceiling on the franc's value against the euro. The euro has strengthened against the franc in recent months and fetched 1.1637 francs in late European trading Wednesday. In September, the SNB softened its long-held view on the franc's strength to "highly valued" from "significantly overvalued."\par \par \uc2 Given Switzerland's sensitivity to the eurozone economy, analysts generally don't expect the SNB to raise interest rates until the ECB does. Capital Economics said in a research note Wednesday that the SNB would likely hold interest rates until 2020.\par \par \uc2 One side effect of ultra-low interest rates has been a boom in Swiss home prices and mortgage lending.\par \par \uc2 "Momentum on the mortgage and real-estate markets has been considerably stronger in recent years than can be explained by such fundamental developments," Mr. Zurbr\u252\'00\'FCgg said.\par \par \uc2 He noted that the ratio of outstanding mortgage loans to gross domestic product had risen to around 145% in 2017 from 110% in 2000.\par \par \uc2 The SNB, he said, "has been carefully monitoring these developments for some time and pointing out the associated risks."\par \par \uc2 Quick Hits: BOE Could Follow ECB in \u8216\'20\'18Dovish Tightening'\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  could announce "dovish tightening" Thursday, the \uc2 People's Bank of China\uc2  injected $75.07 billion of liquidity via a medium-term lending facility in October, and a softer inflation reading may not spell a rate cut for Indonesia. Here are quick hits on central banking and related market views from around the world.\par \par \uc2 BOE Could Follow ECB in \u8216\'20\'18Dovish Tightening'\par \par \uc2 Last week, the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  delivered what some analysts have called a dovish tapering: a cut in monthly bond purchases but an open-ended extension to quantitative easing with an emphasis on reinvestments. On Thursday, the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  could deliver its own version of dovish tightening of monetary policy: a 25-basis-point increase in its policy rate, as broadly expected, while emphasizing that further tightening will be data-dependent. And with the economy expected to slow in 2018 ahead of Brexit, an opportunity to raise rates further will be limited, \uc2 Soci\u233\'00\'E9t\u233\'00\'E9 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale\uc2  strategists say in a note.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Tasos Vossos\par \par \uc2 BOE Guidance Hints at 6-3 Vote for Rate Rise: Bank of America Merrill Lynch\par \par \uc2 While there is still some chance that the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  will refrain from increasing its bank rate, the "strongly worded guidance" from rate setters points to a 6-3 vote outcome in favor of a rise Thursday, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. It sees David Ramsden, Silvana Tenreyro and \uc2 Jon Cunliffe\uc2  as dissenters. The BOE is expected to signal the start of a "limited and gradual" cycle, which should rule out a second increase in February, BAML says. "While we think the BOE's language should rule out a second hike in February, the risks seem skewed toward a hawkish message relative to broader market pricing of three hikes in three years," BAML says.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Emese Bartha\par \par \uc2 BOE Rate Rise Could Be Approved With 7-2 Vote: \uc2 TD Securities\par \par \uc2 TD Securities\uc2  says it expects the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  to raise the bank rate by 25 basis points Thursday, possibly with a 7-2 vote in favor of a rise, albeit with risks of an 8-1 or 6-3 vote outcome. The Monetary Policy Council is likely to reiterate that the bank rate will need to increase at a faster pace than markets currently expect, \uc2 TD Securities\uc2  says, pointing to markets' expectations of three rate rises by 2020. \uc2 TD Securities\uc2  sees another increase in February 2018, to be followed by a pause until Brexit uncertainty is resolved. Two further rises may follow in 2019, it adds.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Emese Bartha\par \par \uc2 Potential BOE Rate Rise to Start Cautious Cycle\par \par \uc2 The widely expected rate rise in the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  's policy rate Thursday could be the start of a "cautious and gradual" tightening cycle, AXA Investment Managers says in a note. The asset manager expects a second rise in 2018 and two more rises in 2019. Thursday's potential rate rise will be the BOE's first since July 2007, when it increased its policy rate to 5.75% from 5.5%.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Tasos Vossos\par \par \uc2 Japan PM Plans \u165\'00\'A52 Trillion Productivity, Human Resources Package\par \par \uc2 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Wednesday that he has planned a package of measures worth 2 trillion yen ($17.5 billion) to improve productivity in the country and develop human resources. Mr. Abe didn't give specifics on how the \u165\'00\'A52 trillion would be spent, but said that the government wants to encourage investment to boost productivity at a time when many companies are suffering from a shortage of labor. He also reiterated a pledge to make preschool free for all and create more day-care slots\u8212\'20\'14moves that could encourage more mothers of young children to enter the workforce or increase the number of hours that they work. Asked whether he planned to reappoint Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda, whose term expires next April, Mr. Abe said the question was still a "blank slate." He said he has high regard for Mr. Kuroda's abilities and praised the BOJ for contributing to an improved economy.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Peter Landers\par \par \uc2 PBOC Injected 498 Billion Yuan of Liquidity Via Medium-Term Lending Facility in October\par \par \uc2 China's central bank\uc2  said Wednesday it pumped 498 billion yuan ($75.07 billion) of liquidity into the country's banking system in October through a medium-term lending facility. \uc2 The People's Bank of China\uc2  said the MLF carries an interest rate of 3.2% and a maturity of one year, both unchanged from previous operations. The outstanding MLF stood at 4.41 trillion yuan ($664.80 billion) at the end of October. The central bank also extended 38.4 billion yuan in loans via pledged supplemental lending to China's three policy banks last month. The outstanding PSL was 2.58 trillion yuan at the end of October. The PBOC also injected 24.95 billion yuan via the standing lending facility last month; the outstanding amount was 22.32 billion yuan.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Grace Zhu\par \par \uc2 Softer CPI May Not Spell Rate Cut for Indonesia\par \par \uc2 Eased inflation last month may not prompt \uc2 Bank Indonesia\uc2  to cut rates in November, analysts say. The central bank surprised the market with quarter-point reductions in both August and September before deciding to stay on hold last month. The rupiah has fallen nearly 2% versus the dollar since the second cut, and Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Gov. Mirza Adityaswara said Tuesday that room for a rate cut has diminished. October's 3.6% gain in the consumer-price index was slightly less than expected.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14I Made Sentana\par \par \uc2 Canadian Dollar \u8216\'20\'18Vulnerable' as Poloz Preaches Caution\par \par \uc2 The Canadian dollar looks "most vulnerable" right now, with \uc2 Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz\uc2  preaching caution on rates and the Federal Reserve setting the stage for another rate increase this year, Gluskin Sheff's chief economist, \uc2 David Rosenberg\uc2  , says. He cited testimony Tuesday from Mr. Poloz before a parliamentary committee, in which he said "significant uncertainties" cloud the outlook and the BOC is "much more preoccupied" with downside inflation risks. Even if commodity prices remain relatively strong, Mr. Rosenberg advises clients to sell into strength as he expects the Canadian dollar to be trading in the C$1.30 to C$1.35 range relative to USD.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Paul Vieira\par \par \uc2 THURSDAY\par \par \uc2 8 a.m. EDT | 1200 GMT\par \par \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  releases policy statement, minutes and inflation report\par \par \uc2 8 a.m. ET | 1200 GMT\par \par \uc2 Czech National Bank\uc2  releases policy statement\par \par \uc2 8:30 a.m. EDT | 1230 GMT\par \par \uc2 Fed's Powell speaks\par \par \uc2 12:20 p.m. EDT | 1620 GMT\par \par \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  's Dudley speaks\par \par \uc2 6:15 p.m. EDT | 2215 GMT\par \par \uc2 Atlanta Fed\uc2  's Bostic speaks\par \par \uc2 Worker Churn and Employment Growth at the Establishment Level\par \par \uc2 Many companies both hire and lay off within a short time window, resulting in "churn," and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://voxeu.org/article/worker-churn-and-employment-growth-establishment-level"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 new findings }}}\uc2  from R\u252\'00\'FCdiger Bachmann, Christian Bayer, Christian Merkl, Stefan Seth, Heiko St\u252\'00\'FCber and Felix Wellschmied show the rate of churn in Germany is high and can be up to 40% greater in booms compared with recessions.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Global professional services company \uc2 Ernst & Young LLP\uc2  is heading to Manhattan's far West Side.\par \par \uc2 The company said it plans to move its U.S. headquarters from 5 Times Square to One Manhattan West, where it has signed a lease to take 600,000 square feet on 17 floors.\par \par \uc2 EY, which has been expanding its presence in the metropolitan area, is part of a wave of big tenants, including \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 ., that have committed to taking office space at the eight-acre development where One Manhattan West is now rising.\par \par \uc2 The company liked Manhattan West's location near Penn Station and subway lines as well as the modern construction and building systems offered by the eight-acre Manhattan West complex and the 2.1 million square-foot office tower where it will reside, said Richard Jeanneret, vice chair and northeast managing partner at the company.\par \par \uc2 Another important component, he said: the tax incentive package New York state is offering. The state will provide EY with up to $12 million in tax credits if it creates 1,152 jobs in New York City over the next seven years. The company has about 10,000 employees in the New York metropolitan area.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of the day, with our analysis of space needs and costs to lease that space, the incentives helped us to keep the concentration we planned to have in the city," said Mr. Jeanneret.\par \par \uc2 In September, the state announced a $20 million tax-credit package for \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2  to add more than 2,000 jobs over 10 years in New York City. Amazon signed a 15-year lease for about 360,000 square feet at Five Manhattan West.\par \par \uc2 "Our investments to attract and retain the world's leading companies are creating high-paying jobs and leveraging new investment to help strengthen and grow our economy," said \uc2 Gov.

He is set to lay out his ideas in a speech Thursday evening at a financial regulation conference hosted by the conservative Mercatus Center.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Quintenz will take aim at the CFTC's swap dealer threshold as an example of what he calls a burdensome and ineffective form of rulemaking, according to a draft of his remarks reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 Firms with annual swaps transactions worth more than $8 billion in notional value currently must register with the CFTC as swap dealers, but the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act mandated the limit to be lowered to $3 billion. The CFTC has twice delayed lowering the threshold, most recently last month. Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo has vowed to come up with a permanent fix in the coming months.\par \par \uc2 Many end users, such as energy and agricultural firms, worry that a lower threshold would saddle market participants that don't pose a systemic risk with unreasonable compliance costs, and would discourage legitimate hedging activities.\par \par \uc2 Part of the fix, Mr. Quintenz argues, should include changing the methodology for how market activity is measured. Notional value, he plans to say, "is an incredibly poor measure of activity and an almost meaningless measure of risk." One possibility for an alternative measurement, he suggests, would be to "combine notional value with the number of a firm's swap dealing transactions and counterparties."\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Trump to Tap Jerome Powell as Next Fed Chairman on Thursday\par \par \uc2 By Kate Davidson, Peter Nicholas and David Harrison\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The White House has notified Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell that President Donald Trump intends to nominate him as the next chairman of the central bank, according to a person familiar with the matter, a move likely to combine continuity on interest-rate policy with perhaps a lighter touch on financial regulation.\par \par \uc2 If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Powell would succeed Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, the central bank's first female leader, whose four-year term as Fed chief expires in early February.\par \par \uc2 In his five years at the Fed, Mr. Powell has been a reliable ally of Ms. Yellen and would likely continue the Fed's current cautious approach to reversing the central bank's crisis-era stimulus policies as the economy expands.\par \par \uc2 That would mean gradually raising short-term interest rates in quarter-percentage-point steps through 2020 while slowly shrinking the Fed's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities it purchased to lower long-term rates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell's nomination would mark the first time in nearly four decades that a new president hasn't asked the serving Fed leader to stay on for another term, even though that person was nominated by a president of a different party. The last time a first-term president didn't do that was in 1978, when President Jimmy Carter chose G. William Miller to succeed Arthur Burns.\par \par \uc2 The president spoke with Mr. Powell on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter who couldn't describe what they discussed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump had settled on Mr. Powell by Saturday, but people familiar with the process had cautioned that he could change his mind. The president plans to formally announce the decision Thursday before he leaves for a trip to Asia on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Reached by phone Wednesday, both Mr. Powell and Ms. Yellen declined to comment. A Fed spokeswoman also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen was one of five finalists for the position, along with Stanford University economics professor John Taylor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh didn't respond to requests seeking comment Wednesday. Mr. Cohn's spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said in a video last week that he had "somebody very specific in mind" for the job. "It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job," Mr. Trump said in a video posted to \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , adding, "I think everybody will be very impressed."\par \par \uc2 Fed officials began raising their benchmark federal-funds rate in December 2015 after holding it near zero for seven years following the financial crisis. They voted in June to lift rates to a range between 1% and 1.25% and in October started the process of slowly shrinking the Fed's bond portfolio.\par \par \uc2 "The economy is as close to our assigned goals as it has been for many years," Mr. Powell said in June. If it continues growing as expected, "I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates."\par \par \uc2 Officials have penciled in one more rate increase this year. But they indicated in September such increases are likely to end at a lower point than they had previously projected\u8212\'20\'14at a longer-run level of around 2.75%\u8212\'20\'14considerably lower than where officials have stopped raising rates in the past.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in July, "I'd like to see rates stay low."\par \par \uc2 The Fed on Wednesday left short-term interest rates unchanged, but signaled it would consider lifting them before year's end amid signs the economy is gaining momentum.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell has never dissented on a Fed monetary or regulatory policy vote and in speeches hasn't deviated far from the board's consensus.\par \par \uc2 Where he could lead a shift is on regulatory policy. He has advocated loosening some of the financial rules adopted by the Fed and other agencies since the crisis, a position that meshes with Mr. Trump's deregulatory agenda. Mr. Powell has suggested softening the Volcker rule barring banks from using their own money to make risky bets and easing some bank stress tests.\par \par \uc2 He also has endorsed reviewing some of the supervisory duties imposed on banks' boards of directors to prevent them from being burdened with "an ever-increasing checklist."\par \par \uc2 "More regulation is not the best answer to every problem," Mr. Powell said in a speech in early October.\par \par \uc2 "To some extent he offers Trump the best of both worlds. You get broadly speaking continuity of Yellen's careful and relatively dovish approach to monetary policy but with somebody who is a card-carrying Republican and who is significantly more inclined to revisit some of the postcrisis regulations," said \uc2 Krishna Guha\uc2 , vice chairman at Evercore ISI and a former \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  official.\par \par \uc2 Karen Petrou, managing partner of the financial-services consulting firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said Mr. Powell's recent remarks on regulation "were certainly much more flexible than [Ms. Yellen] has been."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell, a lawyer, would be the first Fed leader in three decades without a Ph.D. in economics. Before joining the Fed board, Mr. Powell worked as an investment banker in New York City, as Treasury undersecretary for financial institutions in the George H.W. Bush administration, as a partner at the \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2  and as a scholar at the \uc2 Bipartisan Policy Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That background could serve him well, said Aaron Klein, an economic studies fellow at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  and director of the Center on Regulation and Markets.\par \par \uc2 "The Federal Reserve's mandate has grown significantly since the financial crisis," he said. "With a broader mandate, one should expect broader and more diverse backgrounds of potential good fits for a chair."\par \par \uc2 "He would represent continuity of the Fed system and culture but a break from the predominance of monetary policy as the core background of the chair," Mr. Klein said.\par \par \uc2 The decision marks the culmination of an unusually public and drawn-out search for one of the top economic policy-making jobs in the world.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump upended the usually staid selection process by openly weighing the pros and cons of various candidates and asking lawmakers, businesspeople and media personalities for their input.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump polled GOP senators last month on their preferred choice at a lunch on Capitol Hill, and said he was still considering "two, and maybe three" people for the job.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has other opportunities to reshape the central bank. Randal Quarles, his first nominee to the Fed's powerful seven-member board of governors, took office in October. Three other seats remain open.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen's term as a Fed governor doesn't expire until 2024, and she hasn't ruled out staying on in that position after her term as chairwoman ends. The decision would be unusual, but not unprecedented. Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles remained a governor for three years after not being reappointed to the top job by President Harry Truman.\par \par \uc2 Nominations for all board positions, including chairman and vice chairman, are subject to Senate confirmation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell should have little trouble winning Senate approval, but his views could clash with those of some Republican senators who have criticized him for supporting the Fed's easy-money and postcrisis regulatory policies.\par \par \uc2 He won confirmation to the Fed with bipartisan support in the Senate twice before: to fill an unfinished governor's term in 2012 and for a full term in 2014. Some Republicans have suggested he could face difficult questions from his own side of the aisle. "I think we should move in a different direction," from current Fed policies, Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said last month about the possibility of a Powell nomination.\par \par \uc2 New Workplace Perk: Loans for Low-Income Employees\par \par \uc2 By Yuka Hayashi\par \par \uc2 More U.S. employers are teaming up with financial institutions such as credit unions to offer small personal loans to their workers, offering employees a way to bridge financial crunches without turning to high-cost payday loans.\par \par \uc2 Lower-income workers' pay is stagnating, propping up demand for small consumer loans. A Federal Reserve survey last year found 44% of Americans had difficulty covering an emergency expense of $400. Many low-income workers lack credit history and access to credit cards or bank loans.\par \par \uc2 A new federal regulation cracking down on payday lenders is likely to create further needs for alternative forms of credit, but it remains unclear who can fill the gap.\par \par \uc2 No formal statistics exist to show how many employers offer such programs, but several community-based networks with participating local employers have emerged across the country in recent years. A program in Savannah, Georgia, for example, was started in 2015 and one in Geauga County, Ohio, in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Rhino Foods Inc\uc2 ., a Burlington, Vt., company that makes ice-cream ingredients, teamed up with a local credit union to provide same-day loans of as much as $1,000 with no credit checks and no questions asked to any employee that has worked at the company for at least a year. The loans' current annual interest rate is 16.99%, a fraction of the rates for payday credit\u8212\'20\'14small consumer loans used by millions of Americans each year\u8212\'20\'14which can climb to 400%.\par \par \uc2 "If you could help an employee whose car breaks down or water heater is broken, you are going to have an employee come to work in better shape," said Ted Castle, chief executive of Rhino, which has 140 employees. Ms. Castle said the loan program helped the company boost its employee retention rate.\par \par \uc2 Rhino employee Justin Charron, a 32-year-old line operator, recently used the program to buy a car, which allowed him to end his daily two-mile walk to work. He took an earlier loan to pay an unexpectedly large heating bill in 2015. The company's HR department arranged for a loan with the local lender, NorthCountry Federal Credit Union. By the end of the day, he had a $1,000 loan, which he paid off within several months through weekly payroll deductions of $50.\par \par \uc2 "Life happens. I know it really helped to keep me on track," said Mr. Charron.\par \par \uc2 Employer-sponsored loans aren't a big moneymaker but nonprofit financial institutions, including credit unions, have recently found ways to make them work. They keep costs low by skipping underwriting, with the company essentially vouching for an employee's ability to repay the loan. Automated payroll deductions mean repayment rates are high. The biggest challenge occurs when the worker leaves the employer.\par \par \uc2 Finra Investor Education Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the \uc2 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\uc2 , a private regulator, recently completed an 18-month market test of an employer-sponsored loan program that included 13 financial institutions and 48 employers. The Finra foundation, along with the nonprofit Filene Research Institute, will soon start offering free resources to help companies and financial institutions launch such efforts. "This has the potential to really make a difference in the short-term liquidity needs of lower-income workers," said Gerri Walsh, the Finra foundation's president.\par \par \uc2 While the companies' HR departments process payroll deductions, loans are kept confidential from the borrowers' managers and company officials. Unlike payday loans, employer-based loans help the borrowers build credit history. Some programs also encourage employees to build rainy-day funds by continuing payroll deductions even after the loans are paid off.\par \par \uc2 "Part of what credit unions are founded to do is to provide small loans to people of limited means," said Jeff Smith, NorthCountry's director of credit administration, which works with over 30 employers in Vermont with a combined 4,700 employees. "We are breaking even with this program. It certainly achieves part of what we are founded to do."\par \par \uc2 Texas-based Rio Grande Valley Multibank Corp., a community lender set up by several large banks as part of their lower-income lending efforts, started offering employer-based small-dollar loans in 2011 and now operates through its subsidiary in four states. It works with local nonprofit lenders as a franchiser covering 150 employers with 74,000 workers\u8212\'20\'14ranging from a hair salon with three workers to the Houston municipal government, with over 20,000 employees.\par \par \uc2 Nick Mitchell-Bennett, Rio Grande Valley's executive director, said the biggest challenge was figuring out the right mix of employers to minimize the default rate while serving as many lower-income borrowers as possible. In 2013, Rio Grande Valley's default rate surged to an unsustainable level of 13% after one large employer, a demolisher of ships, laid off many workers, who then stopped repayments. The group now keeps its rate of loan write-offs below 4% by working with a number of public-sector employers with fewer layoffs, as well as private companies.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody had done this before," he said. "There was no instruction manual for us to do it."\par \par \uc2 This year, the group is on track to make 13,000 loans, more than double the number in 2015, for a total sum of roughly $10 million. Within three to five years, it wants to offer 50,000 loans annually by recruiting more local Community Development Financial Institutions, which raise low-cost funds from the federal government and banks as part of their community lending programs.\par \par \uc2 SEC Warns Celebrities Against Endorsing Stock and Coin Offerings\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Celebrities who pitch investors on stock sales and initial coin offerings without disclosing their pay may be breaking the law, a top U.S. markets regulator said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 In a forceful statement, the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  said celebrities who endorse such deals may be violating laws originally written to prevent publishers from hyping stocks without disclosing they were paid to tout them. The misconduct also could violate antifraud laws that the SEC enforces, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 The SEC said it issued the warning after seeing celebrities endorse initial coin offerings, a new fundraising method used by startups focused on blockchain and digital currencies.\par \par \uc2 Celebrities have also been used to boost interest in "mini-IPOs," a new capital-raising method approved by the SEC in 2015. Smaller firms have used the regulatory exemption, also known as Regulation A+, to raise as much as $50 million without as much disclosure to investors.\par \par \uc2 Any celebrity or other person who promotes a stock or coin offering "must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion," the SEC's enforcement division and its office of examinations wrote in a public statement. "A failure to disclose this information is a violation of the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws."\par \par \uc2 The SEC on Wednesday also issued an investor alert intended to educate retail investors who might be swayed by celebrity endorsements.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, the SEC cracked down on stock touts who wrote articles in online publications without disclosing they were paid to hype a stock. The sweep targeted 27 people and companies involved in what the SEC said was "nothing more than paid advertisements."\par \par \uc2 More Women, Nonwhite Men Enter the Boardroom\par \par \uc2 By Joann S. Lublin\par \par \uc2 White men are starting to lose their boardroom dominance at the biggest U.S. businesses.\par \par \uc2 Women and minorities account for half of the 397 newest independent directors at S&P 500 companies, according to an analysis of 2017 proxy statements by \uc2 Spencer Stuart\uc2 , an executive recruitment firm. That is the highest level since the firm began tracking the data in 1998.\par \par \uc2 The shift partly reflects shareholder pressure. Institutional investors "keep raising the issue of board diversity,'' said \uc2 Julie Hembrock Daum\uc2 , head of \uc2 Spencer Stuart\uc2 's North American board practice.\par \par \uc2 For instance, giant money manager State Street Global Advisors voted this year against the reelection of certain directors at about 400 companies that it said failed to address gender diversity in a meaningful way.\par \par \uc2 And the business environment is changing so fast that boards increasingly "recognize the need to add directors with experience in emerging areas critical to the company's future success,'' Ms. Daum added.\par \par \uc2 Spencer Stuart\uc2  found other signs of boards' greater willingness to enlarge their membership pool. A record 45% of the new S&P 500 directors lacked experience on a public company board. Fewer than half of these board novices are female, the analysis showed.\par \par \uc2 In seeking independent directors, companies have long favored current chief executives, who typically are white men. But fewer business bosses have time for outside board service.\par \par \uc2 The percentage of S&P 500 CEOs with at least one external director role hit a record low of 37% this year, \uc2 Spencer Stuart\uc2  found. That's down from 52% a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 Despite the expanded ranks of new female and nonwhite directors, the proportion of women on S&P 500 boards only rose slightly to 22% from 21% in 2016. \uc2 Spencer Stuart\uc2  blamed modest director turnover.\par \par \uc2 In another first, more than half of S&P 500 companies now have split the roles of chairman and CEO, the search firm said.\par \par \uc2 SEC Letter to Guggenheim Questions Disclosure of African Banking Investment\par \par \uc2 By Justin Baer and Margot Patrick\par \par \uc2 Guggenheim Partners LLC\uc2  received a July letter from U.S. regulators that raised concerns about its relationship with companies connected to former Barclays PLC Chief Executive \uc2 Bob Diamond\uc2 , people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 The letter from the \uc2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  informed Guggenheim that an examination found issues with the way the company disclosed an investment in \uc2 Atlas Mara Ltd\uc2 ., the African banking venture co-founded by Mr. Diamond, the people said. Mr. Diamond is currently \uc2 Atlas Mara\uc2 's executive chairman and a 2% shareholder, according to filings.\par \par \uc2 Guggenheim, an investment firm, bought \uc2 Atlas Mara\uc2  shares and bonds on behalf of some of its funds and investment-management clients. It advised two of those clients, which are both insurance companies owned by a Guggenheim shareholder, to invest in Mr. Diamond's separate private-equity business, \uc2 Atlas Merchant Capital LLC\uc2 , and arranged the investments on their behalf, according to filings and people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The SEC questioned why Guggenheim didn't deem \uc2 Atlas Mara\uc2  an affiliate, said people familiar with the letter.\par \par \uc2 The company's investment-adviser unit, Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, is a 7.87% shareholder in \uc2 Atlas Mara\uc2 , according to a September filing by Guggenheim.\par \par \uc2 Federal securities laws place limitations on SEC-registered investment companies doing business with affiliates, defined as being at least 5% owned by the investment company. There are also disclosure requirements around stock and bond sales involving related parties. The laws were put in place in response to widespread self-dealing by investment firms in the 1920s. They are meant to guard against transactions with affiliates that might disadvantage other clients.\par \par \uc2 Through a spokesman, \uc2 Atlas Mara\uc2 , Atlas Merchant and Mr. Diamond declined to comment. The companies and Mr. Diamond haven't been accused of any wrongdoing. The focus of the SEC examination is Guggenheim, the people said. There is no indication Mr. Diamond is part of any SEC review.\par \par \uc2 The July letter, which hasn't previously been reported, is part of the SEC's renewed scrutiny of Guggenheim, a privately held firm that manages more than $295 billion for insurance companies, pension funds, retirees and other investors.\par \par \uc2 Guggenheim is also dealing with employee departures in the firm's investment business and internal unrest surrounding the status of a key executive and the purchase of two multimillion-dollar homes in southern California, according to current and former employees, clients and other people familiar with the company. Guggenheim has said its business isn't in turmoil and that the firm is experiencing strong investment performance and record asset growth. It has also said it is grateful for the continuing loyalty of its clients.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal reported in September that the SEC was looking at certain transactions by Guggenheim, including those with Mr. Diamond's companies. Concerns over whether Guggenheim had properly disclosed the investments in companies tied to Mr. Diamond were brought to the regulator's attention by a former employee, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Guggenheim officials have explained to the SEC why they handled the transactions the way they did, and are awaiting a reply from the SEC, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 In September, Guggenheim Chief Investment Officer \uc2 Scott Minerd\uc2  told CNBC that the SEC had initiated an examination of Guggenheim and said the firm was cooperating.\par \par \uc2 The regulator's examiners have discussed the information with the agency's enforcement staff, the Journal reported in September. Guggenheim hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing, and it is unclear if the enforcement unit will pursue an investigation into the Atlas dealings.\par \par \uc2 Two years ago, Guggenheim settled SEC claims it had failed to disclose a conflict of interest involving a loan that one of its executives took from a client. That agreement required Guggenheim, which didn't admit or deny wrongdoing, to hire an independent compliance consultant to appraise its policies for dealing with conflicts.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, the SEC began asking a new set of questions about the relationship between the firm and Mr. Diamond's companies, according to people close to the company.\par \par \uc2 Guggenheim first bought shares in \uc2 Atlas Mara\uc2  on behalf of investment management clients in December 2013 when the company raised $325 million on the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2 , according to filings. Some Guggenheim funds later bought convertible bonds issued by \uc2 Atlas Mara\uc2 , according to fund filings.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Minerd, Guggenheim's chief investment officer, previously worked for Mr. Diamond in the 1990s at Credit Suisse First Boston.\par \par \uc2 In 2014 and 2015, \uc2 Guggenheim Partners\uc2  lined up investments for two insurance clients into \uc2 Atlas Merchant Capital\uc2 's management company and its maiden fund. The insurers committed more than $200 million, according to filings and people familiar with the matter. These insurers are owned by \uc2 Sammons Enterprises Inc\uc2 ., a roughly 35% shareholder of \uc2 Guggenheim Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Atlas Merchant Capital\uc2  has reported in filings to the SEC that substantially all of its initial capital came from U.S. insurance companies.\par \par \uc2 A Sammons spokesman said he couldn't immediately comment.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Senate Panel Advances SEC Nominees\par \par \uc2 The Senate Banking Committee advanced two nominees to posts at the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , somewhat easing a logjam that has hampered the short-handed markets regulator. The panel approved Robert Jackson, a Democrat, and \uc2 Hester Peirce\uc2 , a Republican, unanimously by voice vote. The SEC is currently operating with just three members, two fewer than its full complement. They are \uc2 Kara Stein\uc2 , a Democrat; Michael Piwowar, a Republican; and Jay Clayton, the independent chairman. Wednesday's vote paves the way for the full Senate to confirm the pair later this year.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: House Passes Deregulatory Measures Aimed at Boosting Startups\par \par \uc2 The House acted in a rare display of bipartisanship Wednesday to unanimously pass a pair of bills aimed at making it easier for smaller companies to grow and create jobs, the latest in a series of modest deregulatory measures to clear the chamber. One bill, sponsored by Rep. David Schweikert (R., Ariz.), would ease \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  restrictions that lock out investors with only moderate wealth from buying stakes in privately held startups. Another bill introduced by Reps. Ted Budd (R., N.C.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) would allow all companies to file paperwork confidentially with the SEC as a first step toward going public. Until now, that privilege has only been available to firms with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. Both measures face an uncertain path in the Senate, but they could help prod the SEC to alter its regulations to make such changes permanent.\par \par \uc2 Trump Signs Bill Scrapping Arbitration Rule\par \par \uc2 By Yuka Hayashi\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a bill repealing a regulation designed to make it easier for consumers to sue banks, handing the financial industry one of the biggest victories of his term.\par \par \uc2 The move dealt a blow to the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 , an agency run by an Obama appointee that until now had pressed ahead with its tough regulatory agenda despite pushback from Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's action scuttled the so-called arbitration rule rolled out by the CFPB in July. It aimed to allow consumers to bring class-action lawsuits to resolve disputes with banks by barring mandatory arbitration agreements included in the fine print of contracts for credit cards and other financial products. Fearing higher legal defense costs, banks had fought hard to thwart the rule.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans narrowly voted to strike down the rule last week, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tiebreaking vote. The House voted in July to kill the rule.\par \par \uc2 Even after the Senate vote, the CFPB and its supporters tried to salvage the rule. CFPB Director \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2  wrote a letter to Mr. Trump on Monday, appealing to him to veto the bill. "You alone now have the power to safeguard people's ability to take action together and go to court when they are wronged," Mr. Cordray wrote.\par \par \uc2 "This action tips the scales of justice in favor of Wall Street banks less than ten years after they caused the financial crisis," Mr. Cordray said in a statement Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump signed the bill surrounded by representatives of the financial industry, including heads of trade groups such as the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2 , the \uc2 Consumer Bankers Association\uc2  and the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Thankfully, we now have a Congress and a president who understand that more complicated and excessive regulations are the last thing our economy needs," said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a leading critic of the CFPB.\par \par \uc2 Financial executives have praised the rule's demise, after growing frustrated with the slow pace of legislative actions to roll back financial regulations. In the latest development to worry the industry, the two top members of the Senate banking panel this week ended months of negotiations over legislation to ease the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law.\par \par \uc2 To overturn the arbitration rule, lawmakers turned to a legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to kill newly issued rules\u8212\'20\'14the 14th time Republicans used the law to kill Obama-era regulations this year. Trump administration officials had encouraged GOP lawmakers' efforts, with the Treasury Department and the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  issuing reports saying the rule would raise costs for banks and hurt consumers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cordray is serving a term that runs till July 2018 but some think he might leave sooner to run for governor of Ohio. His departure will give Mr. Trump a chance to install a new leader and overhaul the agency that has been mired in partisan disagreements since it was founded after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers Remain Cool to Trump Pick for Export-Import Bank\par \par \uc2 By Andrew Ackerman\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14President Donald Trump's choice to head the Export-Import Bank didn't appear to sway waffling Republican senators on a key panel into supporting him, putting his confirmation at risk.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers from both parties criticized Scott Garrett during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday, saying his past votes to shut down the bank while serving in the House made him unsuitable to run the agency.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett reversed his prior opposition to the agency in testimony before the committee, pledging to keep the bank "fully functioning." But lawmakers indicated they weren't satisfied by his remarks.\par \par \uc2 No Democrats on the committee are expected to back Mr. Garrett, meaning attracting enough Republican support is crucial to getting his nomination through the panel and advancing it to the full Senate. Industry groups that benefit from the Ex-Im Bank, which provides financing for U.S. exports, are pressuring lawmakers to oppose Mr. Garrett.\par \par \uc2 "What would have made you change your mind about whether or not the Export-Import Bank should exist?" asked Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) who said he had met with Mr. Garrett twice and hadn't received a satisfactory answer. "This is critical, that you be able to share what has changed your mind."\par \par \uc2 Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the banking panel's top Democrat, said that to confirm Mr. Garrett "would be like putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department." Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) wondered if Mr. Garrett was being sent to the bank as a "saboteur."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett, a New Jersey Republican who served seven terms in the House before losing last November, faced potential opposition from at least two Republicans on the banking panel: Mr. Rounds and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Republicans hold just one more seat than Democrats on the panel.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scott bantered with Mr. Garrett during the hearing but later told reporters he was still undecided.\par \par \uc2 Pressed by Mr. Brown and other lawmakers on why he wanted to head the bank, or if he was retracting his prior calls to shut down the bank, Mr. Garrett said that his earlier remarks were a matter of public record and that, if confirmed, he would keep the agency "fully functional."\par \par \uc2 "I do commit to carrying out the letter of the law as established by Congress because I was frustrated when that law was not being followed by the previous administration," he said at one point.\par \par \uc2 Some of the panel's Republicans defended Mr. Garrett. Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said the bank was too dedicated to helping large U.S. corporations and needed "reform" because it is "now rampant with corporate cronyism, corruption and unaccountability"\u8212\'20\'14remarks that echo Mr. Garrett's earlier positions. And Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey said he would try to block the confirmations of five additional, noncontroversial nominees for openings at the bank if the Senate fails to confirm Mr. Garrett to the top post.\par \par \uc2 The former lawmaker isn't the first of Mr. Trump's nominees to shift his stance or be appointed to an agency whose existence he had opposed. Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, has urged lawmakers to keep the government funded and raise its borrowing limit, after voting against both in the House. Energy Secretary \uc2 Rick Perry\uc2  called for eliminating the agency before he ran it, while \uc2 Scott Pruitt\uc2  was a sharp critic of the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  before Mr. Trump tapped him to lead it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump opposed the Ex-Im Bank at times during the 2016 presidential campaign, but said in an April interview with The Wall Street Journal that he would support it.\par \par \uc2 The Ex-Im Bank helps support U.S. exports through a range of programs, including guaranteeing loans to foreign buyers and providing credit insurance. Its charter ran out in July 2015, preventing it from conducting new business until it was renewed in December 2015 and authorized until September 2019. However, Senate Republicans haven't filled empty board seats, depriving the Ex-Im Bank for the past two years of a quorum and leaving it unable to approve financing for deals of more than $10 million.\par \par \uc2 The bank says the lack of a quorum has led to a buildup of unapproved deals. More than $30 billion in transactions are in the pipeline, according to a bank spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett is widely opposed by many in the business community, which favors renewal of the bank's charter. That has opened a rare fissure between Capitol Hill Republicans and their allies on K Street.\par \par \uc2 The National Association of Manufacturers and the Aerospace Industries Association have been among the most vocal opponents of the nominee.\par \par \uc2 The Ex-Im Bank's critics view the agency as "corporate welfare" and an inappropriate interference with the market economy. Some GOP lawmakers and Democrats say the agency is necessary to keep U.S. companies competitive against foreign firms that receive similar help from their governments.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett voted against legislation reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank in 2012 and again in 2015. In an October 2015 speech, Mr. Garrett called the bank "taxpayer-funded welfare for mega corporations" and the embodiment of "the corruption of the free enterprise system."\par \par \uc2 One lobbyist for a Fortune 100 manufacturing company said the Garrett nomination had put the business community in "an impossible position." While they want to maintain a good relationship with the White House, they see Mr. Garrett as an unacceptable choice, the lobbyist said.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin Futures May Be Coming, But a Bitcoin ETF Is No Lock\par \par \uc2 By Paul Vigna\par \par \uc2 CME Group\uc2  's decision to create a bitcoin-futures contract could pave the way for a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund, but it is no sure thing.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, the operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other futures markets announced plans to launch a contract based on bitcoin by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.\par \par \uc2 It would be a significant development for the digital currency, for the first time giving Wall Street traders a straightforward way to bet on bitcoin's price, both up and down. Futures also offer a way for market participants to protect themselves against the currency's notorious price swings.\par \par \uc2 Some say a vibrant futures market in bitcoin could also open up a new path for the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  to approve a bitcoin-based ETF, and some ETF players have looked at basing their product off a bitcoin futures contract.\par \par \uc2 "This definitely is a positive development," said Dimitri Nemirovsky, a founder at SolidX Management LLC, which had proposed one of the bitcoin ETFs that the SEC rejected earlier this year. "A bitcoin futures contract listed on a major exchange like CME directly addresses one of the concerns the SEC staff identified in their disapproval notice for our fund."\par \par \uc2 Still, the existence of a futures contract alone likely wouldn't be enough for the commission to change its mind. The wording of the SEC decision referred to "well-established, significant, regulated markets." That suggests that the SEC would require not just the existence of a futures contract, but enough trading history for it to constitute a liquid, transparent market.\par \par \uc2 Unlike commodities that have become the basis for popular futures contracts and ETFs, bitcoin is only eight years old. The digital currency created by an anonymous founder isn't backed by any sovereign nation, but exists on a network of interconnected computers. Its central feature is an open ledger of transactions that results in a public record that can't be altered.\par \par \uc2 Since its launch in 2009, bitcoin has been a source of both controversy and viral growth, associated with both illicit dark-web activities like ransomware and money laundering, as well as the Silicon Valley startup scene.\par \par \uc2 In March, the SEC rejected two of the proposed ETFs, one from the brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and a second from SolidX.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's main objection was that bitcoin trading was too opaque and that market manipulation would be undetectable. The commission was concerned that most bitcoin trading was done on unregulated exchanges outside the U.S. Because of that, the U.S. exchanges that would have listed and traded the bitcoin ETFs\u8212\'20\'14the New York Stock Exchange for SolidX and the renamed Cboe BZX U.S. Equities Exchange for the \uc2 Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14wouldn't be able to enter into surveillance-sharing agreements that would allow them to guard against market manipulation.\par \par \uc2 The commission wrote in its rejection of the SolidX proposal in March that for previously approved ETFs "there have been in every case well-established, significant, regulated markets for trading futures on the underlying commodity."\par \par \uc2 In its announcement Tuesday, CME essentially said it is comfortable dealing with bitcoin exchanges that the SEC largely is nervous about. Its futures contract will be based on pricing data from four existing bitcoin exchanges, \uc2 Bitstamp\uc2 , GDAX, itBit and Kraken.\par \par \uc2 The SEC on Wednesday declined to comment. The Winklevoss brothers were unavailable to comment.\par \par \uc2 A third ETF, the \uc2 Bitcoin Investment Trust\uc2  from Grayscale Investments, trades as an over-the-counter product. The firm had applied to have it listed as a fully regulated ETF, but withdrew that application in October before the Commission ruled on it. Grayscale declined to comment on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bitcoin Investment Trust\uc2  has risen sharply this year as the price of bitcoin has surged. Recently at $828 per share, it is up 581% this year. Bitcoin traded as high as $6,629 on Wednesday, another record high. It is up roughly 580% this year.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Brexit to Hit 10,000 British Finance Jobs, Regulator Says\par \par \uc2 By Max Colchester\par \par \uc2 LONDON\u8212\'20\'14A top \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  official Wednesday said he expected up to 10,000 jobs to leave the U.K.'s financial sector by the time Britain exits the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The British finance regulator asked banks and insurers to detail their plans if Brexit happens without a transition deal in 2019. The answers they got showed that thousands of jobs would leave, says \uc2 Sam Woods\uc2 , head of the U.K.'s Prudential Regulatory Authority. The regulator is preparing for companies to begin shifting roles out of Britain early next year.\par \par \uc2 A move of 10,000 jobs would account for around 2% to 3% of financial-services employment in City of London, Mr. Woods added. "The big question is not where we are going to get to on day one," he said. "Which path are we set on in the longer term?"\par \par \uc2 So far, the Brexit negotiations have given little clarity to the City of London's vast financial center. Executives at big banks are hoping that there will be a breakthrough in negotiations at a key EU summit in December that could elucidate a transition deal. Such an arrangement would effectively delay Brexit and give the financial sector several years to adjust its business models.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Woods warned that the banks' Brexit contingency plans would probably start to be put into operation in the first quarter of next year if the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  failed to secure a transition deal.\par \par \uc2 Currently, banks have "passports" that allow them to sell products to EU clients. After Brexit, that right will likely no longer exist. Most major banks have already scoped out where they will create EU hubs to house their European business after Brexit. Several have started applications for licenses. \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . have even made investment in extra office space in Frankfurt and Dublin respectively.\par \par \uc2 Most of the banks are focused around moves to Germany, Ireland and France, said Mr. Woods. However, any shift will be gradual. The key question for London's future financial dominance is not so much how many jobs remain in the U.K. but whether it maintains its role as a hub with a deep liquid market.\par \par \uc2 At least in the beginning, regulators including \uc2 Germany's BaFin\uc2  have said they will accept banks' flipping risk from their EU entities back into their London hubs.\par \par \uc2 The German regulator will also initially allow banks to use the same risk modeling that was approved by the \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 , BaFin President \uc2 Felix Hufeld\uc2  said recently. That could help keep capital, and jobs, in London initially. But bankers expect European regulators to gradually ramp up requirements, forcing banks to move more capital and roles into their EU entities over time.\par \par \uc2 Predicting the impact of Brexit on banks, however, is proving particularly difficult. The U.K. regulator's request for contingency plans showed a huge divergence among banks about how they see Brexit play out and what its impact could be, according to bankers.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bank of England\uc2 , for instance, is worried about how $20 trillion of uncleared derivatives contracts between EU and U.K. banks would fare without a Brexit agreement. The central bank worries that without regulatory permission it could be illegal to exercise options on existing contracts after Brexit.

Index products secured a record 11.3% of total options volume in the first nine months of this year, and options trading on exchange-traded funds remained dominant. In contrast, single-stock option activity is near its record low levels, having dwindled since 2006. Options trading on the S&P 500 and VIX indexes rose.

Hargreaves Lansdown notes that regulatory tightening is increasing the capital Standard must keep in reserve, while ongoing costs of extra regulatory hurdles are rising.

Private investors including Alibaba\u8217\'20\'19s payments affiliate \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2  also participated.\par \par \uc2 Face++, which had a valuation of Rmb10bn ($1.5bn) before its recent round of investment, declined to reveal its post-fundraising valuation.\par \par \uc2 The company is benefiting from a plan laid out this year by \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s State Council\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0to become the world\u8217\'20\'19s unchallenged leader in AI research and applications by 2030, and a subsequent push by government-run venture capital funds to support domestic start-ups.\par \par \uc2 According to \uc2 KPMG\uc2 , the government has invested more than $1bn to date in early-stage funding for young start-ups.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CInvestment from the \u8216\'20\'18national team\u8217\'20\'19 [state-owned funds] means Face++ will receive much more policy support from the government, which will greatly benefit their development,\u8221\'20\'1D said Leng Biao, professor of body recognition at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut there are risks too, because national-team funding comes with restrictions on who can invest in them in future.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Face++ is pioneering technologies that are used by mobile payments company \uc2 Ant Financial\uc2 , which\u160\'00\'A0is trialling its software to let customers pay with scanning their face. It is talking to banks about the use of its software in their branches.\par \par \uc2 Last week, the Chinese start-up beat teams from \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  in tests of image recognition at the International Conference on Computer Vision in Italy, the industry\u8217\'20\'19s major worldwide gathering.\par \par \uc2 But Face++ also is helping China\u8217\'20\'19s police automatically track the country\u8217\'20\'19s 1.3bn citizens and identify them in\u160\'00\'A0surveillance footage. \u8220\'20\'1CWe want to build the eyes and brain of the city, to help police analyse vehicles and people to an extent beyond what is humanly possible,\u8221\'20\'1D the company said.\par \par \uc2 The use of AI\u160\'00\'A0allows police to trace a target across multiple cameras in different locations. The government aims to be able to predict crimes before they happen by analysing patterns of movement.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEvery prefecture\u8217\'20\'19s municipal police department [of which China has 294] has invested at least Rmb100m each into their facial-recognition surveillance systems,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Leng added.\par \par \uc2 Unlike fingerprinting or retinal scans, facial recognition software can analyse targets without their knowledge.\par \par \uc2 Since AI technologies require data to learn from, Face++ benefits from training its algorithms on China\u8217\'20\'19s vast pool of cheaply available data \u8212\'20\'14 and from more relaxed privacy laws on the mainland.\par \par \uc2 Its software can recognise people without them having given the company any information, since it links up to China\u8217\'20\'19s national photo identification database of more than 1bn records \u8212\'20\'14 the largest in the world.\par \par \uc2 Face++ opened its first overseas lab in Seattle in July, and poached Wang Jue, a principal scientist at Adobe, to head it. The company says it hopes to expand globally in future.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Yingzhi Yang\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171101edb1003h1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

He will begin on November 13 and replace Frank Desmond, who is leaving TP \uc2 ICAP\uc2  after 12 years.\par \par \uc2 Mr Sinclair will head TP \uc2 ICAP\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Data & \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  unit, which the company has earmarked as a key future revenue generator. It is targeting asset managers and asset owners as they seek to source more financial data independently.\par \par \uc2 TP \uc2 ICAP\uc2  is the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest generator of over-the-counter trade data, especially for energy and commodities markets, but it has typically sold its data to third party providers like Bloomberg and \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 First half revenues for the unit, for the six months to June 30, rose 12 per cent to \u163\'00\'A357m and in January TP \uc2 ICAP\uc2  further beefed up the unit with the purchase of assets from Burton-Taylor International Consulting, the data compiler. That deal included Douglas Taylor, the consultancy\u8217\'20\'19s founder and managing partner.\par \par \uc2 Mr Sinclair had been slated to run the combined \uc2 London Stock Exchange Group\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 TMX data business if 2011 merger between the two bourses had gone ahead.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171101edb1005xy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Economy\par {\*\bkmkstart toc55}{\*\bkmkend toc55}\b \uc2 Trump to Tap Jerome Powell as Next Fed Chairman; The president is expected to announce his decision Thursday\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kate Davidson, Peter Nicholas and David Harrison \par \uc2 1,382 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 November 2017\par 23:10\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Central Banking\par \uc2 RSTPROCB\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The White House has notified Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell that President Donald Trump intends to nominate him as the next chairman of the central bank, according to a person familiar with the matter, a move likely to combine continuity on interest-rate policy with perhaps a lighter touch on financial regulation.\par \par \uc2 If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Powell would succeed Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, the central bank's first female leader, whose four-year term as Fed chief expires in early February.\par \par \uc2 In his five years at the Fed, Mr. Powell has been a reliable ally of Ms. Yellen and would likely {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-jerome-powells-views-1506722559"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 continue the Fed's current cautious approach}}}\uc2  to reversing the central bank's crisis-era stimulus policies as the economy expands.\par \par \uc2 That would mean gradually raising short-term interest rates in quarter-percentage-point steps through 2020 while slowly shrinking the Fed's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities it purchased to lower long-term rates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell's nomination would mark the first time in nearly four decades that a new president hasn't asked the serving Fed leader to stay on for another term, even though that person was nominated by a president of a different party. The last time a first-term president didn't do that was in 1978, when President Jimmy Carter chose G. William Miller to succeed Arthur Burns.\par \par \uc2 The president spoke with Mr. Powell on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter who couldn't describe what they discussed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump had settled on Mr. Powell by Saturday, but people familiar with the process had cautioned that he could change his mind. The president plans to formally announce the decision Thursday before he leaves for a trip to Asia on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Reached by phone Wednesday, both Mr. Powell and Ms. Yellen declined to comment. A Fed spokeswoman also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen was one of five finalists for the position, along with Stanford University economics professor John Taylor, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh didn't respond to requests seeking comment Wednesday. Mr. Cohn's spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said in a video last week that he had "somebody very specific in mind" for the job. "It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job," Mr. Trump said in a video posted to \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , adding, "I think everybody will be very impressed."\par \par \uc2 Fed officials began raising their benchmark federal-funds rate in December 2015 after holding it near zero for seven years following the financial crisis. They voted in June to lift rates to a range between 1% and 1.25% and in October started the process of slowly shrinking the Fed's bond portfolio.\par \par \uc2 "The economy is as close to our assigned goals as it has been for many years," Mr. Powell said in June. If it continues growing as expected, "I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates."\par \par \uc2 Officials have penciled in one more rate increase this year. But they indicated in September such increases are likely to end at a lower point than they had previously projected\u8212\'20\'14at a longer-run level of around 2.75%\u8212\'20\'14considerably lower than where officials have stopped raising rates in the past.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in July, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-cohn-and-yellen-are-contenders-to-lead-the-fed-1501011815"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 "I'd like to see rates stay low."}}}\par \par \uc2 The Fed on Wednesday {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-leaves-rates-unchanged-cites-solid-rate-of-economic-growth-1509559341"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 left short-term interest rates unchanged}}}\uc2 , but signaled it would consider lifting them before year's end amid signs the economy is gaining momentum.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell has never dissented on a Fed monetary or regulatory policy vote and in speeches hasn't deviated far from the board's consensus.\par \par \uc2 Where he could lead a shift is on regulatory policy. He has advocated loosening some of the financial rules adopted by the Fed and other agencies since the crisis, a position that meshes with Mr. Trump's deregulatory agenda. Mr. Powell has suggested softening the Volcker rule barring banks from using their own money to make risky bets and easing some bank stress tests.\par \par \uc2 He also has endorsed reviewing some of the supervisory duties imposed on banks' boards of directors to prevent them from being burdened with "an ever-increasing checklist."\par \par \uc2 "More regulation is not the best answer to every problem," {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-powell-regulation-must-take-account-of-market-impact-1507208702"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mr. Powell said in a speech}}}\uc2  in early October.\par \par \uc2 "To some extent he offers Trump the best of both worlds. You get broadly speaking continuity of Yellen's careful and relatively dovish approach to monetary policy but with somebody who is a card-carrying Republican and who is significantly more inclined to revisit some of the postcrisis regulations," said \uc2 Krishna Guha\uc2 , vice chairman at Evercore ISI and a former \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  official.\par \par \uc2 Karen Petrou, managing partner of the financial-services consulting firm \uc2 Federal Financial \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , said Mr. Powell's recent remarks on regulation "were certainly much more flexible than [Ms. Yellen] has been."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell, a lawyer, would be the first Fed leader in three decades without a Ph.D. in economics. Before joining the Fed board, Mr. Powell worked as an investment banker in New York City, as Treasury undersecretary for financial institutions in the George H.W. Bush administration, as a partner at the \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2  and as a scholar at the \uc2 Bipartisan Policy Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That background could serve him well, said Aaron Klein, an economic studies fellow at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  and director of the Center on Regulation and Markets.\par \par \uc2 "The Federal Reserve's mandate has grown significantly since the financial crisis," he said. "With a broader mandate, one should expect broader and more diverse backgrounds of potential good fits for a chair."\par \par \uc2 "He would represent continuity of the Fed system and culture but a break from the predominance of monetary policy as the core background of the chair," Mr. Klein said.\par \par \uc2 The decision marks the culmination of an unusually public and drawn-out search for one of the top economic policy-making jobs in the world.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump upended the usually staid selection process by openly weighing the pros and cons of various candidates and asking lawmakers, businesspeople and media personalities for their input.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump polled GOP senators last month on their preferred choice at a lunch on Capitol Hill, and said he was still considering "two, and maybe three" people for the job.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has other opportunities to reshape the central bank. Randal Quarles, his first nominee to the Fed's powerful seven-member board of governors, took office in October. Three other seats remain open.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen's term as a Fed governor doesn't expire until 2024, and she {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-leaves-door-open-to-stay-at-fed-after-chairman-term-ends-1481749238"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 hasn't ruled out staying on}}}\uc2  in that position after her term as chairwoman ends. The decision would be unusual, but not unprecedented. Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles remained a governor for three years after not being reappointed to the top job by President Harry Truman.\par \par \uc2 Nominations for all board positions, including chairman and vice chairman, are subject to Senate confirmation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell should have little trouble winning Senate approval, but his views could clash with those of some Republican senators who have criticized him for supporting the Fed's easy-money and postcrisis regulatory policies.\par \par \uc2 He won confirmation to the Fed with bipartisan support in the Senate twice before: to fill an unfinished governor's term in 2012 and for a full term in 2014. Some Republicans have suggested he could face difficult questions from his own side of the aisle. "I think we should move in a different direction," from current Fed policies, Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said last month about the possibility of a Powell nomination.\par \par \uc2 Write to Kate Davidson at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:kate.davidson@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 kate.davidson@wsj.com}}}\uc2 , Peter Nicholas at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:peter.nicholas@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 peter.nicholas@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and David Harrison at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:david.harrison@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 david.harrison@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-leaves-rates-unchanged-cites-solid-rate-of-economic-growth-1509559341"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Central Bank Holds Rates Steady}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerome-powell-on-fed-policy-in-his-own-words-1509572668"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jerome Powell in His Own Words}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://graphics.wsj.com/pro/centralbanking/speeches/fed?mod=WSJPro_topnav&speaker=Jerome H.

\par\par \uc2 Tech\par {\*\bkmkstart toc56}{\*\bkmkend toc56}\b \uc2 Facebook Profit Jumps 79%, Revenue Up; Still, company remains under scrutiny over Russian activity\b0\par\par\uc2 By Deepa Seetharaman \par \uc2 774 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 November 2017\par 23:52\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . extended its dominance in online advertising in the third quarter but said it would sacrifice some future growth to invest more heavily in its safety and security operations to address the growing scrutiny of its power and influence.\par \par \uc2 The social-media giant reported a 79% jump in third-quarter profit on Wednesday, the same day lawmakers grilled executives from \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  during congressional hearings that focused on alleged Russian propagandists' activity during the election. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  together capture the bulk of the growth in digital advertising.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  plans to double the number of employees and contractors who handle safety and security issues to 20,000 by the end of 2018. It is also redoubling security-focused engineering efforts in some areas and building new \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  systems to detect what Chief Executive \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  described as "bad content and bad actors." \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's 2018 expenses could rise as much as 60% compared with 2017.\par \par \uc2 "I am dead serious about this," Mr. Zuckerberg told investors. "I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward."\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  is confronting one of the toughest periods in its 13-year history. This week, Facebook's general counsel faced a series of hostile questions from U.S. lawmakers over its failure to detect the way Russian propagandists used its platform to spread divisive content through ads, free posts and event listings.\par \par \uc2 The grilling raises the specter of regulation and added scrutiny, which could slow \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's growth and ability to rapidly develop new products. The crisis also put \uc2 Facebook\uc2  in the awkward position of playing down the effectiveness of the Russian ads while touting the strength of its ad targeting and reach to legitimate advertisers.\par \par \uc2 Advertisers, too, are wary of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's video ad products after a series of missteps in calculating advertising performance.\par \par \uc2 "The underlying issue is whether \uc2 Facebook\uc2  can be sufficiently trusted by stakeholders," said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Weiser. "There's always been this concern that at the top of the company they're not taking these matters seriously enough. Lack of trust creates friction, lack of trust creates rules and those rules come with costs."\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  reported a third-quarter profit of $1.59 a share, up from 90 cents a share a year ago. The company also generated $10.33 billion in revenue, up from $7.01 billion in the prior year's quarter.\par \par \uc2 The firestorm about Russia hasn't hurt \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's popularity. The company increased its monthly active user base to 2.07 billion.\par \par \uc2 Its shares were down 2% in after-hours trading. The stock price is up more than 59% this year through Wednesday's close.\par \par \uc2 Since the 2016 U.S. presidential election, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has faced immense criticism for allowing misinformation, propaganda and violent videos to proliferate on its service and shape political discourse around the world.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  reinvigorated the debate two months ago after it disclosed that Russian-linked Facebook accounts bought thousands of ads that sought to inflame social and political tensions before and after election.\par \par \uc2 In congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday, General Counsel Colin Stretch faced questions that went beyond \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's role in the 2016 election and touched on its ad-targeting capabilities and content policies.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  said 146 million users saw posts from accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a pro-Kremlin outfit that sought to use \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to amplify social divisions in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  is relying on both human oversight and nascent technology, like \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , to address concerns. Earlier this year, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  committed to hire a total of 4,000 people to review content and ads. The company is testing a feature that would show some \uc2 Facebook\uc2  users more information about the entities behind ads on its platform. Chief Operating Officer \uc2 Sheryl Sandberg\uc2  said the company was exploring similar steps to inform users about the people behind political pages on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In March, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  added staff and started working on new technology to more quickly detect live broadcasts on its platform that show a user who might hurt him or herself. \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , which largely relies on users to flag the videos, now reviews them within 10 minutes, Mr. Zuckerberg said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Write to Deepa Seetharaman at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-needs-the-right-kind-of-friends-1509575088?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heard on the Street: Facebook Needs the Right Kind of Friends}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-ads-targeted-facebook-users-by-profile-1509563354?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 New Facebook Data Shows Russians Targeted Users by Race, Religion, Politics}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171101edb1005v5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Pitney Bowes Inc\uc2 . said Wednesday it is looking at strategic alternatives as the shipping-services company struggles to grow amid lower mail volume.\par \par \uc2 Shares fell nearly 13% in morning trading after \uc2 Pitney Bowes\uc2  reported a decline in income in the third quarter, missing analysts' expectations, and Chief Executive \uc2 Marc Lautenbach\uc2  said, "We believe now is the time to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives that may have the potential to further unlock shareholder value."\par \par \uc2 Pitney Bowes\uc2  said it had hired financial and legal advisers, but that no decisions had been made and that the exploration of alternatives might not result in any action.\par \par \uc2 The Connecticut-based company also announced plans to cut spending by $200 million over the next two years. Costs in the third quarter were $767.9 million, compared with $745.4 million last year.\par \par \uc2 Net income for the quarter was $57.4 million, or 31 cents a share, down from $65.5 million last year. Adjusted earnings per share were 33 cents. Analysts were predicting 42 cents a share. Revenue was $842.8 million, slightly up from $839 million last year.\par \par \uc2 The company has struggled to stem a decline in revenue as lower mail volume has cut into its core business of providing shipping and mailing services to companies. In the third quarter, revenue in its digital-commerce group, which accounts for about a quarter of total revenue, grew 19%. But revenue in the company's two mailing and shipping services units combined was down 4.5%.\par \par \uc2 Pitney Bowes\uc2  did say it expects faster revenue growth this year, because of the acquisition of \uc2 Newgistics Inc\uc2 ., a Texas-based company that focuses on things such as shipping and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  for brands and retailers. \uc2 Pitney Bowes{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/littlejohn-to-sell-newgistics-to-pitney-bowes-for-475-million-1504720372"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bought the company for $475 million last month}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The company said it now expects revenue to grow 3% to 5% in 2017, compared with earlier expectations that the figure would be flat to 1%. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share for the year to be between $1.38 and $1.46. It had previously anticipated earnings per share between $1.70 and $1.78.\par \par \uc2 Write to Allison Prang at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:allison.prang@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 allison.prang@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171101edb1003uy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc60}{\*\bkmkend toc60}\b \uc2 International Property Report: China: Beijing's Moves Ripple Across the Globe --- Capital controls grow tighter on investment in commercial sector; U.S. appears to slow\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dominique Fong and Esther Fung \par \uc2 986 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 November 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 China's controls on capital outflow are putting a chill on some global commercial real-estate markets.\par \par \uc2 Since late 2016, policy makers in Beijing have been tightening restrictions on overseas investments and scrutinizing some of the country's most ambitious deal makers, voicing concerns that deals in certain sectors were disguises for capital flight into havens.\par \par \uc2 In August, \uc2 China's powerful State Council\uc2  announced that property investments abroad were "restricted," along with deals in hotels, movie studios and sports teams. The directive called for a move away from "irrational" projects, widely seen by real-estate analysts and brokers as a criticism of the large foreign real-estate investments made by Chinese firms in recent years. At the recent Communist Party congress, where President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  solidified his control, officials reiterated concerns about systemic risks stemming from ill-considered purchases abroad.\par \par \uc2 Outbound capital from China into foreign properties and development sites reached a record $36.8 billion in 2016, according to data firm Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .Volume for the first three quarters of this year was $19.7 billion. In the U.S. real-estate market, capital from China slowed to $5.1 billion in the same nine-month period, down from a total of $14.8 billion in 2016, said Real Capital. These are deals that are $10 million and greater.\par \par \uc2 The drop in foreign investments comes as commercial real-estate markets in the U.S. and Europe show signs of slowing growth and years of rising prices. Sales volume is down in most major cities.\par \par \uc2 Real-estate executives and lawyers in the U.S. said there could be premature sales of Chinese-led American projects.\par \par \uc2 Greenland Holdings Group, a China state-owned property developer with projects in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, is considering selling part of its 42-acre waterfront development site in south San Francisco to \uc2 Kilroy Realty Corp\uc2 ., according to people familiar with the matter. Greenland, alongside three other equity partners, purchased the project in August 2016.\par \par \uc2 Greenland USA said its strategy has long included a willingness to work with local developers. "China's capital controls will have a certain impact on immature companies, but it doesn't mean it will restrict or affect the development path of companies that have international perspective and core competencies," it said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Investors that follow strict mandates approved by the Chinese government, such as the sovereign-wealth fund Chinese Investment Corp., continue to be active in overseas real-estate markets. CIC bought a warehouse portfolio in Europe from \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2  for 12.25 billion euros ($14 billion) in June. And property investments in line with Beijing's foreign policy initiatives, such as the "One Belt One Road" program to revive the ancient Silk Road trading routes, have been given the green light.\par \par \uc2 Real-estate companies based in Hong Kong also appear to be less affected. Companies based in Hong Kong this year bought two high-profile London buildings, nicknamed the "Cheesegrater" and "Walkie Talkie."\par \par \uc2 But government policies have pushed some of the country's most highflying conglomerates, like \uc2 Dalian Wanda Group\uc2  and \uc2 Anbang Insurance Group\uc2 , to throttle back.\par \par \uc2 "One thing that's concerned the regulators, these rich entrepreneurs were leveraged to the hilt, using investors' money, using [People's Republic of China] banks' money, and leaving all the risk to the PRC investors and PRC banks," said Howard Zhang, a Beijing-based partner at law firm \uc2 Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP\uc2 . "There's a strong sentiment among the regulators, as well as among the general rank and file who resent how rich these people have become."\par \par \uc2 It now takes longer to get cross-border deals approved. Chinese government approval of such transactions usually takes at least three to six months but now may be delayed, Mr. Zhang said.\par \par \uc2 Hotel investments also have dropped off. Chinese investors remain wary of drawing the kind of government scrutiny that befell \uc2 Wu Xiaohui\uc2 , chairman of Anbang, who made headlines after scooping up Manhattan's Waldorf Astoria hotel in 2014 for $1.95 billion. Mr. Wu was detained in June by authorities who are investigating corruption. His whereabouts is unknown.\par \par \uc2 To assuage concerns from foreign contractors and partners, some Chinese companies have made public statements about their offshore funds or their ability to raise money through U.S. dollar bond issuances.\par \par \uc2 But increasingly, firms are toeing the party line. "Investors with capital already outside of China will continue to show strong interests allocating capital to U.S. real estate . . . though those in this category, even ostensively private companies, are progressively less free to ignore what goes on in China," said Andrew Levy, senior counsel at law firm \uc2 DLA Piper\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Companies have taken notice of Beijing's list of "encouraged" overseas investments, and investments in logistics, senior care projects, health care and data centers have surged.\par \par \uc2 PGC Capital, a Shanghai-based boutique investment bank, has invested around GBP 500 million ($658 million) in U.K. property since 2015. The firm is redeveloping a former Birmingham car dealership into apartments. It is also eyeing a land purchase in Warsaw to potentially build a complex of 3,000 housing units and high-end hotels to develop a new town.\par \par \uc2 Denise Li, founder and chief executive of PGC Capital, said that because the company's planned projects include infrastructure construction, they support Beijing's One Belt One Road program to build Chinese-backed ports, railways and pipelines in dozens of countries from Europe and Africa to China. PGC Capital also says it helps Chinese state-owned companies find overseas investments for the same purpose.\par \par \uc2 "It very much follows the guiding opinions of the One Belt One Road initiative," Ms. Li said.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich449\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal6735

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Aetna Inc\uc2 . posted increased profit but a decline in revenue for its latest quarter as the insurer highlighted moves to reposition its offerings and set itself up for long-term growth.\par \par \uc2 During a call with analysts to discuss earnings, \uc2 Aetna\uc2  executives declined to address a report in The Wall Street Journal that \uc2 CVS Health Corp\uc2 . was in talks to purchase the company for over $66 billion.\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive \uc2 Mark T. Bertolini\uc2  said the company won't "comment on rumors or speculation." He did, however, say that \uc2 Aetna\uc2  aims to announce its plans for its pharmacy-benefit contract with CVS by the middle of next year, and that CVS's agreement to service the new pharmacy-benefit manager being launched by \uc2 Anthem Inc\uc2 . is "not a problem for us." The existing \uc2 Aetna\uc2  contract with CVS goes through 2022, but \uc2 Aetna\uc2  has the ability to opt out at the start of 2020.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bertolini also said \uc2 Aetna\uc2  is poised to resume sales of short-term health insurance if the Trump administration removes a cap limiting such plans to three months' duration, a move encouraged by a recent executive order.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bertolini also played up \uc2 Aetna\uc2 's long-term growth trajectory as a stand-alone company, despite several moves that would be blows to its revenue in 2018. \uc2 Aetna\uc2 's continued retreat from the Affordable Care Act exchanges, the sale of its life and disability business, and some pullbacks in Medicaid will affect revenue next year, the company said.\par \par \uc2 Looking forward, Mr. Bertolini emphasized \uc2 Aetna\uc2 's growth in Medicare, including its performance in the federal program's quality rankings, and investments \uc2 Aetna\uc2  is making in data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \uc2 Aetna\uc2  also said it is looking for growth in Medicaid over the long term.\par \par \uc2 Aetna\uc2  has said it is exiting the ACA exchanges next year, but Mr. Bertolini said that if the business "gets right and stable, we'll look at reconsidering on how we get in."\par \par \uc2 Aetna\uc2  on Tuesday again raised its profit forecast for 2017, predicting adjusted earnings per share of $9.75. The company previously estimated per share earnings between $9.45 and $9.55.\par \par \uc2 Total adjusted revenue at \uc2 Aetna\uc2  declined 5% to $14.95 billion in the third quarter, as fewer people were on the company's ACA plans and from the temporary suspension of the ACA health-insurance tax.\par \par \uc2 Analysts were expecting revenue of $15.13 billion.\par \par \uc2 Aetna\uc2  posted net income of $838 million for the third quarter, a 39% increase from a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, net income rose 11% to $814 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.45, beating analysts' estimates of $2.09 a share. In the prior-year quarter, the company earned $2.07 on an adjusted per share basis.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich442\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal6630

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2 's prestigious economics department will be renamed for billionaire hedge-fund manager \uc2 Kenneth Griffin\uc2 , who will give $125 million to the university.\par \par \uc2 The Citadel LLC\uc2  founder and chief executive's gift, announced Wednesday, will be used to pay for more economics professors, expanded financial aid for students and creation of a research incubator, among other things.\par \par \uc2 "You need resources to take long bets," said John List, the \uc2 Kenneth C. Griffin\uc2  Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the university and chairman of what will now be called the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Griffin, who graduated from \uc2 Harvard University\uc2 , lives in Chicago and became a \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  trustee in 2014. He said in a statement the university "has transformed our understanding of economics" and its faculty and students "have challenged the status quo to produce pioneering research and path-breaking ideas."\par \par \uc2 He added, "The culture of rigorous questioning and open discourse at the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  has opened minds to ideas that have changed the world."\par \par \uc2 The university, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122610604643110229"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 namesake of the Chicago school of economics}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116369744597625238"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 long associated with free-market champions}}}\uc2  like Milton Friedman, is one of the nation's leading hubs of economic research and thought. Economics is the most popular major and six current Chicago professors are Nobel laureates in economics including {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nobel-prize-in-economics-awarded-to-richard-h-thaler-1507543046"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 this year's winner}}}\uc2 , behavioral economist \uc2 Richard Thaler\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The intended gift, coming from the Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund, will be the second-largest in the private university's history. In 2008, investor David Booth donated {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122601317069606639"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $300 million to the business school}}}\uc2 , which was renamed the \uc2 University of Chicago Booth School of Business\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. List said the gift will expand the department's size and boost resources for faculty members as well as undergraduates and graduate students. It also will pay for a "research incubator that will fund economists across the campus who we feel are good long bets" but whose research wouldn't necessarily attract funding from more-traditional sources such as government agencies and foundations, he said.\par \par \uc2 An example of such research, he said, would be the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-becker-a-nobel-prize-winning-economist-dies-at-83-1399255231"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 groundbreaking work on social problems}}}\uc2  by the late Chicago economist Gary Becker, who started in the 1950s outside the mainstream but ended up birthing a "core line of thinking" in economics. Becker won the Nobel Prize in 1992.\par \par \uc2 Modern economics research, with elements like \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis and field experiments, is more labor-intensive than past efforts and requires more resources, Mr. List said.\par \par \uc2 "Economists are moving more and more to putting together teams...who are going out and generating their own data rather than standing by passively and waiting for data," he said. To do that well, he said, "you need a new funding model."\par \par \uc2 Write to Ben Leubsdorf at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:ben.leubsdorf@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ben.leubsdorf@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171101edb1000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

What are they afraid of?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Justin Lahart \par \uc2 533 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2017\par 09:30\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 There are lots of good reasons for startups {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/leaving optimists to do the buying"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 to stay private}}}\uc2 , and no one knows that better than \uc2 Julie Wainwright\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She is the founder of RealReal, a successful privately held online retailer that has gone through seven rounds of funding. Ms. Wainwright was also the CEO of Pets.com, which shut down when the cash ran out in Nov. 2000, seven months after going public.\par \par \uc2 The flood of cash into startups has allowed companies to stay private for far longer than in the past. On the positive side, companies have more time to develop and grow. But the lack of a public market valuation also raises the question of whether many companies are worth the $1 billion-plus values private investors have attached to them.\par \par \uc2 A lot of richly valued startups are so old that saying they need time to develop and grow is a bit of a joke. Ride-hailing service Uber, which is valued at $68 billion, has been around for over eight years. \b \highlight22\uc2 Big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  analysis firm Palantir, valued at $20 billion, is 13 years old. \uc2 SpaceX\uc2 , the \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 -led rocket maker valued at $21 billion, is 15 years old.\par \par \uc2 It was different in the dot-com era. Then companies had fewer funding rounds and went public quickly. The 371 technology companies that had initial public offerings in 1999 had a median age of four years, according to data compiled by University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, versus a median age of 10.5 years for 2016's 20 tech IPOs.\par \par \uc2 The rush was part of what created problems later. Once companies went public, it wasn't easy for them to raise more cash. RealReal is a study in contrasts with Ms. Wainwright's former business. The San Francisco-based online upscale-goods reseller has been able to get the cash it needs to fund six years of operations.\par \par \uc2 What hasn't changed, she says, is that private-market valuations may not reflect the valuations companies carry in the public markets. (Unlike many of its peers, the RealReal has remained mum on its valuation.)\par \par \uc2 Multiple funding rounds, each at a higher valuation, can exacerbate the problem, widening the gap between private-market belief and public-market reality. In the private market, pessimists sit out funding rounds,{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/testing-silicon-valleys-greater-fool-strategy-1433263727"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  leaving optimists to do the buying}}}\uc2 ; in the public market, the pessimists could sell or short the shares, driving down the share price.\par \par \uc2 With all that money riding on them, companies may be scared to go public during less-than perfect market conditions, worried that they will end up like food company Blue Apron. It was valued at $2 billion before going public this June and now has a market capitalization of less than $1 billion.\par \par \uc2 Yet right now, with the U.S. economy in the ninth year of an economic expansion and the stock market clocking new highs, is the perfect time to go public. What are they waiting for?\par \par \uc2 Write to Justin Lahart at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:justin.lahart@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 justin.lahart@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171031edav001jm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Aetna Inc\uc2 . posted increased profit but a decline in revenue for its latest quarter as the insurer highlighted moves to reposition its offerings and set itself up for long-term growth.\par \par \uc2 During a call with analysts to discuss earnings, \uc2 Aetna\uc2  executives declined to address a report in The Wall Street Journal that \uc2 CVS Health Corp\uc2 . was in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cvs-health-is-in-talks-to-buy-aetna-sources-1509047642"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 talks to purchase the company }}}\uc2 for more than $66 billion.\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive \uc2 Mark T. Bertolini\uc2  said the company won't "comment on rumors or speculation." He did, however, say that \uc2 Aetna\uc2  aims to announce its plans for the future of its pharmacy-benefit contract with CVS by the middle of next year, and that CVS's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-signs-five-year-deal-with-cvs-for-services-to-new-pharmacy-benefit-manager-ingeniorx-1508326194"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 agreement to service the new pharmacy-benefit manager}}}\uc2  being launched by \uc2 Anthem Inc\uc2 . is "not a problem for us." The existing \uc2 Aetna\uc2  contract with CVS goes through 2022, but \uc2 Aetna\uc2  has the ability to opt out at the start of 2020.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bertolini also said \uc2 Aetna\uc2  is poised to plunge back into sales of short-term health insurance if the Trump administration{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-start-to-unwinding-the-health-law-trump-to-ease-insurance-rules-1507771015"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  removes a cap limiting such plans}}}\uc2  to three months' duration, a move encouraged by a recent executive order.\par \par \uc2 He said \uc2 Aetna\uc2  is "already all over that," and, once regulations come out fleshing out the executive order, "we will be prepared when we have the opportunity to act." But he said \uc2 Aetna\uc2  is looking at the short-term plans rather than so-called skinny coverage that would fall short of the protections of full health insurance and can create "moral harm," he said. Skinny coverage is a term that is often used to describe products such as indemnity plans, which pay a set amount toward certain medical services such as hospital stays.\par \par \uc2 Aetna Chief Financial Officer Shawn M. Guertin said in an interview that the company was looking at "limited-term products, not limited-benefit products."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bertolini also played up \uc2 Aetna\uc2 's long-term growth trajectory as a stand-alone company, despite several moves that would be blows to its revenue in 2018. \uc2 Aetna\uc2 's continued retreat from the Affordable Care Act exchanges, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hartford-to-acquire-aetna-group-life-disability-business-1508757190"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sale of its life and disability business}}}\uc2  and some pullbacks in Medicaid will affect revenue next year, the company said.\par \par \uc2 Aetna\uc2  said the impact on profit would be less, particularly given the losses on the ACA business, though like other insurers it said earnings next year will take a hit from the expected return of the ACA tax on health plans, which had been suspended.\par \par \uc2 Looking forward, Mr. Bertolini emphasized \uc2 Aetna\uc2 's growth in Medicare, including its performance in the federal program's quality rankings, and investments \uc2 Aetna\uc2  is making in data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \uc2 Aetna\uc2  also said it is looking for growth in Medicaid over the long term.\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. Bertolini didn't discuss CVS, he did talk about efforts to get closer to consumers by providing care in settings cheaper than a hospital and helping them avoid emergency-room visits and other costly care.\par \par \uc2 He said \uc2 Aetna\uc2  didn't need to own health-care providers and services. In a previous earnings call, he had discussed CVS's drugstores as one pathway to providing contact and support for consumers.\par \par \uc2 Aetna\uc2  has said it is exiting the ACA exchanges next year, but Mr. Bertolini said that if the business "gets right and stable, we'll look at reconsidering on how we get in."\par \par \uc2 Aetna\uc2  on Tuesday again raised its profit forecast for 2017, predicting adjusted earnings per share of $9.75. The company previously estimated per-share earnings between $9.45 and $9.55.\par \par \uc2 Total adjusted revenue at \uc2 Aetna\uc2  fell 5% to $14.95 billion as fewer people were on the company's ACA plans and from the temporary suspension of the ACA health-insurance tax. Analysts were expecting revenue of $15.13 billion. The company had predicted individual ACA plans would lose more than $200 million in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Aetna\uc2  posted net income of $838 million for the third quarter, up 39% from a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, net income rose 11% to $814 million. Adjusted earnings per share rose to $2.45, beating analysts' estimates of $2.09 a share. In the prior-year quarter, \uc2 Aetna\uc2  earned $2.07 on an adjusted per-share basis.\par \par \uc2 Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:anna.mathews@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 anna.mathews@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Allison Prang at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:allison.prang@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 allison.prang@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 More\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cvs-bid-for-aetna-followed-a-long-hunt-1509147450"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 CVS Bid for Aetna Followed a Long Hunt }}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cvs-health-is-in-talks-to-buy-aetna-sources-1509047642"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 CVS Makes Blockbuster Aetna Bid}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurers-make-final-call-on-aca-plans-1506519297"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Health Insurers Stay in ACA Despite Fears of Last-Minute Exits}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-potential-cvs-aetna-deal-1509129970"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How Would CVS and Aetna Fit Together?}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/10/27/cvs-aetna-deal-could-spark-merger-mania/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 CVS, Aetna Deal Could Spark 'Merger Mania'}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-reason-cvs-wants-to-buy-aetna-amazon-com-1509057307"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A Force Behind the Aetna Bid: Amazon}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drug-price-squeeze-is-driving-cvs-and-aetna-talks-1509054691"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heard on the Street: Drug Prices Drive CVS, Aetna}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171031edav0025u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

While Mr. Quarles was confirmed by the full Senate about a month later and was sworn into office on Oct. 13, Mr. Otting remains in Senate limbo.\par \par \uc2 The delay comes as senators have focused on other priorities, such as the ultimately failed health-care overhaul. Much of this week's floor time, for instance, is expected to be consumed by a spate unrelated judicial nominees. But congressional aides and lobbyists expect Mr. Otting will eventually win Senate confirmation, succeeding Keith Noreika, who has served as acting comptroller since May.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett faces a rockier path. The former House lawmaker is due to testify Wednesday before the banking committee, where it is unclear he has the support needed to advance his nomination to the floor. The nomination is contentious at least in part because Mr. Garrett has repeatedly pushed to dismantle the agency he seeks to lead.\par \par \uc2 Republicans hold just one more seat than Democrats on the banking panel and at least two Republicans, Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Mike Rounds of South Dakota, have said they are undecided on Mr. Garrett. If a majority of the committee doesn't back Mr. Garrett, his nomination cannot advance to the full Senate, a committee spokeswoman said. No Democrats are expected to support him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rounds has met with Mr. Garrett twice and "he looks forward to continuing their discussion this week," a spokeswoman for the South Dakota senator said.\par \par \uc2 "In order to earn my vote for this position, Mr. Garrett needs to make a clear and public statement that he will not seek to dismantle the bank and that he will support its reauthorization," Mr. Scott said in a statement. "He will have that opportunity when he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, where I will be asking some direct and pointed questions regarding the future of the Bank."\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Day Trader Profited from Hacked Brokerage Accounts, SEC Says\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A day trader based near Philadelphia earned more than $700,000 by trading against investors whose brokerage accounts had been hacked, the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  alleged in a lawsuit filed Monday.\par \par \uc2 The SEC said such account-intrusion schemes are a growing type of threat from hackers targeting ordinary investors.\par \par \uc2 "We are committing substantial resources to combating cyber-based threats to protect investors and our markets from intruders who manipulate the system," SEC enforcement co-director \uc2 Stephanie Avakian\uc2  said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 The trader, Joseph Willner, used short sales and other trades to sell stocks at inflated prices and buy them at steep discounts. A hacker who Mr. Willner met online, unnamed in the complaint, gained access to the victims' accounts and purchased the stocks that Mr. Willner sold at artificially high prices, according to court records. Much of the trading took place after normal market hours, when stocks are vulnerable to wider price swings and rules that seek to ensure investors get the best price across all markets don't apply.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Willner paid a cut of the profits to his alleged partner in bitcoin to cover up their relationship, the SEC's complaint said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Willner, 42 years old, is also a defendant in a related criminal case, according to court records unsealed last week in federal court in Brooklyn. He declined to comment. His attorney couldn't immediately be reached.\par \par \uc2 The alleged misconduct took place from September 2014 to August 2016 and involved at least 110 brokerage accounts whose owners didn't know they were being exploited to generate illegal profits for Mr. Willner and his trading partner, the SEC said.\par \par \uc2 Brokerage firms that held the victims' accounts incurred losses exceeding $2 million, according to court records. Individual investors whose accounts were hacked could have been reimbursed by their brokers for any losses.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Willner began communicating in September 2014 with the other trader, who invited him "to participate in the stock fraud and manipulation scheme," according to a \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  arrest warrant affidavit unsealed last week. Some of their exchanges took place through Twitter while others took place through private chat rooms, according to the arrest warrant. Mr. Willner told another contact that he knew the trader's offer was "super shady" and was worried about being left "holding the bag," the affidavit says.\par \par \uc2 "There are foreigners who can exploit easy glitches on our markets to implement, cheat and make instant easy gains," Mr. Willner wrote in an online message in October 2014, according to the arrest warrant. "There are also Russian and Chinese hackers that can make money on our market at will."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Willner later agreed to work with the trader, who wanted half of the profits, according to the SEC's complaint and the arrest warrant. After Mr. Willner told the trader that he also wanted to do legitimate trades, according to the SEC, the person replied: "Legal trading too hard."\par \par \uc2 Much of Mr. Willner's trading activity, according to the arrest warrant, involved less liquid stocks and was done outside of regular trading hours. In one example from 2015, Mr. Willner allegedly netted a profit of $2,900 by selling shares of \uc2 First Community Corp\uc2 ., a regional bank holding company, for $14.88 when the stock had closed that day at $11.64.\par \par \uc2 The shares were purchased by an account controlled by Mr. Willner's unnamed partner. Because Mr. Willner had borrowed the shares to sell them short, he had to buy them back in order to return them to the lender. He purchased them at $9.40 per share from a victim whose account was controlled by the other trader, the SEC said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Willner sent a cut of the profits to the other trader using the bitcoin trading platform \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , according to the arrest warrant.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: The Trump Deregulatory Juggernaut Is Rolling\par \par \uc2 B y Gerald F. Seib\par \par \uc2 Why, you might ask, are the financial markets and the business community so happy with the Trump administration?\par \par \uc2 After all, a Trump presidency carries the risk of a trade war, which alarms investors and big-business leaders; in fact, the business community is actively working against the administration's threat to deep-six the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The GOP tax-cut plan the financial sector has been counting on is only being unveiled this week, and the administration has done nothing so far to launch the promised rebuilding of American infrastructure that business leaders crave.\par \par \uc2 To some extent, then, the explanation for the love affair lies elsewhere, in something many in Washington either find boring or overlook entirely: deregulation.\par \par \uc2 While the Republican machine that emerged from the 2016 election may be sputtering on other fronts, it is proving to be a juggernaut on deregulation. And as a priority for the business community, deregulation ranks right up there with tax cuts and tax reform.\par \par \uc2 A new set of figures from the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  tells the tale of how far and fast the president, his administration and the Republican-controlled Congress have moved.\par \par \uc2 The business group has been keeping a tally of deregulatory actions this year, and its scorecard lists 29 executive actions\u8212\'20\'14executive orders by Mr. Trump or directives from his White House\u8212\'20\'14to reduce regulatory requirements. In response, executive-branch agencies have issued 100 additional directives that either knock down regulations or begin a process to eliminate or shrink them.\par \par \uc2 The chamber's count also lists almost 50 pieces of legislation that have been introduced or begun moving through Congress. And that count doesn't include perhaps the most aggressive step the Republican Congress has taken: It has pioneered the use of a little-known 1996 law, the Congressional Review Act, that allows lawmakers to repeal executive-branch regulations within 60 days after they are finalized.\par \par \uc2 Using that law, Congress has passed, and Mr. Trump has signed, legislation overturning 14 regulations promulgated by President Barack Obama's administration in its final days.\par \par \uc2 Then, just last week, Congress passed legislation repealing a rule put in place this year by the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14created under Mr. Obama's administration\u8212\'20\'14that would have made it easier for consumers to sue banks in financial disputes. The legislation, one of the most significant wins for the financial industry in years, passed the Senate 51-50 when Vice President Mike Pence broke a tie.\par \par \uc2 None of this is as flashy or sexy as a controversy over a 6:30 a.m. tweet from the president attacking his enemies. But the deregulatory push may be the most consequential initiative the Trump administration has taken, perhaps rivaled only by the appointment of dozens of federal judges, who can serve for life.\par \par \uc2 Certainly the business and financial worlds are noticing the deregulatory drive. The economy grew at a 3% rate in the third quarter, the government reported Friday, fueled in part by business spending on new equipment, which rose at an annual 8.6% rate. That spending is one sign business leaders like the new environment.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the stock market is hitting record highs on a regular basis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 18% so far this year.\par \par \uc2 Democrats, on the other hand, aren't pleased. They have begun complaining that the deregulatory rush is both dangerous to the public and the result of work by Trump administration officials with deep conflicts of interest, arising from their careers in affected industries or their personal financial interest in those industries.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, a group of House Democrats introduced legislation that would require agencies to report any conflicts of interest that would arise for the president or senior members of his administration when regulatory rules are being changed. President Trump is "undermining regulations in order to benefit himself, his family, and his close friends," said Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat and one of the bill's sponsors.\par \par \uc2 Such legislation isn't going anywhere in a Republican-controlled Congress, of course.\par \par \uc2 Some of the administration's steps are small-bore\u8212\'20\'14setting up a team to review federal and state rules to ensure that efforts to protect the sage grouse are complementary, for example. But others, particularly those launched by the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2 , are big and broadly significant, including moves already taken to delay and potentially rescind Obama-era Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act rules.\par \par \uc2 Some of the deregulatory actions will unfold slowly: Just as legal requirements for public comment and review periods make issuing regulations a slow process, so too do they mean unwinding regulations can take time and, in some cases, invite court challenges.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, though, there is little Democrats can do to stop the drive\u8212\'20\'14a clear sign that elections do have consequences.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Betting on the Next Fed Chair Often Goes Wrong\par \par \uc2 By James Mackintosh\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump's The Apprentice-style hiring process for the Federal Reserve chair is due to end this week, and it looks like the message to Janet Yellen is: "You're fired!"\par \par \uc2 Jerome Powell, a Fed governor, is the leading candidate to take the world's leading economic job\u8212\'20\'14and he isn't an economist.\par \par \uc2 Investors following the process have been raking over the past pronouncements of the five main candidates, in an effort to understand the direction of Fed policy over the next four years. History suggests that it is tough to make money from betting on a new chairman's hawkishness or dovishness, even if you knew who it was going to be.\par \par \uc2 Political betting site PredictIt has Mr. Powell's chances at 80%, with Ms. Yellen at 8% and academic economist John Taylor at 7%. Outsiders include former Governor \uc2 Kevin Warsh\uc2  ; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari ; and Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump's top economic adviser.\par \par \uc2 Assuming you knew who the president would pick, the most obvious ways to make money would be bets on the direction of Treasury bonds and the dollar, and perhaps inflation-sensitive gold. The clearest example of bets on a Fed chair was in August 1979, when President Jimmy Carter appointed the hawkish Paul Volcker in a sharp break with his predecessor during the inflationary 1970s.\par \par \uc2 Investors expected Mr. Volcker to tackle runaway inflation with tighter monetary policy, meaning higher short-term rates, and they were right. But after his appointment, many bet that a Fed chair committed to bringing down inflation meant lower long-term bond yields, a lower gold price and a stronger dollar. They made money for about two weeks, before being crushed.\par \par \uc2 As inflation soared Mr. Volcker stayed true to forecasts, and short-term rates peaked at 22%, the highest ever, pushing the U.S. into double-dip recessions. Contrary to the expectations of investors, bond yields also jumped, with the 10-year reaching almost 16% in 1981, and far from falling, there was a bubble in the price of gold.\par \par \uc2 Gold was at $304 on the day Mr. Volcker was nominated and fell to $282 as investors bet on his hawkishness. Just five months later gold had nearly tripled to $835, the dollar was weaker and the early Volcker trade was dead and buried.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Volcker's appointment was a case of investors getting the policy positioning of the new chairman right, but their bets on what that meant for asset prices wrong, at least over the next few years.\par \par \uc2 Alan Greenspan's selection was a quite different matter. Conservatives welcomed his appointment in 1987, thinking he shared the hawkish inflation-fighting mind-set of Mr. Volcker, his predecessor. The main point of difference was Mr. Greenspan's willingness to support financial deregulation\u8212\'20\'14something now espoused by Mr. Powell.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Greenspan does seem to have started out hawkish, raising new concerns about inflation at his first Fed policy meeting, according to the transcript. But his hawkish credentials lasted just two months, until the Black Monday stock market crash of October 1987. The new Fed chairman said the central bank stood ready to "serve as a source of liquidity"\u8212\'20\'14thus ushering in the infamous "Greenspan put," the idea that the Fed would step in to support markets in a crisis.\par \par \uc2 A repeat after the Russian default and Wall Street chaos of 1998 helped fuel the final stages of the dot-com bubble, and many believe that Mr. Greenspan pushed up rates too slowly and too predictably during the 2000s, contributing to the excessive risk-taking that ended in the 2008 crisis.\par \par \uc2 One prominent critic of the Fed's precrisis policies is Mr. Taylor, whose "Taylor rule" suggested rates should be higher during the 2000s. The market backed up his view: Gold prices began to rise and the dollar fall from 2002, when the Fed set rates well below what the Taylor rule suggested for the first time since the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 Investors might have been wrong about Mr. Greenspan's commitment to tight money, let alone his devotion to the views of right-wing novelist Ayn Rand, but they were right about his support for financial deregulation.\par \par \uc2 Democratic and Republican presidents stripped the financial sector of the burden of rules introduced in the Great Depression, working wonders on the sector's share prices\u8212\'20\'14at least for a while. By the time Mr. Greenspan left office in 2006 the U.S. financial sector was up 653% since his 1987 appointment, gaining more than double the 319% of nonfinancial stocks, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.\par \par \uc2 Deregulation and easy money had sown the seeds of a crisis few foresaw, however, and Mr. Greenspan declared himself in "a state of shocked disbelief" after the banking system imploded in 2008. Financial stocks fell so much that investors who bought the sector when Mr. Greenspan was appointed are still lagging behind the wider market.\par \par \uc2 We can tentatively say two things about Mr. Powell, assuming he is appointed: he will be friendlier to Wall Street than Ms. Yellen, and he will take a similarly dovish approach to monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 In the short run, less red tape will support bank stocks a bit, but banks surely won't return to their wild precrisis leverage any time soon. Equally, a continuation of Ms. Yellen's cautious approach to rate increases will avoid shocking the market, while leaving unchecked the danger that a bubble develops in the already-expensive stock market.\par \par \uc2 Given investors' dire history of predicting how Fed chairmen will use their power, the wisest approach may be to wait and see how he turns out.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  to Exit Accord on Broker Recruiting\par \par \uc2 By Lisa Beilfuss\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  MS -0.88% said it would abandon a set of recruiting rules that brokerage firms agreed to more than a decade ago, the latest salvo against longtime Wall Street hiring practices as firms pull back on expensive poaching.\par \par \uc2 Firms like \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2  signed on to the rules\u8212\'20\'14known as the Protocol for Broker Recruiting\u8212\'20\'14in 2004 in an effort to limit the number of lawsuits and arbitration claims filed over broker moves by outlining an orderly system for job changes. The protocol limits brokers to taking names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses for "clients that they serviced while at the firm." Brokers are also restricted from telling clients about plans to move.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  said Monday that exiting the accord will allow it to invest more heavily in its current ranks. More than 1,600 securities firms are party to the accord.\par \par \uc2 A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said the New York firm's exit from the protocol is effective Friday. She declined to comment beyond the company's news release. "Over time the Protocol has become replete with opportunities for gamesmanship and loopholes," \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  said in a statement. "In its current state the Protocol is no longer sustainable."\par \par \uc2 Representatives for big rivals, Bank of America 's Merrill Lynch and \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  Advisers, didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's departure from the protocol is the latest move by the big brokerages to change how they recruit talent and assets. Brokerages had been hesitant to pull back from recruiting if their rivals wouldn't, but \uc2 UBS\uc2 's U.S. wealth-management arm said last year that it would reduce by 40% the number of brokers it recruited annually as part of a broader move to improve profitability in the Swiss bank's U.S. wealth unit. Rivals Morgan Stanley and \uc2 Merrill Lynch\uc2  subsequently pulled back on recruitment.\par \par \uc2 The recruiting pullback has been hastened in part by a new retirement-savings regulation, which went into partial effect in June, requiring stewards of retirement accounts to act in clients' best interest rather than sometimes selling products that are simply more lucrative to the brokers themselves. One part of the rule, requiring "reasonable compensation," is helping to speed up a decline in broker poaching because the big bonuses may run afoul of the rule.\par \par \uc2 Brokerages have long engaged in "prisoner exchanges"\u8212\'20\'14poaching each others' employees in their rivalry for talent and assets. They offer signing bonuses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, representing significant chunks of brokers' compensation packages. Such bonuses usually come in the form of promissory notes, or loans that are forgivable after about seven years. These are structured to help retain brokers in a business where clients tend to follow them as they move. A broker who leaves before the term of the contract must repay the remainder.\par \par \uc2 As the biggest brokerages are "slowing up on offense, they're trying to play better defense," said Shirl Penney, chief executive of Dynasty Financial Partners, a firm that helps brokers break away from Wall Street firms and services independent advisers. Mr. Penney said \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's departure from the protocol is meant to make it harder for its brokers to leave.\par \par \uc2 While it isn't clear whether \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 's exit from the protocol will usher in its end, some industry observers say a potential breakdown of the protocol won't stanch the flow of advisers from traditional brokerages and toward independent advisory firms, and could potentially have the opposite effect.\par \par \uc2 "It's not like leaving the protocol will keep brokers from leaving," said Dennis Concilla, head of the securities practices group at Carlile, Patchen & Murphy LLP.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Concilla said about 100 firms have resigned from the protocol since it was established.\par \par \uc2 Manafort Charged With Money Laundering in Russia Probe\par \par \uc2 By Aruna Viswanatha and Del Quentin Wilber\par \par \uc2 Special counsel \uc2 Robert Mueller\uc2  unveiled the first charges Monday stemming from his probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 elections, accusing two former Trump campaign officials of not paying taxes on millions of dollars in income and obtaining a guilty plea from a third who admitted he lied to federal authorities about contacts with Russian go-betweens.\par \par \uc2 The actions represent the most public moves to date from Mr. Mueller, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation director appointed in May to take over the investigation into Russia's election interference and any potential collusion with President Donald Trump's campaign. Taken together, the moves make it clear that Mr. Mueller is entering a higher-profile phase of his investigation, and they suggest that more actions may be coming.\par \par \uc2 They also fix the spotlight back on the Russia questions that have dogged the White House at a time when Mr. Trump is attempting to sell a major tax overhaul that would give him a needed legislative victory in advance of midterm elections next year.\par \par \uc2 Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was taken into custody on charges that he laundered more than $18 million between 2006 and 2016 to pay for what prosecutors described as a "lavish lifestyle"\u8212\'20\'14including rugs, landscaping, cars and clothing\u8212\'20\'14without reporting the income to the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2 . That income was from work he did for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine headed by the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort and longtime business associate Richard Gates were also charged with conspiring against the U.S. and failing for years to register their lobbying activities on behalf of the Ukrainian government. Mr. Manafort is a veteran political operative who has done extensive work overseas.\par \par \uc2 Separately, according to court documents unsealed on Monday, Trump campaign foreign-policy adviser George Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the \uc2 FBI\uc2  about his contacts with or people connected to Russian government officials.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Papadopoulos admitted he spoke to a professor during the campaign who told him the Russians possessed "dirt" on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails," according to court documents. He earlier had told the \uc2 FBI\uc2  those contacts only occurred before he joined the campaign. Mr. Papadopoulos also acknowledged he made repeated efforts to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials, including through a woman he believed was Russian President Vladimir Putin's niece, the documents said.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration has faced questions about the Kremlin's meddling into the 2016 election since before taking office, and U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Mr. Putin ordered an effort to help Mr. Trump and hurt his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, and in the process undermine faith in American institutions. The president has reacted angrily at times to investigations of the matter by lawmakers and prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 The documents released Monday suggest Mr. Mueller is aggressively pursuing multiple avenues of investigation. The special counsel's team, which includes 16 attorneys versed in public-corruption, fraud and national-security matters, as well as more than two dozen \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents, has been presenting evidence before a federal grand jury in Washington since July.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mueller also has been investigating whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in his firing earlier this year of James Comey as FBI director, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Mueller was appointed to the special counsel role just after the president's firing of Mr. Comey.\par \par \uc2 In an appearance before a federal magistrate judge in Washington, attorneys for Messrs. Manafort and Gates entered pleas of not guilty, and both have surrendered their passports. The special counsel's office agreed that Messrs. Manafort and Gates could be confined to home detention.\par \par \uc2 The judge set bail at $10 million for Mr. Manafort and $5 million for Mr. Gates. A hearing has been scheduled for Thursday before Judge Amy Berman Jackson.\par \par \uc2 After the hearing and outside Washington's federal courthouse, a lawyer for Mr. Manafort, Kevin Downing, offered a fiery defense of the former campaign chairman, saying there was "no evidence that Mr. Manafort or the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government." He accused the special counsel of using a "very novel theory" to prosecute Mr. Manafort for failing to register as an agent of a foreign power between 2008 and 2014 and later for allegedly making false and misleading statements on such forms, and he called another aspect of the prosecution to be "ridiculous."\par \par \uc2 Messrs. Manafort and Gates could face as long as 20 years in prison if convicted on one count of conspiracy to launder money alone. They also face charges of being unregistered agents of a foreign power, making false and misleading statements on forms required under the Foreign Agent Registration Act and failing to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts.\par \par \uc2 The charges drew warnings from Democrats that Mr. Trump, after having fired Mr. Comey, not move to fire Mr. Mueller or influence his investigation, a point that has been echoed by some Republicans in the past.\par \par \uc2 "The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel's work in any way," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.).\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) didn't comment directly on Mr. Mueller's actions in an interview with a Wisconsin radio station, but he said, "Nothing's going to derail what we're doing in Congress, because we're working on solving people's problems."\par \par \uc2 The White House said Mr. Manafort's indictment and Mr. Papadopoulos's guilty plea weren't related to the White House or the campaign but were about separate matters or, in Mr. Papadopoulos's case, about the activities of a low-level player. Mr. Trump in March 2016 cited Mr. Papadopoulos as one of five people advising him on foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't have anything to do with us," said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that the president continues to reject any suggestion that he or his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign.\par \par \uc2 The case against the 30-year-old Mr. Papadopoulos, in particular, who lived in London when he joined the Trump campaign, provides the most detailed look yet at Mr. Mueller's inquiry as it relates to alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The documents highlighted, in particular, that Mr. Papadopoulos met with Mr. Trump and his foreign-policy advisers and told the group he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between the candidate and Mr. Putin.\par \par \uc2 "It seems clear that Papadopolous\u8230\'20\'26is cooperating and Mueller's team is building on that cooperation," said Steven Levin, a former federal prosecutor. "Clearly, the special prosecutor wants to obtain evidence and charges against campaign supervisors with Papadopolous' assistance."\par \par \uc2 According to court documents, Mr. Papadopolous met with the professor, who wasn't identified, several times in March 2016, including once with a woman who was introduced to him as a relative of Mr. Putin's. Mr. Papadopoulos sent emails to Trump campaign officials describing the talks as aimed at arranging a meeting between the campaign and Russian leadership "to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump." A campaign "supervisor" responded to Mr. Papadopoulos's efforts by telling him "great work," according to the documents.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Papadopoulos later learned the woman was not in fact related to Mr. Putin, the documents say. But he continued to pursue multiple contacts with an individual in Moscow who claimed to have connections to the \uc2 Russian ministry of foreign affairs\uc2 , pushing for a meeting between Messrs. Trump and Putin.\par \par \uc2 Trump campaign officials appeared to have some hesitation about Mr. Papadopoulos's outreach to Russia, but they weren't clearly opposed to it either. After receiving an email from him describing Russian desires to meet with Mr. Trump, \uc2 one campaign\uc2  official forwarded the message to another, adding, "Let[\u8216\'20\'18]s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal." The initials presumably refer to Donald Trump.\par \par \uc2 The case against Messrs. Manafort and Gates doesn't touch on the campaign itself. Instead, it alleges a wide-ranging scheme, involving foreign companies and bank accounts in countries including Cyprus and the Seychelles, to use millions of dollars in income from Ukraine in the U.S. without reporting it. As recently as October 2016, according to the indictment, Mr. Manafort's tax preparer asked him whether he had any foreign bank accounts. In response, Mr. Manafort wrote, "NONE."\par \par \uc2 According to the indictment, Mr. Manafort in fact had many such accounts, using them for varied purchases that included multimillion-dollar properties in Manhattan and Brooklyn. He then took out loans on the properties "to have the benefits of liquid income without paying taxes on it," according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 The indictment lists hundreds of purchases by Mr. Manafort dating to 2008, including more than $6.5 million on home improvement and other services in the Hamptons and in Florida; $934,000 in payments to an antique rug store in Virginia; and $849,000 in payments to a men's clothing store in New York.\par \par \uc2 Ex-Im Bank Nominee That Has Opposed Agency Faces Senate Test\par \par \uc2 By Kristina Peterson and Byron Tau\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A long-brewing fight over former Rep. Scott Garrett's candidacy to lead the Export-Import Bank, an agency he has twice voted to shut down, will come to a head this week when he testifies in front of a Senate panel reviewing his nomination.\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump's decision to nominate Mr. Garrett, a New Jersey Republican who served seven terms in the House before losing last November, has revived an internal GOP debate over the Ex-Im Bank's effectiveness. Industry groups that benefit from the agency, which provides financing for U.S. exports, are pressuring lawmakers to oppose him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, where he faces wavering support from Republicans and opposition from Democrats. Republicans hold just one more seat than Democrats on the panel and at least two Republicans\u8212\'20\'14Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Mike Rounds of South Dakota\u8212\'20\'14have signaled they are undecided. Without a majority, his nomination can't advance to the full Senate, a committee spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 "To earn my vote for this position, Mr. Garrett needs to make a clear and public statement that he will not seek to dismantle the bank and that he will support its reauthorization," Mr. Scott said, adding he would press him on the bank's future during Wednesday's hearing.\par \par \uc2 In a brief interview Monday, Mr. Rounds, who has twice met with Mr. Garrett, suggested Mr. Garrett's nomination will hinge on how he responds to senators' questions.\par \par \uc2 "At this point you can offer advice," he said. "Sometimes it's received and sometimes it's not received."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's own position on the Ex-Im Bank has meandered. He had opposed it at times during the 2016 presidential campaign, but said in an April interview with The Wall Street Journal that he would support it.\par \par \uc2 The Ex-Im Bank helps support U.S. exports through a wide range of programs, including guaranteeing loans to foreign buyers and providing credit insurance. Its charter ran out in July 2015, preventing it from conducting new business until it was renewed in December 2015 and authorized until September 2019. However, Senate Republicans haven't filled empty board seats, depriving it for the last two years of a quorum and leaving it unable to approve financing for deals of more than $10 million.\par \par \uc2 White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the administration has been preparing Mr. Garrett for his hearing.\par \par \uc2 "The administration has also been working with Sen. Tim Scott's (R-SC) office on written reassurances that Mr. Garrett will execute the president's policy to have the Ex-Im Bank fully-operational," Ms. Walters said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett went through two mock sessions last week that included staffers of Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), according to a person who was briefed on the matter. Dan Murphy, a lobbyist who has previously represented manufacturers, also attended.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Shelby's spokeswoman and Mr. Murphy didn't respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Toomey pointed to public comments from the senator, saying that advancing Mr. Garrett's nomination was important to get the bank up and running.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett is widely opposed by many in the business community, which favors renewal of the bank's charter. That has opened a rare fissure between Capitol Hill Republicans and their allies on K Street.\par \par \uc2 The National Association of Manufacturers and the Aerospace Industries Association have been among the most vocal groups. "NAM is firmly opposed to the nomination of former U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett as president of the Ex-Im Bank given his longstanding opposition to its mission and his past actions to destroy the agency," the group's chief executive, Jay Timmons, said in a letter last week to the banking panel.\par \par \uc2 The trade group has also launched an ad campaign urging voters to contact their senator to oppose Mr. Garrett's confirmation.\par \par \uc2 The Ex-Im Bank's critics view the agency as "corporate welfare" and an inappropriate interference with the market economy. Some GOP lawmakers and Democrats say the agency is necessary to keep U.S. companies competitive against foreign firms that receive similar help from their governments.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett voted against legislation reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank in 2012 and again in 2015. In an October 2015 speech, Mr. Garrett called the bank "taxpayer-funded welfare for mega corporations" and the embodiment of "the corruption of the free enterprise system."\par \par \uc2 One lobbyist for a Fortune 100 manufacturing company said the Garrett nomination had put the business community in "an impossible position." While they want to maintain a good relationship with the White House, they see Mr. Garrett as an unacceptable choice, the lobbyist said.\par \par \uc2 Heritage Action for America, the lobbying arm of the conservative think tank, supports his confirmation. A group of 27 House Republicans, including House Majority Leader \uc2 Kevin McCarthy\uc2  (R., Calif.), sent a letter in early October to the banking panel urging his confirmation.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are supportive of the bank and many are skeptical of Mr. Garrett.

The president may not have known or cared about Mr. Cordray enough to take such a major step. In a surprise revelation, the Obama appointee says the two "have never met or spoken." The statement was part of a letter Mr. Cordray sent to Mr. Trump on Monday, urging him to veto a bill approved by GOP lawmakers last week to overturn his agency's "arbitration" rule designed to make it easier for consumers to sue banks in groups. Mr. Cordray acknowledged that many thought writing the missive was a waste of time because Mr. Trump had already expressed support for the bill. But he tried to give the president a push anyway by appealing to his litigious nature.\par \par \uc2 China's Push to Lower Debt Levels Boosts Results at Big Banks\par \par \uc2 BEIJING\u8212\'20\'14China's campaign to lower debt levels boosted the third-quarter results of the country's big state-owned banks, building on a trend that has widened their advantage over smaller lenders.\par \par \uc2 To reduce risks in the financial sector, Chinese regulators this year have made it more expensive for banks to borrow from each other. That has benefited the big state banks, which use their vast retail deposit franchises to lend to other lenders, while the smaller banks have struggled with the higher funding costs.\par \par \uc2 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd\uc2 . said Monday its net profit rose 3.4% from a year earlier to 75 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in the third quarter, picking up pace from its 1.85% profit growth in the first half. In the past two years, the world's largest bank by assets reported near-flat net profit as a rapid buildup of bad loans consumed much of its earnings and narrowing interest income ate into its profitability.\par \par \uc2 Also on Monday, \uc2 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd\uc2 ., the No. 3 Chinese lender, reported net profit climbed 4.9% in the quarter, the fastest pace in the past two years. That mirrored the net profit rise that \uc2 China Construction Bank\uc2  , China's second-biggest lender by assets, posted on Friday, citing higher interest and fee income.\par \par \uc2 The only exception of the Big Four was \uc2 Bank of China Ltd\uc2 . , which only reported a 0.1% rise in profit, as it used much of its profit to lift its bad-loan provision by 63% from the year-earlier quarter.\par \par \uc2 "The Big Four banks are faring well as liquidity tightens and funding costs rise given their vast deposit bases," said Yulia Wan, a bank analyst with Moody's Investors Service. "But the banks with bigger reliance on the interbank market are under higher pressure in net interest margin."\par \par \uc2 In recent years, small Chinese banks have expanded aggressively with the help of interbank borrowing, outpacing their bigger rivals in terms of profit growth. An onslaught of regulatory measures has changed that, making it harder for them to borrow, which has slowed their expansion.\par \par \uc2 China Citic Bank\uc2  , a midsized lender based in Beijing, reported a drop in both assets\u8212\'20\'14such as loans and investments\u8212\'20\'14and liabilities, chiefly deposits, as it was forced to scale back its interbank borrowing. Other small banks, including Ping An Bank, \uc2 Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. Ltd\uc2 . and \uc2 Industrial Bank Co. Ltd\uc2 . also reported slower growth in assets.\par \par \uc2 Interest margins across China's banking industry had narrowed following a series of reductions in the benchmark interest rates to stimulate economic growth in 2014 and 2015. The liberalization of deposit rates in the past few years also forced banks into fiercer competition for depositors.\par \par \uc2 Higher market rates helped stabilize big lenders' net interest margins\u8212\'20\'14the difference between interests received and paid by banks and a key measurement of Chinese lenders' profitability. Three of the big four banks reported wider net-interest margins in the third quarter; Agricultural Bank didn't disclose the margin. Small banks' margins generally narrowed.\par \par \uc2 Also a boon to China's banks, both big and small, was the Chinese economy's better-than-expected performance this year, which helped the balance sheets at companies, especially heavily-indebted industrial ones, and made them better able to service their loans. All Big Four banks reported lower bad-loan ratios compared with the end of last year.\par \par \uc2 China's top banking regulator said on the sidelines of the Communist Party congress earlier this month that regulation will tighten further.\par \par \uc2 "The continued regulatory tightening has curtailed the reliance on market funding for these smaller banks and is expected to continue exerting pressure on their profitability in the coming years," said Moody's bank analyst Yulia Wan.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Grace Zhu\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Square Unveils Payment Terminal for Big Merchants\par \par \uc2 Square announces push to get larger merchants to start using the San Francisco-based company to process their payments.

While Mr. Quarles was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/randal-quarles-trumps-first-fed-nominee-wins-senate-approval-1507215463"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 confirmed by the full Senate about a month later}}}\uc2  and was sworn into office on Oct. 13, Mr. Otting remains in Senate limbo.\par \par \uc2 The delay comes as senators have focused on other priorities, such as the ultimately failed health-care overhaul. Much of this week's floor time, for instance, is expected to be consumed by a spate unrelated judicial nominees. But congressional aides and lobbyists expect Mr. Otting will eventually win Senate confirmation, succeeding {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.occ.treas.gov/about/who-we-are/comptroller-of-the-currency/keith-noreika.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Keith Noreika}}}\uc2 , who has served as acting comptroller since May.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett faces a rockier path.

The nomination is contentious at least in part because Mr. Garrett has repeatedly pushed to dismantle the agency he seeks to lead.\par \par \uc2 Republicans hold just one more seat than Democrats on the banking panel and at least two Republicans, Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Mike Rounds of South Dakota, have said they are undecided on Mr. Garrett. If a majority of the committee doesn't back Mr. Garrett, his nomination cannot advance to the full Senate, a committee spokeswoman said. No Democrats are expected to support him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rounds has met with Mr. Garrett twice and "he looks forward to continuing their discussion this week," a spokeswoman for the South Dakota senator said.\par \par \uc2 "In order to earn my vote for this position, Mr. Garrett needs to make a clear and public statement that he will not seek to dismantle the bank and that he will support its reauthorization," Mr. Scott said in a statement. "He will have that opportunity when he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, where I will be asking some direct and pointed questions regarding the future of the Bank."\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Day Trader Profited from Hacked Brokerage Accounts, SEC Says\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/day-trader-profited-from-hacked-brokerage-accounts-sec-says-1509397345"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A day trader based near Philadelphia}}}\uc2  earned more than $700,000 by trading against investors whose brokerage accounts had been hacked, the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  alleged in a lawsuit filed Monday.\par \par \uc2 The SEC said such account-intrusion schemes are a growing type of threat from hackers targeting ordinary investors.\par \par \uc2 The trader, Joseph Willner, used short sales and other trades to sell stocks at inflated prices and buy them at steep discounts. A hacker who Mr. Willner met online, unnamed in the complaint, gained access to the victims' accounts and purchased the stocks that Mr. Willner sold at artificially high prices, according to court records. Much of the trading took place after normal market hours, when stocks are vulnerable to wider price swings and rules that seek to ensure investors get the best price across all markets don't apply.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: The Trump Deregulatory Juggernaut Is Rolling\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trump-deregulatory-juggernaut-is-rolling-1509377716"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Why, you might ask,}}}\uc2  are the financial markets and the business community so happy with the Trump administration?\par \par \uc2 After all, a Trump presidency carries the risk of a trade war, which alarms investors and big-business leaders; in fact, the business community is actively working against the administration's threat to deep-six the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 . The GOP tax-cut plan the financial sector has been counting on is only being unveiled this week, and the administration has done nothing so far to launch the promised rebuilding of American infrastructure that business leaders crave.\par \par \uc2 To some extent, then, the explanation for the love affair lies elsewhere, in something many in Washington either find boring or overlook entirely: deregulation.\par \par \uc2 Analysis: Betting on the Next Fed Chair Often Goes Wrong\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bets-on-the-next-fed-chair-a-history-of-speculation-gone-wrong-1509389021"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 President Trump's hiring process}}}\uc2  for the Federal Reserve chair is due to end this week, and history suggests that it is tough to make money from betting on a new chairman's actions, even if you knew who it was going to be.\par \par \uc2 Political betting site PredictIt has Fed governor Jerome Powell's chances at 80%, with current Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen at 8% and academic economist John Taylor at 7%.

The banking panel announced late Monday that it would meet Wednesday to vote on the nominations of \uc2 Hester Peirce\uc2 , a Republican, and Robert Jackson, a Democrat, to fill vacancies at the five-member commission. The panel is expected to approve them, but it's unclear when the full Senate will vote on the pair.

The president may not have known or cared about Mr. Cordray enough to take such a major step. In a surprise revelation, the Obama appointee says the two "have never met or spoken." The statement was part of a letter Mr. Cordray sent to Mr. Trump on Monday, urging him to veto a bill approved by GOP lawmakers last week to overturn his agency's "arbitration" rule designed to make it easier for consumers to sue banks in groups. Mr. Cordray acknowledged that many thought writing the missive was a waste of time because Mr. Trump had already expressed support for the bill. But he tried to give the president a push anyway by appealing to his litigious nature.\par \par \uc2 China's Push to Lower Debt Levels Boosts Results at Big Banks\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-push-to-lower-debt-levels-boosts-results-at-big-banks-1509365469"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 China's campaign to lower debt levels}}}\uc2  boosted the third-quarter results of the country's big state-owned banks, building on a trend that has widened their advantage over smaller lenders.\par \par \uc2 To reduce risks in the financial sector, Chinese regulators this year have made it more expensive for banks to borrow from each other. That has benefited the big state banks, which use their vast retail deposit franchises to lend to other lenders, while the smaller banks have struggled with the higher funding costs.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-talk-daily-analysis-roundup-1509399880"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Read our compilation of concise, timely analysis}}}\uc2  by Wall Street Journal reporters. Square Unveils Payment Terminal for Big Merchants; Bitcoin Trades Above $6,000 Level; Gold More Reliable Than Cryptocurrencies\par \par \uc2 Synchronized Rate Rise\par \par \uc2 When rates start to rise, banks are typically in no rush to raise their deposit rates. After several increases, banks have to pay out more to depositors or risk seeing them leave in search of higher yields.\par \par \uc2 We have hit that point now, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-surprising-shakeout-among-banks-as-rates-rise-1509385009"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 but it is playing out in a surprising way}}}\uc2 , according to analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. So far this year, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits at big banks like \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  and \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase\uc2  has gone up by 0.18 percentage point, compared with a 0.10 increase at large regional lenders like \uc2 SunTrust Banks\uc2 , KBW calculates.\par \par \uc2 The so-called deposit beta, which measures how much banks raise their rates as a percentage of the Fed rate increase, reached 34% for universal banks in the third quarter, up from 16% in the first quarter. But large regional lenders and small banks have seen a more gentle response, with deposit betas hitting 18% and 20% respectively, in the third quarter.\par \par \uc2 Ordinarily giants like \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  are slower to raise rates, thanks to their strong brand and market positions. The difference this time is these banks have been pushing to serve wealthier clients who are more likely to move money around in search of higher yields.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday, Nov. 1\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2yeDVrs"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 vote on Securities and Exchange Commission nominees}}}\uc2 Hester Peirce\uc2  and Robert Jackson.

However, because mutual funds have to manage their own liquidity, they can demand more and stronger redemption rights, making them better able to "vote with their feet," the paper says. Mutual funds sometimes provide certification that might give them the ability to intervene with unicorns, even if they aren't legally entitled to do so, the paper says.\par \par \uc2 The Volcker Rule Can Be Fixed\par \par \uc2 There is a way to ensure banks avoid certain types of speculative trading and investing banned under the Volcker rule that doesn't require numerous metrics and multiple agencies, writes the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-27/how-to-fix-the-volcker-rule"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bloomberg editorial board}}}\uc2 .

That was the biggest annual increase since June 2014.\par \par \uc2 The 10-city index gained 5.3% over the year, up from 5.2% in July. The 20-city index gained 5.9%, up from 5.8% the previous month.\par \par \uc2 The pace of home sales has slowed in recent months, while price growth has continued to accelerate. Economists said that suggests the market is suffering from a lack of homes for sale, while demand remains strong.\par \par \uc2 Home prices are growing much faster than wages and rents, an indication that such gains are likely unsustainable.\par \par \uc2 "This is way above any other indicator in the economy," said Susan Wachter, professor of real estate at the \uc2 Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania\uc2  "It is simply the longest price increase we've every experienced of this magnitude."\par \par \uc2 Current levels of inventory of homes for sale are near their lowest point in 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Builders have struggled to keep up with increased demand for homes, as they face labor and land shortages and rising material costs. U.S. housing starts decreased in September for the fifth time in six months and remain significantly below historic norms.\par \par \uc2 Home-price gains have been widespread. Nineteen of 20 cities in the Case-Shiller indices reported price gains from July to August. Meanwhile, home prices in Seattle rose 13.2% over the last year, followed by Las Vegas with an 8.6% annual increase and San Diego with a 7.8% increases.\par \par \uc2 Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.5% in August before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city rose 0.5% and the 20-city index rose 0.4% from July to August.\par \par \uc2 After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.5% month-over-month, while the 10-city and 20-city indexes also both rose 0.5%.\par \par \uc2 Sales of previously owned homes declined on an annual basis for the first time since July 2016, that National Association of Realtors said earlier this month, a sign that the inventory shortage is taking a toll on the market. Sales fell 1.5% from the same month a year earlier.\par \par \uc2 "Home prices will not rise forever. Measures of affordability are beginning to slide, indicating that the pool of buyers is shrinking," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\par \par \uc2 Mortgage rates have begun to rise, which should ultimately begin to put a damper on price gains. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage touched 3.94% last week, up from a year earlier when it averaged 3.47%, according to \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Interest rates are starting to rise. That's generally the beginning of the end of a housing expansion," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Write to Laura Kusisto at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:laura.kusisto@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 laura.kusisto@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20171031edav000xd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 How do you learn to charm a snake?\par \par \uc2 Start with a slow, non-venomous snake. Then a slow, venomous snake. Then try a fast, non-venomous snake. Then a fast, venomous snake.\par \par \uc2 That was \uc2 Dealstruck\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s big mistake: trying to skip steps two and three. The online lender, part of a wave of fintechs that sprung up in the US between 2012 and 2014, went too big, too soon, allowing a small group of customers to over-borrow and to\u160\'00\'A0drag it down.\par \par \uc2 The company\u8217\'20\'19s rise and fall makes for a vivid and very readable memoir by its chief executive and co-founder, \uc2 Ethan Senturia\uc2  (pictured below). By the time the San Diego-based company pulled down the shutters in November 2016\u160\'00\'A0it had burned through $30m of investor capital. Fifty people lost their jobs right away; another ten or so stayed to wind down the portfolio.\par \par \uc2 Could things have turned out differently, even after the sector-wide tremors caused by the big scandal at \uc2 Lending Club\uc2 ? Perhaps. One of Mr Senturia\u8217\'20\'19s mentors and board members, Zalman Vitenson, advises against adding lines of credit to the core business of term lending, using the snake-charming analogy above.\par \par \uc2 Mr Senturia also laments another costly decision: adding a lot of subordinated debt, rather than equity, to get going. \u8220\'20\'1CAs you pile more layers of debt onto a business, what used to be the penthouse suite eventually becomes the mail room - and, our Sub Debt investors weren\u8217\'20\'19t here to lick stamps.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The bar in business books is a low one. Many great managers cannot write, or lack the humility to hire an editor. But Mr Senturia is a good companion throughout, warm and wise and witty.\par \par \uc2 Here he is on branding, for example: \u8220\'20\'1CHistorically, VCs have stayed away from financial services, especially capital-intensive businesses like lending.

"The amount of cash currently sitting on the sidelines and earning nothing is huge."\par \par \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  and \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 , the industry giants, already manage nearly $10.7tn.\par \par \uc2 But Jack Bogle, founder of \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  and pioneer of the index-based investing that has upended the fund industry, last week expressed concerns about the pace of growth.\par \par \uc2 "We are now closing in on $5tn and I worry about that," he said. "Running a large company is a very difficult thing ... It gets harder and harder as you get bigger and bigger."\par \par \uc2 PwC found that further cuts in fund fees, tougher regulation and technology will vastly intensify competitive pressures, creating new winners and losers among traditional asset managers, hedge funds and private equity groups.\par \par \uc2 "The industry will be substantially reinvented over the next 10 years. There will be major changes to fees, products, distribution, regulation, technology and people skills," said Olwyn Alexander, global asset and wealth management leader at PwC. "Fewer companies will manage far more assets significantly more cheaply."\par \par \uc2 Managers of low-cost index-tracking strategies are set to be the biggest winners, with their assets predicted to more than double from $14.2tn to $36.6tn by 2025 as awareness of the impact of fees on long-term returns increases.\par \par \uc2 "Scale is becoming increasingly important as downward pressures on fees spread from institutional clients to retail investors more widely," said Mr Linhares.\par \par \uc2 continued on page2 continued from page 1 \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  and \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  have established a commanding lead over their rivals as the two largest passive managers.\par \par \uc2 Pennsylvania-based \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  has attracted at least $1.3tn in new business since the start of 2012, while Black-Rock has registered net inflows of around $858bn over the same period.\par \par \uc2 Assets under management for \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  and \uc2 Vanguard\uc2  could reach more than $9tn and $7tn respectively by 2025, if growth for both slows to match the industry-wide annual average of 6.2 per cent expected by PwC.\par \par \uc2 This would fuel debate over whether both companies should be classified as systemically important and be subjected to tighter regulation by global supervisors.\par \par \uc2 However, growth for traditional stockpickers that attempt to identify winning stocks is expected to remain robust, with assets forecast to increase from $60.6tn to $87.6tn over the next nine years.\par \par \uc2 "It could still feel like trying to push water uphill for some active managers, as there will be intense pressures on revenues due to the continued growth in passive funds," said Justin Bates, an analyst at Liberum, the investment bank.\par \par \uc2 Asset managers have struggled to control rising costs over the past decade due to multicontinued ple demands from regulators for improvements in business practices and the need to invest in technology. This has led to pressure on profit margins in spite of healthy growth in new business inflows since the 2007-08 financial crisis, when global assets were $59tn.\par \par \uc2 "The heydays of 30 per centplus profit margins will not be sustainable in the new world order," said Ms Alexander Technologies such as \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2 , \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  offer active managers the chance to generate market-beating returns. "These technology developments offer real scope for active managers to improve alpha and to maintain their profit margins," said Mr Bates.\par \par \uc2 Additional reporting by Eric Platt\par \par \uc2 $87.6tn Predicted value of assets held by active asset managers by 2025\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171030edau00075\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

With a general election looming, the question is whether political expediency will trump business sense as sovereign fund \uc2 Khazanah Nasional\uc2 , the airline\u8217\'20\'19s owner, deals with the crisis.\par \par \uc2 Khazanah\u8217\'20\'19s management board is chaired by Prime Minister \uc2 Najib Razak\uc2 , who is himself embroiled in a scandal over the alleged mismanagement of billions of dollars at state fund \uc2 1Malaysia Development Berhad\uc2 . On October 14, thousands of people gathered on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur demanding action against Mr Najib over the 1MDB affair.\par \par \uc2 Khazanah, which embarked on a five-year restructuring of \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  in 2014, is now scrambling to contain the latest crisis, triggered by the resignation of chief executive \uc2 Peter Bellew\uc2 . It came to light on October 17 that Mr Bellew was leaving the company to rejoin budget airline \uc2 Ryanair\uc2  as chief operations officer in Ireland, his home country.\par \par \uc2 Three days later, the fund approved his replacement, choosing Izham Ismail, the carrier\u8217\'20\'19s chief operating officer and a former pilot, \u8220\'20\'1Cin line with [a] succession plan\u8221\'20\'1D outlined under the airline\u8217\'20\'19s turnround plan.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI am confident Izham will resume the turnround efforts to make \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  competitive, strong and profitable,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Najib said in a recent \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post.\par \par \uc2 As chief operating officer, Mr Izham was responsible for flight and airport operations as well as engineering.\par \par \uc2 Mr Bellew took over after his predecessor, \uc2 Christoph Mueller\uc2 , also resigned abruptly in April 2016. But Mr Bellew\u8217\'20\'19s departure is hitting harder. Although he tendered his resignation on October 8, \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  only released a statement on the matter after \uc2 Ryanair\uc2  told the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  about Mr Bellew\u8217\'20\'19s appointment in a filing on October 17.\par \par \uc2 Mr Bellew had been on administrative leave since tendering his resignation and is due to take up his new post on December 1.\par \par \uc2 The same day, an article in Malaysia\u8217\'20\'19s state-controlled New Straits Times written by the paper\u8217\'20\'19s chief executive Jalil Hamid said Mr Bellew, like Mr Mueller, had disagreed with some decisions made by Khazanah over how to run the carrier. Nine of the 16 board members at \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  are from Khazanah and other government agencies.\par \par \uc2 Khazanah responded with a statement slamming the article as \u8220\'20\'1Cerroneous and misleading\u8221\'20\'1D. It denied it was \u8220\'20\'1Cmicromanaging\u8221\'20\'1D the airline. \u8220\'20\'1CThe restructuring of \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  follows a well laid-out governance and approval framework,\u8221\'20\'1D it said. The statement did not address Mr Bellew\u8217\'20\'19s resignation directly.\par \par \uc2 Mr Bellew also denied that Khazanah had interfered in his job. \u8220\'20\'1CPeople always ask me how do I cope with government interference. There has been none for me,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Bellew said in an email to the Nikkei Asian Review on October 18. \u8220\'20\'1CAlthough possibly I drove Khazanah mad with my constant questions and wish for consensus,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 An aviation expert with more than two decades of experience, Mr Bellew said he viewed the offer from \uc2 Ryanair\uc2  as a \u8220\'20\'1Cform of national service\u8221\'20\'1D, one that he felt he could not refuse. Dublin-based \uc2 Ryanair\uc2 , Europe\u8217\'20\'19s largest airline by number of passengers, has been caught up in its own set of problems after it cancelled thousands of flights scheduled for this winter due to what it said was a problem in the scheduling of its pilots. \uc2 Michael O\u8217\'20\'19Leary\uc2 , chief executive, said Mr Bellew would be responsible for improving working conditions for pilots as part of a \u8220\'20\'1Csignificant transformation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In a statement on October 22, Mr Bellew apologised for walking away from his contract, citing family reasons as another factor in his decision.\par \par \uc2 For Khazanah, the departures of Mr Bellew and Mr Mueller are an embarrassment, given that they were \u8220\'20\'1Cglobally sourced\u8221\'20\'1D to turn the carrier round. Both had signed three-year contracts to help \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  return to profitability by the end of 2019 and subsequently refloat its shares.\par \par \uc2 Khazanah did not mention any of Mr Bellew\u8217\'20\'19s contributions in announcing the new Malaysia Airlines chief executive. In a similar announcement last year, it thanked Mr Mueller for his \u8220\'20\'1Cinstrumental contribution\u8221\'20\'1D to the restructuring efforts.\par \par \uc2 Khazanah took the carrier private at the end of 2014 in the aftermath of two disasters that hammered the airline\u8217\'20\'19s shares and reputation. Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 and is yet to be found, and Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine in July that year.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  was struggling with high costs and making losses even before the twin tragedies. In the 2014 recovery plan, Khazanah said the airline\u8217\'20\'19s operational costs were much higher than those of its peers and instructed the new management under Mr Mueller to cut 6,000 staff from the total workforce of 20,000. Recently, Mr Bellew said the airline was on the brink of profitability.\par \par \uc2 A bloated workforce is one of the most difficult inefficiencies to tackle at state-controlled enterprises, which have the added social responsibility of providing jobs. Managing such companies \u8212\'20\'14 whose employees tend to form the bedrock of support for the ruling government \u8212\'20\'14 can be a tricky task, even for industry veterans such as Mr Mueller and Mr Bellew, who once called it the \u8220\'20\'1Ctoughest job in aviation\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 But tough is exactly what the next boss of \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  must be. Aviation analysts say that in addition to expert management, the company needs freedom from government influence.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe airline is beyond rehabilitation and saving until and unless certain hard-nosed decisions are made,\u8221\'20\'1D said Shukor Yusof, an industry veteran who runs his own consulting company Endau \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CThat means the immediate removal of those who are incompetent and inept.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  is also fighting a reputation for substandard service. Its \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page is regularly flooded with comments complaining of poor customer service, flight cancellations and its unwieldy mobile site.\par \par \uc2 The repeated turnover at the top \u8212\'20\'14 three chief executives in three years \u8212\'20\'14 makes the already challenging turnround even more difficult to achieve, said Brendan Sobie, an analyst at the Sydney-based Centre for Aviation.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, one local analyst said the carrier was showing signs of progress in its restructuring thanks to the two foreign executives doing the \u8220\'20\'1Cdirty work\u8221\'20\'1D of getting rid of inefficiencies.\par \par \uc2 The government, Mr Shukor said, is answerable to taxpayers for the \u8220\'20\'1Cdeep rut\u8221\'20\'1D the carrier is in despite having spent $1.42bn to bail it out.\par \par \uc2 The trouble at \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  stands out all the more when compared with compatriot \uc2 AirAsia\uc2 . The budget airline founded by entrepreneur \uc2 Tony Fernandes\uc2  carried 15.8m passengers in the second quarter of this year, compared with \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19 3.6m. \uc2 AirAsia\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s load factor, a key indicator of airline performance, stood at 88 per cent for the quarter versus 77. 8 per cent for its state-owned counterpart.\par \par \uc2 With the country due to go to the polls by August 2018, government interference in state companies such as \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  is unlikely to let up.\par \par \uc2 In one recent example, Mr Najib stepped in to sort out a boardroom tussle at \uc2 Felda Global Ventures\uc2 , removing the chairman of the palm plantation company for alleged corruption.\par \par \uc2 FGV is controlled by the \uc2 Federal Land Development Authority\uc2 , which provides support for more than 100,000 farming households through handouts in the form of subsidised fertiliser and low-interest loans. This support has helped ensure the ruling party\u8217\'20\'19s popularity in rural constituencies.\par \par \uc2 In at least one case, however, desperation has led to a more hands-off management approach. Earlier this year, the government approved the sale of a 49.9 per cent stake in \uc2 Proton Holdings\uc2  to China\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 Zhejiang Geely Holding Group\uc2  to bail out the lossmaking national carmaker. It also had no objection to the appointment of Chinese national Li Chunrong as Proton\u8217\'20\'19s new chief and said the partnership with Geely was a \u8220\'20\'1Ccommercial decision\u8221\'20\'1D on the part of the seller, DRB-Hicom.\par \par \uc2 Khazanah owned a majority stake in Proton before divesting it in 2012 to DRB-Hicom in hopes that the local automobile conglomerate could turn it round.\par \par \uc2 Lacking economies of scale, Proton has for years suffered from the widespread perception that its vehicles are of poor quality. Sales have steadily declined, and today the company controls only about 14 per cent of the domestic market, even though its cars are priced lower than its competitors thanks to preferential treatment.\par \par \uc2 In the case of \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2 , the stakes are even higher. Mr Najib promised US president \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  in a visit to Washington in September that Malaysia would step up investment in America. Mr Bellew then announced during the trip that \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  would buy eight wide-body 787 Dreamliners made by Boeing of the US.\par \par \uc2 Former Malaysian prime minister \uc2 Mahathir Mohamad\uc2  said Mr Bellew\u8217\'20\'19s departure was caused by Mr Najib\u8217\'20\'19s instructing the company to place the aircraft order to please Mr Trump, an allegation that Mr Bellew said is \u8220\'20\'1C100 per cent incorrect\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 How Khazanah handles the awkwardness created by Mr Bellew\u8217\'20\'19s sudden exit will have an impact not only the airline itself. After all, as Mr Najib said in his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post, \uc2 Malaysia Airlines\uc2  is not just any carrier. It carries the name, image and brand of the country in the skies. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is our pride.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A version of this article was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on October 26. \u169\'00\'A92017 \uc2 Nikkei Inc\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 Pro Private Markets\par {\*\bkmkstart toc75}{\*\bkmkend toc75}\b \uc2 Private Equity Analyst's 2017 Women to Watch: Venture Capital\b0\par\par\uc2 By Alexander Davis, Brian Gormley, Cat Zakrzewski, Heather Mack, Yuliya Chernova and Tomio Geron \par \uc2 2,367 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2017\par 13:34\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Private Equity\par \uc2 RSTPROPE\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 This year has been marked by soul searching about sexism in the venture-capital industry. Waves of headlines about sexual misconduct among venture capitalists have only underscored the industry's shortcomings in diversity and shed light on the importance of having strong women in influential leadership positions.\par \par \uc2 The good news is that a high-achieving cadre of women has answered the call over the years and continues to make strides as investors at firms large and small, old and new.\par \par \uc2 In the latest installment of our second Women to Watch series, Private Equity Analyst profiles eight female influencers in the industry.\par \par \uc2 KATE CASTLE\par \par \uc2 Marketing Partner, \uc2 Flybridge Capital Partners\uc2  Operating Partner, XFactor Ventures\par \par \uc2 In her junior year at Wheaton College, Kate Castle spent a semester in Indonesia, where she linked up with a nonprofit that made microloans to women looking to start their own businesses. That project became a passion and foreshadowed her current role with XFactor Ventures, a $3 million fund unveiled in July with plans to back 30 startups with female founders. In the process, the firm hopes to draw more women into a startup ecosystem currently dominated by men. "I have an attitude [that] there's always a fix for something," Ms. Castle said. She began her career in public relations before taking marketing roles with Battery Ventures and IDG Ventures Boston, which rebranded as \uc2 Flybridge Capital Partners\uc2  in 2008. Today she is marketing partner of Flybridge and co-founder of XFactor along with Flybridge's \uc2 Chip Hazard\uc2  and Anna Palmer, co-founder and chief executive officer of startup Wondermile. XFactor, whose investment partners include eight female startup founders, targets pain points facing women on the fundraising trail. Securing a first check is a tough task, and slow investment decisions make it even tougher. XFactor makes decisions within three weeks. As an XFactor operating partner, a position similar to her role with Flybridge, Ms. Castle filters entrepreneurs to the appropriate investment partner, connects companies with resources and handles the firm's marketing. XFactor's efforts could bring more diversity to startups, but a variety of solutions are needed to solve the problem of too few women receiving venture funding, according to Ms. Castle, 46. "There isn't a silver bullet for how we do this," she said.\par \par \uc2 KIRSTEN GREEN\par \par \uc2 General Partner, \uc2 Forerunner Ventures\par \par \uc2 It doesn't take more than a glance at the team roster of \uc2 Forerunner Ventures\uc2  to see what makes the San Francisco firm different from other venture-capital firms: Almost all of the partners are women. "Given all the conversations about the problems in the industry, I'm really proud of the diversity of our team," said \uc2 Kirsten Green\uc2 , 45, who added the investing partners also range three decades in age and hail from different parts of the country. "Those varied perspectives are what give us vision and an exemplified business lens." That foundational belief is what helped Forerunner, which Ms. Green founded in 2003, to scout some of the most successful retail startups of the past few years. The firm was an early backer of businesses that yielded some of the largest exits in the realm of online retail in the last 18 months. \uc2 Jet.com Inc\uc2 . was acquired by \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 . for about $3.3 billion, and \uc2 Unilever\uc2  bought Dollar Shave Club Inc. for $1 billion. Ms. Green also occupies several board seats at startups including beauty-product company Glossier Inc. and the recently acquired online men's clothier \uc2 Bonobos Inc\uc2 . She attributes her track record with early-stage companies that strike a chord with consumers to her own experience watching the evolution of commerce. Previously, she worked at places including private-equity firm \uc2 TSG Consumer Partners\uc2 , \uc2 Banc of America Securities LLC\uc2  and Deloitte, before the burgeoning online shopping ecosystem drew her into the venture world.\par \par \uc2 PAULINA HILL\par \par \uc2 Principal, Polaris Partners\par \par \uc2 Paulina Hill majored in four subjects at \uc2 East Carolina University\uc2  while also captaining the women's tennis team\u8212\'20\'14a fitting preparation for her work at Polaris Partners, where she backs a diverse group of biomedical startups. As a principal in the Boston office of Polaris, Dr. Hill works with drugmakers such as \uc2 Kala Pharmaceuticals Inc\uc2 ., which went public in July, and medical-technology businesses such as \uc2 Neuronetics Inc\uc2 ., and last year helped launch Marauder Therapeutics, a biotechnology company the firm seeded. An investment career wasn't what she had in mind while studying biology, biochemistry, chemistry and neuroscience at East Carolina, nor while she was earning a Ph.D. in molecular medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. But she did know she wanted to transform academic discoveries into disease treatments\u8212\'20\'14a desire that led her, after a postdoctoral fellowship at the \uc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\uc2 , to join Polaris in 2012. Polaris, which launches and invests in startups, affords her the opportunity to employ her scientific expertise as she evaluates medical discoveries and helps create companies to develop them. Marauder uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and the new science of gene control to identify novel drug targets and therapeutics. Dr. Hill, 35, until recently was Marauder's CEO. Now she is exploring new prospects in fields of interest to her, including women's health, where she sees significant medical needs and improving innovation. "I want to work with smart people on cool things," she said. "And I get to do that every day."\par \par \uc2 SHADI MEHRAEIN\par \par \uc2 General Partner, Rivet Ventures\par \par \uc2 Shadi Mehraein has an extensive background in venture investing. Now she is building her own firm. Rivet Ventures targets women-focused markets and consumers, an area often overlooked in the male-dominated venture world. It is investing out of its first $15 million fund. San Francisco-based Rivet is one of a handful of venture firms started in recent years by female investors. Ms. Mehraein, 34, is a general partner at Rivet along with Rebeca Hwang, who was co-founder of startup YouNoodle Inc. Two other partners are Christina Brodbeck, a founding designer at YouTube and angel investor; and \uc2 Stephanie Tilenius\uc2 , a former \uc2 Google\uc2  executive who has done an executive-in-residence stint at \uc2 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\uc2 . Previously, Ms. Mehraein was with growth-stage firm \uc2 Focus Ventures\uc2 , where she worked on investments in startups including \uc2 BookRenter\uc2 , \uc2 Delivery Agent\uc2 , \uc2 Marin Software Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 PCH International\uc2 . Before that, she was at \uc2 Bessemer Venture Partners\uc2 , working on areas such as e-commerce, software as a service, gaming and digital media. Rivet focuses on female consumers and markets, though it invests in male and female founders, and also could target deals in sectors such as health, education and social media. Ms. Mehraein has seen firsthand the challenges facing female founders. "It is fairly safe to say that both female entrepreneurs and investors are often held to a different, if not higher, standard when fundraising," she said. One way to change that, she said, is to have more women as venture investors, adding, "We would like to see more money go to female GPs because it all trickles down."\par \par \uc2 RENATA QUINTINI\par \par \uc2 Partner, \uc2 Lux Capital\par \par \uc2 Last year wasn't too shabby for Renata Quintini. Two of her portfolio companies, self-driving car technology developer Cruise Automation Inc. and e-commerce startup Dollar Shave Club, were picked up in billion-dollar acquisitions by strategic buyers. In February 2017, Ms. Quintini left \uc2 Felicis Ventures\uc2 , where she was general partner, to become a partner at \uc2 Lux Capital\uc2  to focus exclusively on science-based technology investments. "It's a pure play," Ms. Quintini said about Lux and why she decided to join the firm. "I wanted to spend 100% of my time helping build the cutting edge." At Lux, Ms. Quintini, 38, is focusing on early-stage startups solving problems in food, whether it is materials that help store food longer or vertical farming that gets healthier food to consumers. She is looking at technology for older people, who, Ms. Quintini said, are an expanding demographic that deserves as much attention as millennials from the technology sector. She also is paying attention to fertility. Robotics and automation remain interests as well. At Lux, Ms. Quintini has made one investment, backing Common Networks Inc., a provider of wireless networks for suburban communities. It is a complicated business, Ms. Quintini said, that involves the development of software and hardware, as well as the logistics of rolling out a truck to people's homes. "It's a multidisciplinary problem," and that, she said, is the type of business that excites her. Ms. Quintini first became aware of venture capital as a lawyer in Brazil, where some of her clients were venture investors, she said. She came to the U.S. and received a master's degree in business administration at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 . That led her to work at the \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  endowment, where she interacted with many venture investors, including a wave of micro-venture-capital funds, which, in turn, led Ms. Quintini to join Felicis. She said that increasing the number of diverse voices in venture capital and startups is crucial. "Tech has a little bit of an empathy problem," Ms. Quintini said, adding that some startup investments are out of touch with the problems many people face or sometimes, even, may hurt people. "Cognitive diversity" would help technologists avoid problems and understand society better, she said.\par \par \uc2 KRISTINA SHEN\par \par \uc2 Partner, \uc2 Bessemer Venture Partners\par \par \uc2 Kristina Shen\uc2  says she isn't much into self-promotion. But her \uc2 Bessemer Venture Partners\uc2  colleagues who pushed her to take more risks in boosting her brand seem to have proven she is up to the challenge. Her feet may be on the ground, but her head is very much in the cloud. Learning to overcome her reticence and aversion to public speaking, she now is considered to be one of the venture-capital industry's foremost experts on the cloud computing market, along with her Bessemer mentor Byron Deeter. And her rise to the forefront didn't take long. Ms. Shen graduated college in 2009, then worked in investment banking before making the leap into venture capital. She worked at JMI Equity before joining Bessemer in 2013. "I'm a data nerd," she said. "Numbers make sense to me." Together with Mr. Deeter, Ms. Shen is the author of Bessemer's annual "State of the Cloud," an authoritative look at the top trends in the market and a scoreboard about who is up and who is down in what has become a dominant area of business for today's venture-backed companies. Ms. Shen, 30, has helped lead Bessemer investments into startups using cloud-based platforms that cover a variety of business productivity and marketing segments. She is involved with the boards of businesses including Buildscale Inc., a video provider for marketers that does business as Vidyard; ServiceTitan Inc., which is used by service technicians and other contractors in the field; and, her proudest investment, \uc2 Glint Inc\uc2 ., a human-resources tool for employee engagement. Ms. Shen helped lead a $37 Series C round in Glint last year. New pressure on the industry to combat sexism and boost diversity is welcome news to Ms. Shen. She said venture capitalists must work on all levels to counter unconscious bias, adding investors too often inadequately evaluate founders because they fall back on superficial pattern recognition. "I'm glad it's a hot topic," she said. "It's getting much-needed attention."\par \par \uc2 LISA SUENNEN\par \par \uc2 Senior Managing Director, GE Ventures\par \par \uc2 Privately held health-care companies may have slightly better representation of women leaders than do businesses in the technology space or other areas of investment, but Lisa Suennen of \uc2 GE Ventures\uc2  says she sees more than enough room for improvement, and she was determined to do something about it. To encourage more women to enter executive roles, Ms. Suennen last year co-founded a not-for-profit program called CSweetener. The group pairs rising professional women with established mentors\u8212\'20\'14both female and male alike. Ms. Suennen, senior managing director of health-care investing at \uc2 GE Ventures\uc2 , said since its inception, CSweetener has drawn hundreds of participants, both mentors and mentees. "I had a responsibility to do what I could do. I appreciate that people do things like researching the problem and publishing reports and making statements, but it's much more interesting to take action," said Ms. Suennen, 51. "I had a platform to be able to act." In addition to working on leadership issues, she is a well-known voice inside the health-care industry. Ms. Suennen focuses on the intersection of health-care information technology and services and sits on the boards of several companies, including Evidation Health Inc. and Gravie Inc. On top of all that, Ms. Suennen is managing partner of media publishing business Venture Valkyrie LLC, where she writes a popular blog and co-produces a podcast called Tech Tonics. Previously, Ms. Suennen spent about 15 years at health care-focused firm Psilos Group Managers. She also lectures on health-care investing and the evolving health-care economy at the \uc2 University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SARAH TAVEL\par \par \uc2 General Partner, Benchmark\par \par \uc2 As Benchmark's newest partner, Sarah Tavel has met with a few hundred entrepreneurs since joining the firm in May. A former investor at \uc2 Greylock Partners\uc2  and former \uc2 Pinterest Inc\uc2 . product lead, Ms. Tavel is known for her focus on consumer technology. But since joining Benchmark, Ms. Tavel, 35, has been spending more time on cryptocurrency startups. Though she hasn't yet announced any investments in her new role, Ms. Tavel is bullish on bitcoin's potential. She does warn that the crypto industry is in a bubble when it comes to its frenzy of fundraising via initial coin offerings. Since joining Benchmark, Ms. Tavel has joined HMFDF Inc., which does business as Solv Health, as a board observer and also has visited with other Benchmark portfolio companies, such as \uc2 Glassdoor Inc\uc2 . and HackerOne. "Every meeting, I walk away with an insight or a way of thinking about our business that we didn't have before," Heather Fernandez, Solv's CEO, said of Ms. Tavel.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20171030edau000e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 HONG KONG -- Flush with cash, Chinese financial-technology firm \uc2 Ant Financial Services Group\uc2  is putting on hold plans for an initial public offering while it steps up investments in everything from startups to \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , according to a senior company executive.\par \par \uc2 Ant, which was founded by billionaire \uc2 Jack Ma\uc2  and born out of a spinoff from \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 ., has quietly grown into one of the world's most valuable fintech companies. Its biggest asset is Alipay, a mobile-payments platform used on Alibaba's e-commerce sites and by hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers to pay for everything from meals to college tuition fees.\par \par \uc2 Investors and analysts have been expecting Ant to go public sometime in 2018. The company last raised $4.5 billion from private investors in April 2016 in a deal that gave it a $60 billion valuation -- and its business has since expanded significantly.\par \par \uc2 An IPO "is not a necessity or a priority" right now, said Douglas Feagin, Ant's president of international business, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in Hong Kong.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Feagin, an American who was a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment banker for more than two decades, said he can appreciate the benefits of going public but Ant has other, more pressing, plans to implement.\par \par \uc2 Among Ant's pursuits: expanding Alipay's global footprint within and beyond the 70 countries the payments system is used in, while plumbing for new technology investments globally in things like facial-recognition and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine-learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  systems.\par \par \uc2 "It is the time now to deploy \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  in ways that are much more sophisticated than we've ever done: The technology is there, the data is there, [as is] the receptivity of consumers," Mr. Feagin said.\par \par \uc2 He declined to detail exactly how much Ant plans to invest, but pointed to affiliate Alibaba's plans to spend more than $15 billion over three years on research and development.\par \par \uc2 Ant has, in the past three years, invested more than $16 billion in more than 50 startups that include online lenders, insurers and technology firms, according to database ITjuzi.\par \par \uc2 The company led a $40 million financing round announced Tuesday for DeePhi Tech, a Beijing-based startup that creates applications for "\b \highlight22\uc2 deep learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 ," a technology that teaches computers to differentiate data the way a human brain does.\par \par \uc2 As a closely held business, Ant doesn't disclose its financial results publicly. But data from Alibaba -- to which Ant pays fixed royalties and fees under a profit-sharing agreement -- indicate Ant's pretax profit reached $773 million in the quarter ended in June. That is close to Ant's profit for its entire previous fiscal year ended in March, which rose 86% from a year earlier to $814 million, according to Alibaba filings.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts expect the company to go public eventually. "\uc2 Ant Financial\uc2 's strategy is to defend share, grow into new areas and generate profits -- leading to the business becoming 'IPO-ready' in 2018," said \uc2 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co\uc2 . research analyst Bhavtosh Vajpayee.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20171028000097"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020171028edas0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

A line on a chart in a previous version of this article misstated the GDP-growth level by about 2 percentage points between 1990 and 2017. (Oct. 28)\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The U.S. economy posted its best six-month stretch of growth in three years despite two hurricanes, a sign that it might be breaking out of its long-running slow-growth trend, with the help of soaring stock prices and rising business and consumer confidence.\par \par \uc2 Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the U.S., expanded at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. That followed 3.1% annual growth in the spring.\par \par \uc2 Though not a boom, that's still the first time since mid-2014 that the economy has strung together two quarters of at least 3% growth. Solid spending by consumers and businesses\u8212\'20\'14along with higher sales of American goods overseas\u8212\'20\'14helped prevent the kind of slowdown some economists expected after hurricanes Harvey and Irma shut down parts of Texas and Florida in August and September.\par \par \uc2 The third-quarter gain came alongside signals that "animal spirits," as the economist John Maynard Keynes once described the desire to spend and invest, were helping to boost economic activity. Stock-market gains have accelerated since Donald Trump was elected president last year, and both consumer and small-business confidence have notched higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose another 33 points Friday, putting it up 18.4% so far this year.\par \par \uc2 In the wake of those sentiment advances, household purchases of durable goods, such as cars and refrigerators, have picked up, as have gains in business investment in equipment. Consumer spending on durable goods rose at an 8.3% annual rate in the third quarter after 7.6% annual growth in the previous quarter. Equipment spending by business rose at an annual 8.6%, following 8.8% in the previous quarter.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Wilson, chief executive and president of Buzz Franchise Brands, a pest-control and home-cleaning company, said higher stocks have led several people to open franchises under his brands this year.\par \par \uc2 "Good times are here," he said. "Their stocks have gone up and they're taking some of that money and saying now's the opportunity to start our own business."\par \par \uc2 Still, there is ample reason for caution before concluding the gains will be sustained. The economy has produced six-month growth bursts several times during this eight-year expansion, including a period of near-5% growth in mid-2014. But it hasn't been able to keep up that pace. The growth rate as a whole for the expansion has averaged 2.2%.\par \par \uc2 A chunk of the third quarter's growth reflected businesses' replenishing of stockpiles, which had fallen earlier this year, rather than higher sales. Stripping out inventory changes, which can be volatile, output grew at a 2.3% rate, closer to the longer-running average. Compared with a year earlier, overall output including inventory changes was just 2.3% higher.\par \par \uc2 While economists are expecting growth in the current quarter to clock near 3% again, nagging trends, including an aging population and weak worker productivity gains, still might stand in the way of the country achieving sustained robust economic growth.\par \par \uc2 "We have to be a little bit careful," said Gregory Daco, economist at Oxford Economics. "The underlying pace still remains in that 2% growth environment."\par \par \uc2 President Donald Trump has promised sustained 3% growth by reducing regulations, revamping trade agreements and passing a broad tax-cut package currently being negotiated in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials celebrated the latest numbers. "As the President's tax-cut plan is implemented, our entire economy will continue to come roaring back," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Friday.\par \par \uc2 Democrats weren't prepared to yield any credit to the new administration. "Today's GDP numbers show the resiliency of the economy this administration inherited," Sen. Martin Heinrich (D., N.M) said in a statement. "Instead of building on this foundation, President Trump has created a climate of uncertainty."\par \par \uc2 Hurricanes made it challenging to discern the underlying trend in the third quarter. Damage to property led to a spurt of spending on cars in hurricane-damaged areas, but the storms also appear to have depressed spending on services like restaurants, where payrolls sank for the month.\par \par \uc2 The Commerce Department said hurricanes likely suppressed business activity such as oil-and-gas extraction in Texas and agricultural production in Florida. But the storms likely boosted other types of activity, such as emergency services and repair efforts.\par \par \uc2 "It is not possible to estimate the overall impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on 2017 third-quarter GDP," the agency said.\par \par \uc2 Repair efforts could boost economic growth in coming quarters, particularly in building sectors. The Commerce Department estimated that government and private insurance companies' payouts resulting from the storms could total $102 billion. That's money that could be plowed back into the economy.\par \par \uc2 Taken altogether, the report is likely to nudge the Federal Reserve closer to raising its benchmark short-term interest rate\u8212\'20\'14the federal funds rate\u8212\'20\'14at its policy meeting in December. Inflation picked up this summer after weakening earlier in the year, though it remains below the Fed's 2% target. The price index for personal consumption expenditures\u8212\'20\'14the Fed's preferred measure of inflation\u8212\'20\'14rose at a 1.5% annual rate in the third quarter, up from the second quarter's 0.3% increase.\par \par \uc2 If the economy is going to sustain faster growth, much will depend on the outlook for business investment, which is central to boosting worker productivity and sustaining robust corporate profit gains.\par \par \uc2 MBAF, a 600-employee accounting and consulting firm in based in Miami, offered a sign that a sustainable pickup is happening. It has budgeted roughly $1 million in capital spending in its current fiscal year\u8212\'20\'14triple the amount it spent last year.\par \par \uc2 Tony Argiz, the firm's chief executive and chairman, said the spending increase reflects two developments: New technology has come on the market recently enabling his company to perform audits much more efficiently, and breaches at firms like Equifax are pushing firms like his to invest in new security software.\par \par \uc2 He said the company feels the urge to become more efficient to compete with other firms. "We need to keep up with the times, and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  is going to be critical in my profession in the next four or five years," Mr. Argiz said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Josh Mitchell at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:joshua.mitchell@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 joshua.mitchell@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 More on the Economy\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2017/10/27/3-third-quarter-u-s-growth-at-a-glance/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Third-Quarter GDP At a Glance}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2017/10/27/economists-react-to-the-third-quarter-gdp-report-theres-nothing-to-complain-about/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Economists React: \u8216\'20\'18There's Nothing to Complain About'}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-sentiment-in-october-hit-its-highest-level-since-2004-1509114057?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Consumer Sentiment Hits Highest Level Since 2004}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ecb-and-fed-are-growing-apart-moving-markets-1509080401?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ECB, Fed Are Growing Apart, Moving Markets}}}\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\jpegblip\picw640\pich238\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal9600\pichgoal3570

Mr von Koskull said total costs would be \u8364\'20\'AC4.9bn next year and would only fall below \u8364\'20\'AC4.8bn by 2021.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Unions reacted strongly to the job losses. \u8220\'20\'1CIt is absolutely incomprehensible that you cut every eighth job at the same time as presenting a net profit for the first nine months of \u8364\'20\'AC2.4bn,\u8221\'20\'1D said Kent Pedersen, head of the financial services union in Denmark.\par \par \uc2 He added that \uc2 Nordea\uc2  was following a \u8220\'20\'1Cvery strict focus on shareholders\u8221\'20\'1D at the expense of workers.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Investors begged to differ, sending \uc2 Nordea\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s shares down by 6 per cent to SKr101.4.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The bank has invested heavily in digital services in what it portrays as an attempt to focus more on customer service. It started deploying a customer service chatbot in Norway that has so far answered about 10,000 customer questions. In December, it will launch an online robot adviser that can give investments and savings advice.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The news on job cuts comes amid a big upheaval at the bank, which has risen to become one of the most valuable banks in Europe after relatively successfully weathering the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 It plans to move its headquarters and a handful of jobs from Stockholm to Helsinki next year in part to escape \u8364\'20\'AC1bn in regulatory fees. But some investors think that by joining the eurozone and its banking union it may be looking for takeover deals in the future.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Nordea\uc2  also announced third-quarter results that were largely in line with analysts\u8217\'20\'19 expectations. Operating profit was \u8364\'20\'AC1.09bn versus last year\u8217\'20\'19s \u8364\'20\'AC1.15bn.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171026edaq006hd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Isaac and Ken Rees \par \uc2 866 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 October 2017\par 00:05\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This month the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  issued new rules likely to curtail payday and title loans. On the same day, the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  removed its ban on short-term subprime lending by banks. Now some banks are sorting through ways to help meet demand for these loans.\par \par \uc2 These changes come amid turbulent times for millions of Americans. Average savings have dropped to less than 5% of income today from around 13% in the 1970s, according to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis}}}\uc2 . A 2016 \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  report estimates nearly half of Americans would not be able to muster $400 for an emergency. Making matters worse, according to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-evolution-of-household-income-volatility-3/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Brookings Institution}}}\uc2 , income volatility has risen 30% since 1971. Access to credit has become an essential tool for millions of people dealing with unexpected expenses and income shortfalls.\par \par \uc2 Banks have also undergone dramatic changes. Automated credit scoring systems have replaced local loan officers, who once made credit decisions based on bank statements, income assessments, community connections and character. These technologies penalize those without pristine credit histories. Regulatory pressures have made the situation worse, forcing banks to curtail lending to the people most in need of it while battling for the relatively small pool of affluent customers.\par \par \uc2 To regain the trust and business of working-class Americans, bankers and their regulators must encourage innovations that help the underserved. With new leadership coming to the federal banking agencies, we offer five important insights:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 America is a nonprime nation. An astounding two-thirds of Americans have a nonprime credit score (below 700) or no score at all, according to the Corporation for Enterprise Development and FICO. Due to high credit-score requirements, some 160 million Americans find it difficult or impossible to access traditional bank credit. The way for banks to grow and better serve their communities is to figure out how to lend again, safely and profitably, to a much broader range of customers. Banks need a new generation of nonprime credit products.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Nonprime customer needs differ greatly from prime customers. Traditional bank credit products haven't really changed much in recent decades. Banks assume a customer is willing to come to a branch, fill out an application, provide paperwork, and then wait for a decision.\par \par \uc2 Nonprime customers' need for credit is far more urgent. The top five reasons for selecting a lender are "Solve Financial Need," "Fast and Easy," "Money Quick," "No Hidden Fees" and "Few Documents," according to the Center for the New Middle Class. "Lowest APR" was listed as a top three reason by less than 1 out of 5 non-prime customers.\par \par \uc2 It is not enough to provide credit for consumers' immediate needs. Banks need to be fully committed to improving the financial wellness of their customers through credit building and personal-finance training.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Traditional underwriting approaches don't work. Although FICO scores do a good job of identifying the overall riskiness of customers within different bands of credit scores, they are only minimally predictive for underwriting nonprime consumers. Prime lenders look for customers with pristine credit and typically turn down anyone with a limited credit history or derogatory credit information.\par \par \uc2 Lending to nonprime customers requires new, targeted credit scores built around specific types of consumers, often using alternative data sources and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  techniques. Regulators should support technology-based innovation in underwriting.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Nonprime lending can be less risky than prime lending. The real risk in consumer lending stems from changes in the economic environment. Perhaps surprisingly, this is where nonprime lending is actually less volatile. During the Great Recession, charge-off rates for personal loans to prime credit customers increased by a higher percentage than nonprime loans, according to data from the credit reporting firm \uc2 TransUnion\uc2 . Changes in the broader business cycle influence prime customers more than nonprime customers, who are used to dealing with financial pressures.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Fintech innovators are not the enemy. Most banks outsource the technology used in branch systems and for support of their core products. Fintech innovators should be encouraged to work with banks, not compete against them.\par \par \uc2 Banks have funding and compliance advantages, and banks already have financial relationships with the majority of Americans. But most banks will have difficulty matching the agility and analytical savvy of the fintech industry. Regulators should be receptive to joint ventures between banks and technology firms.\par \par \uc2 An outdated regulatory environment, fueled by misperceptions about nonprime lending, has resulted in greater risks for banks and their customers. Loss of market share and profitable sources of income has weakened banks, and consumers are hurt by being driven to more expensive nonbank lenders. The incoming leadership at the federal banking agencies has an opportunity to help banks re-emerge as the lender of choice to tens of millions of working Americans.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Isaac, a financial consultant, was chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (1981-85) and of \uc2 Fifth Third Bancorp\uc2  (2010-14). Mr. Rees is CEO of the online lender Elevate.\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171026edaq00914\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 An earlier version of this article contained a misspelling of Cameron Feenstra's surname in a caption. (Oct. 26, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Managing a generation of young people inclined to share relationship statuses and meal photos on social media requires employers to adjust the way they approach compensation, experts say.\par \par \uc2 "Pay and promotions are not secretive topics anymore," says Mary Ann Sardone, who consults with large employers on compensation issues and leads the workforce-rewards practice at benefits consultant Mercer, a unit of \uc2 Marsh & McLennan Cos\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Companies are spending more time ensuring their pay decisions are fair, and highlighting career paths under the assumption that the information is going to be widely shared," she says.\par \par \uc2 Roughly a third of U.S. workers ages 18 to 36 say they feel comfortable discussing pay with their co-workers, more than any other age group and about four times the rate among baby boomers, ages 53 to 71, according to a survey of 1,000 employees conducted by personal finance firm \uc2 Bankrate Inc\uc2 .'s TheCashlorette.com. Nearly half of the millennials surveyed say they talk about compensation with their friends, compared with 36% of Americans overall.\par \par \uc2 When Cameron Feenstra received a job offer this summer from Prattle \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , a St. Louis-based research firm, the first thing the 22-year-old did was call his sister. Although he was willing to take a below-market salary for the chance to work at a fast-growing startup, Mr. Feenstra wanted to ensure that his offer of $42,000 was a fair annual salary for his role as a junior quantitative analyst.\par \par \uc2 After talking about salaries with friends and family, and consulting anonymous career and salary-sharing websites such as Glassdoor, Mr. Feenstra decided to negotiate for more money, even though it was his first real job in the field.\par \par \uc2 "People who don't ask around never learn how to negotiate, because they don't know where everyone else is" in terms of salary as a reference point, Mr. Feenstra says. He got a pay bump to $45,000 before accepting the offer.\par \par \uc2 The attitude shift has put greater pressure on employers to explain why some workers are paid more than others and to formalize compensation and promotion practices, says Kristina Launey, a partner at law firm \uc2 Seyfarth Shaw LLP\uc2 , which specializes in labor and employment issues.\par \par \uc2 A {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cities-push-employers-to-ignore-pay-history-1492254003"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rash of new city and state ordinances}}}\uc2  in Philadelphia, New York City and Massachusetts bar hiring managers from asking job candidates about their salary history, pressuring companies to be more transparent about what they are willing to pay for many roles.\par \par \uc2 Bill MacMillan, Prattle co-founder and chief technology officer, says he is accustomed to requests like Mr. Feenstra's. But keeping the 19-person startup on good financial footing while offering competitive-enough salaries to retain talented workers is a delicate balance, he adds.\par \par \uc2 "I have great people, so I would love to pay them lots and lots of money," says Mr. MacMillan. Instead, he says, the firm explains to job seekers that while their salary may start at a below-market level, their performance and pay will typically be reviewed at least twice a year\u8212\'20\'14at which point he and other managers can be "aggressive" with raises for top performers.\par \par \uc2 Since Mr. Feenstra began working at Prattle, he has discussed his pay with several of his colleagues. The chats have given him an idea of what to expect when discussing future raises, such as when his boss reviews his performance later this year.\par \par \uc2 Write to Kelsey Gee at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:kelsey.gee@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 kelsey.gee@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171025edap001p6\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Margins continue to fall worldwide.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 McKinsey said the total upside for banks that embrace technology was worth $700bn of extra income by 2025. But it said that some banks were unlikely to make the necessary changes and some of the gains would be \u8220\'20\'1Ccompeted away\u8221\'20\'1D, so it reduced its estimate of the likely gains to $350bn, which would translate into a return on equity of 7.7 per cent by 2025.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171025edap0060q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Big U.S. real-estate companies have been selling assets at a slower pace this year, as the gap widens between their views on what their properties are worth and buyers' willingness to pay high prices.\par \par \uc2 After an eight-year bull run for commercial real estate, some investors have been anticipating a correction. But that hasn't happened yet, and there is little consensus on how much longer the bull market has to run.\par \par \uc2 Buyers, facing tighter lending conditions and slower income growth, are expecting lower prices and bidding accordingly, but sellers, including publicly traded property owners, are holding out for better deals.\par \par \uc2 Listed real-estate investment trusts have sold $46.7 billion in assets as of Oct. 23 this year, compared with $71 billion in assets sold in all of 2016, according to data from \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Acquisitions, on the other hand, have been at a roughly similar pace at around $44.6 billion as of Oct. 23 this year compared with $47.9 billion in 2016. There have been fewer major transactions especially in the office and retail real-estate sector.\par \par \uc2 Strong growth in property rents in recent years has fueled deal making, as owners met their targeted yields earlier than expected and buyers were bullish on further appreciation. This year, by contrast, rent growth apart from the industrial sector has been subdued or flat, said Brian McAuliffe, president of institutional properties at real-estate consultancy firm \uc2 CBRE Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Unlike previous cycles, property owners aren't overly leveraged and are still able to access the debt markets rather than be compelled to sell at unattractive prices.\par \par \uc2 "Sellers are comfortable with the performance of the rental markets if they hold their properties," said Mr. McAuliffe.\par \par \uc2 Mall REIT GGP Inc. in August said it would continue to lease its malls rather than sell them. That was a turnaround from May, when Chief Executive \uc2 Sandeep Mathrani\uc2  said it would explore "strategic alternatives," including a sale of the Chicago-based company following frustration over the public market's low valuation.\par \par \uc2 "We felt there was a lot of meat on the bone that the board didn't want to leave on the table," said Mr. Mathrani during the second-quarter earnings call in early August. Shares of GGP fell 4.9% that day and have yet to recover to levels in the May to July period.\par \par \uc2 A dearth in transactions of top-tier malls this year has made it difficult for analysts and investors to make more accurate calls about market conditions. "The extended period of inactivity is disquieting," said real-estate research firm \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2  in a recent note. "Mall REITs should be more active in selling assets given the massive current discounts at which they trade relative to our net asset value estimates."\par \par \uc2 Australian investment manager QIC's recent acquisition of \uc2 Forest City Realty Trust\uc2 's stake in 10 regional malls should have created some buzz since the assets sold at a capitalization rate, a measure of yield, of 5% to 6%. But the deal had been agreed upon some time ago and likely isn't indicative of the current transaction environment, Green Street said.\par \par \uc2 For REITs, there is the added burden of making sure any sales proceeds can be deployed for other uses quickly, given their inability to hoard cash. These landlords are hesitant to sell in part because of the lack of attractive assets to buy as well as a general reluctance to do share buybacks.\par \par \uc2 "The question is, where are they going to invest the capital?" said \uc2 Alexander Goldfarb\uc2 , managing director at \uc2 Sandler O'Neill + Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One exception would be New York City's largest office landlord, \uc2 SL Green Realty Corp\uc2 ., which has been active on the deals front this year. It sold 16 Court St. in Brooklyn in August and is currently in negotiations to sell its interest in the office building on 1515 Broadway. Alongside private investment manager RXR Realty, it also recently acquired a 49% stake in Worldwide Plaza, a Class A office building in Manhattan valued at $1.73 billion.\par \par \uc2 But SL Green also spent roughly $102 million in the third quarter to buy back shares under its share-repurchase plan, a larger-than-expected repurchase. The REIT has spent $350 million in share buybacks so far.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich522\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal7830

Now, venture capitalists say the next generation of investment will go toward \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  providers and similar services that use automation to detect the kind of malicious activity human operators can't stop.\par \par \uc2 Cybersecurity firms have taken on funding for a generation, since web users began to understand that every internet connection comes with some sort of risk attached. Initially, companies that promised a full cybersecurity platform--such as \uc2 Symantec Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 McAfee Inc\uc2 .--dominated the market by offering a suite of services centered around their antivirus software.\par \par \uc2 As digital threats have grown increasingly complicated, though, and the cost of security protecting data has climbed, a generation of startup companies has risen to prominence. Rather than focusing on antivirus software, the most successful startups have sought to differentiate themselves by specializing in clients' specific demands such as password authentication, endpoint anti-malware products, and other areas.\par \par \uc2 Cloud security startups received the most venture capital funding between 2012 and the second quarter of 2017, according to a WSJ Pro analysis of funding data, while investors say their focus is now shifting toward \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  firms.\par \par \uc2 Twenty of the top 100 offered some form of cloud security, the most of any category, while 18 companies advertised their product as "authentication," a category that ranges from identity management to log-in technology and password security. While A.I. companies don't hold a prominent place on the list, venture capitalists say that area will be an intense focus in the future.\par \par \uc2 A more complete breakdown of the 100 most funded organizations, based on data provided by Dow Jones' VentureSource research service, is available below. Note: various companies included in the top 100 were known for multiple offerings--cloud security and authentication, for instance--and were counted accordingly, creating a data set of 107 services.\par \par \uc2 Cloud Security: 20 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Companies that provide secure storage in the cloud.\par \par \uc2 Authentication: 18 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Identity management firms that promise to ensure that users are who they say.\par \par \uc2 Endpoint: 15 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Any service that promises to stop malicious software before it can infect clients' computers or corporate networks.\par \par \uc2 Network Security: 15 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Firms that specialize in firewalls, domain name servers and other infrastructure protection techniques.\par \par \uc2 Security Services: 12 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Any company that offers specialized services, such as changing clients' source code to stay ahead of attackers or deception techniques meant to uncover hackers.\par \par \uc2 Financial Technology: 8 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Enterprises that aim to eliminate digital fraud, so-called bot scamming, and the like.\par \par \uc2 Mobile Security: 6 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Companies that promise to protect smartphones and other portable connected devices.\par \par \uc2 Risk Assessment: 6 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Firms that offer independent security ratings and/or penetration testing, which occurs when third parties test an organization's vulnerabilities before hackers can.\par \par \uc2 Email Security: 4 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: A category primarily populated by anti-phishing and email management firms.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Artificial Intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 : 3 companies\par \par \uc2 Definition: Companies that rely on automation, algorithms and so-called \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to detect anomalies, analyze malicious code and stop malware before infections occur.\par \par \uc2 Up into the Cloud\par \par \uc2 Cloud security providers have taken on so much venture funding in part because of their willingness to store and secure clients' data at a fraction of the price it would cost a company to assume those responsibilities on its own, investors said.\par \par \uc2 "The move to cloud architecture is driving major spending in security," said Asheem Chandna, a partner at the venture firm \uc2 Greylock Partners\uc2 , estimating that between $50 billion and $70 billion is currently being spent on cloud storage, resulting in more spending on securing that data. "Over the next seven years I think there will be $500 billion on the cloud. That's a tremendous transfer in spending in the next few years."\par \par \uc2 Providers like \uc2 Zscaler Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Netskope Inc\uc2 . have risen to prominence as leaders in a crowded field of companies that aim to provide secure data storage.\par \par \uc2 The expected release of billions of internet-connected devices such as home appliances and innocuous office devices could be another boon to cloud security providers, as small startups seek a partner to store their data safely.\par \par \uc2 The Future of Security\par \par \uc2 The funding gold rush has led to an influx of security companies that often offer services with little to no difference from the competition. It's a situation that investors say they aim to resolve not by examining the A.I. and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms, but by assessing how that advanced technology is combined with other services and presented to the customer. For an A.I. product to be valuable in the eyes of an investor, it will need to be easy to use.\par \par \uc2 "You can't be a modern-day security company if you're not using A.I. and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  to solve problems," said \uc2 Ping Li\uc2 , a partner at the venture capital firm \uc2 Accel Partners\uc2 . "We look for how companies actually build an application around that."\par \par \uc2 Simply put, A.I. firms aim to build technology that automatically detects anomalies in large sets of data. Potential red flags might include a disgruntled employee trying to steal corporate intellectual property, nation state hackers seeking to access a company's health records, or a false positive which wrongly indicates something is wrong. Currently, sifting through millions of data points and false alarms presents a major problem for non-security companies unable to fill an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.csoonline.com/article/3200024/security/cybersecurity-labor-crunch-to-hit-35-million-unfilled-jobs-by-2021.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 estimated 3.5 million jobs}}}\uc2  expected to remain open through 2021.\par \par \uc2 Cylance Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Darktrace Ltd\uc2 ., which specialize in A.I. have earned reported valuations of over $1 billion and $825 million, respectively, though investors estimated that dozens of smaller A.I. firms have taken on private funding in recent months not covered by VentureSource data.\par \par \uc2 "There's as much marketing as anything else going into these but we're seeing that levels of automation are really essential to an effective cybersecurity posture," said Robert Ackerman, founder and managing director of the cybersecurity venture firm Allegis Capital, citing the 2014 breach at \uc2 Target Corp\uc2 . in which a true anomaly was buried by false positives.\par \par \uc2 "When Target identified that something was wrong, they were overwhelmed with information. When something like that goes wrong, the malware is the smallest needle in the biggest haystack of data imaginable. The underlying thing we need is for automation to identify those problems."\par \par \uc2 Market Contraction\par \par \uc2 Investors predicted a kind of survival-of-the-fittest scenario in which leaders emerge from crowded cybersecurity fields. Over the next 18 to 24 months, experts said, public companies will merge with other public companies while also acquiring smaller firms. Venky Ganesan, managing director at Menlo Ventures, predicted a rash of bankruptcies among the "many firms that are actually just ideas that are masquerading as companies."\par \par \uc2 The consolidation process has already begun. In August, the risk management firm Redowl \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  was acquired by the network security company \uc2 Forcepoint\uc2 , which itself is owned by the defense contractor Raytheon Co. Before that, the software giant \uc2 CA Technologies\uc2  acquired the application security firm \uc2 Veracode\uc2 , and a range of similar transactions have occurred in recent months.\par \par \uc2 Those kinds of deals, which are expected to continue, help clarify for investors a company's true value. When \uc2 CA Technologies\uc2  acquired \uc2 Veracode\uc2  for $614 million, for instance, that figure offered insight into the potential value of other app security companies.\par \par \uc2 "Cyber has been such a rich area of investment because the smaller companies have the ability to disrupt the larger players, and customers are willing to bet on the smaller companies because the nature of the threat is so acute," said \uc2 Ted Schlein\uc2 , general partner at venture-capital firm \uc2 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\uc2 , a major technology investor.\par \par \uc2 One reason smaller security startups are so well funded is because customers are willing to trust new firms that demonstrate they have new capabilities.\par \par \uc2 The risk of experiencing a breach is just too much, Mr. Schlein said.\par \par \uc2 "The world of cybersecurity is hardcore," he said. "Chief executives lose their job, companies can lose billions in market cap, and it's such a topical issue right now that it's all thrust into the media very quickly."\par \par \uc2 (Jeff Stone writes exclusively for WSJ Pro Cybersecurity.

Pot of gold Casa Verde Capital focuses exclusively on ancillary side of a fast-growing industry\par \par \uc2 When Karan Wadhera abandoned a successful career as an investment banker in Asia to plunge into North America's cannabis industry, former colleagues could have been forgiven for thinking he was smoking it himself.\par \par \uc2 But for Mr Wadhera, Indian by birth but who has a US education and entertainment-industry connections in Los Angeles, the move was an obvious one. "By 2013, it was clear that there was a business opportunity," he says. "It was a great moment to get proactive."\par \par \uc2 Today, Mr Wadhera is managing partner of Casa Verde Capital, a venture capital firm launched in 2015 that invests in technology companies serving the cannabis industry.\par \par \uc2 With an initial fund of $25m, Casa Verde, which counts the rapper Snoop Dogg among its four founding partners, is small compared with the likes of \uc2 Privateer Holdings\uc2  or Tuatara Capital, two of the US's biggest cannabis-focused investment companies.\par \par \uc2 But it has set itself apart by investing exclusively in the ancillary side of the market. With most of its investments made this year, Casa Verde has typically sunk $500,000 initially \u8212\'20\'14 often increasing it later \u8212\'20\'14 into each of seven start-ups in return for an equity stake ranging from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.\par \par \uc2 It has invested in Green Bits, which makes payments terminals that can handle the exacting compliance requirements for cannabis sales in retail dispensaries. Mr Wadhera says that their machines, in roughly 800 locations so far, are on course to process $1.7bn in payments this year alone.\par \par \uc2 It has also invested in LeafLink, a business-to-business platform that provides a market for dispensary owners to buy inventory from cannabis brands. In April 2016, when it started, the platform processed $12,000 in transactions; last month, it processed almost $14m.\par \par \uc2 Casa Verde plans to raise "a much larger fund" over the next year or two, Mr Wadhera says. The portfolio-building comes as US states are fast adopting more flexible laws on cannabis. At least 29 states have now legalised marijuana in some form. In January, California is set to legalise recreational marijuana, creating what is expected to be the world's single-largest legal cannabis market.\par \par \uc2 Roy Bingham, founder of the cannabis data company BDS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , estimates that the legal North American market last year was worth $6.7bn in sales \u8212\'20\'14 a figure he expects to grow to $22.6bn by 2021. He also says that the market is evolving beyond recognition.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people still tend to think about bags of weed," he says. "But half of the legal market is now branded consumer products sold in packaging similar to what you might buy at Walgreens."\par \par \uc2 Despite the market's rapid growth, Casa Verde's strategy of targeting ancillary companies speaks to two related structural issues that the industry faces.\par \par \uc2 The first is that cannabis remains illegal under federal law \u8212\'20\'14 a fact that poses potentially onerous risk even as the federal government has generally allowed businesses to operate as long as they comply with local laws.\par \par \uc2 "None of our investments touch the plant," explains Mr Wadhera. "There was some level of risk mitigation in that decision so we would probably not be under the same level of scrutiny [as hands-on cannabis companies]."\par \par \uc2 More important is the potential that ancillary businesses have for scaling up given that they are not bound by locally issued operating licences and regulations, which place strict limits on how and where producers and retailers can operate.\par \par \uc2 "We only wanted to be in businesses that could touch the entire industry," says Mr Wadhera. "If you have a friend with a licence for Santa Monica, you are very limited. You just can't scale in the way you might want to."\par \par \uc2 'None of our investments touch the plant. There was some level of risk mitigation in that decision'\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020180220edao001bf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Once approved by the panel, their nominations move to the full Senate.\par \par \uc2 SEC nominees are traditionally presented to Congress as a Republican-Democratic pair to preserve a partisan balance on the commission. Ms. Peirce has been tapped for a GOP slot on the commission before, during the Obama administration, but her nomination was one of many that stalled as Congress focused on other priorities. She is a researcher at the right-leaning Mercatus Center at \uc2 George Mason University\uc2  , and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-nominee-hester-peirce-is-outspoken-critic-of-post-crisis-regulation-1457978884"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 has criticized postcrisis overhauls }}}\uc2  such as the creation of the \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee this time around, Robert Jackson, is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/rob-jackson-joining-nyu-law-faculty-corporations-securities-sec"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a New York University law professor }}}\uc2  who has written on securities topics such as executive compensation and corporate governance.

A commission with all five seats filled should make it easier for Mr. Clayton to carry out his agenda of reducing the regulatory burden for public companies.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Clearinghouses Push Back Against Worries Over Their Size\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearinghouses-push-back-against-worries-over-their-size-1508839201"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Swaps clearinghouses are pushing back }}}\uc2  against the suggestion by a top Trump administration official that they have become too big and pose a market risk, saying regulatory and internal "stress tests" prove there is no cause for alarm.\par \par \uc2 National Economic Council Director \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2  said last week he worried the entities could be a "new systemic risk" to financial stability, a viewpoint supported by policy makers across the government. A day after Mr. Cohn's comments, a government regulator said its stress tests showed big U.S. clearinghouses could withstand a crisis-triggered liquidity crunch even if two of their major clearing member banks defaulted.\par \par \uc2 "I think Gary's comments were a bit ill-timed," Terry Duffy , chief executive of CME Group Inc., a major derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, said in an interview. "The clearinghouses, including CME, demonstrated that the two largest defaulters could go and they could still operate."\par \par \uc2 Trump Administration Increases Heat on CFPB's Arbitration Rule\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-increases-heat-on-cfpbs-arbitration-rule-1508775428"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Treasury Department on Monday criticized }}}\uc2  a rule governing how banks resolve disputes with consumers, part of an effort by the Trump administration to thwart a controversial plan initiated under the previous presidential administration.\par \par \uc2 The dispute relates to a July regulation issued by the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  , which continues to be run by an Obama-appointed official. The rule makes it easier for consumers to bring class-action lawsuits against financial companies by banning arbitration requirements written in the fine-print services contracts.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans are preparing to vote on a bill that would overturn the rule, which is unpopular in the financial industry. Senate GOP leadership has told Democrats to expect a vote this week.\par \par \uc2 SEC Approves Rule Requiring Auditors to Give Investors More Information\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-approves-accounting-rule-despite-business-groups-objection-1508799845"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Securities and Exchange Commission gave final approval }}}\uc2  Monday to a long-planned regulation that will require auditors to tell investors more about what they learn when they audit a company's books.\par \par \uc2 The SEC ratified a rule that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board passed in June that will require auditors to inform investors about "critical audit matters"\u8212\'20\'14any areas of a company's finances that the auditors found especially challenging or complex or which forced them to make tough judgment calls.\par \par \uc2 After the PCAOB approved the new rule, some companies and business groups had mounted a last-ditch effort to block the rule before the SEC, which oversees the PCAOB's work and must ratify its rules for them to take effect. They urged the SEC to reject the rule, contending it would create confusion and be too cumbersome and costly.\par \par \uc2 Trump Says \u8216\'20\'18No Change' to 401(k) Plans Under Forthcoming Tax Proposal\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-no-change-to-401-k-plans-under-forthcoming-tax-proposal-1508761011"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 President Donald Trump vowed on Monday }}}\uc2  to protect a popular retirement savings program, pledging to leave it untouched in the forthcoming Republican tax overhaul plan.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, in a tweet, shot down an idea that had been circulating in Washington policy circles and worrying the retirement-savings industry: limiting pretax contributions to retirement accounts.\par \par \uc2 "There will be NO change to your 401(k)," the president wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  .

On a consolidated basis, meaning that banks belonging to the same group count as one, there were 2,290 credit institutions at the end of last year versus 2,379 a year earlier and 2,904 in 2008. Bank executives have said that increased digitization leads to banks laying off workers. The ECB data showed that in 2016 alone nearly 7,000 bank branches were closed.\par \par \uc2 The ECB data also show, however, that the remaining banks are becoming healthier. Banks' median phased-in common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of bank health, stood at 15.4% last year, up from 14.4% one year earlier.\par \par \uc2 Warsh Met With Vice President Pence About Top Fed Job Last Week\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/warsh-met-with-vice-president-pence-about-top-fed-job-last-week-1508796045"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Kevin Warsh, a candidate for the Federal Reserve }}}\uc2  chairmanship, met with Vice President Mike Pence last week to talk about the central-bank job, according to a White House aide.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warsh visited Thursday\u8212\'20\'14the same day Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen was in the Oval Office interviewing for the same job with the president.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/10/23/sizing-up-the-fed-candidates-yellen-seen-as-best-for-u-s-stocks/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Sizing up the Fed Candidates: Yellen Seen as Best for U.S. Stocks }}}\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-talk-daily-analysis-roundup-1508795176"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Read our compilation of concise, timely analysis }}}\uc2  by Wall Street Journal reporters.

The theft of personally identifiable information is largely a U.S. problem because most other developed countries have far stricter laws about gathering personal data, says Nilson's publisher, David Robertson. However, "payment card data is always at risk anywhere in the world where it is stored by a merchant or processor," he says.

Rubin\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO\u8212\'20\'14Swaps clearinghouses are pushing back against the suggestion by a top Trump administration official that they have become too big and pose a market risk, saying regulatory and internal "stress tests" prove there is no cause for alarm.\par \par \uc2 National Economic Council Director \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2  said last week he worried the entities could be a "new systemic risk" to financial stability, a viewpoint supported by policy makers across the government.\par \par \uc2 A day after Mr. Cohn's comments, a government regulator said its stress tests showed big U.S. clearinghouses could withstand a crisis-triggered liquidity crunch even if two of their major clearing member banks defaulted.\par \par \uc2 "I think Gary's comments were a bit ill-timed," Terry Duffy , chief executive of CME Group Inc., a major derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, said in an interview. "The clearinghouses, including CME, demonstrated that the two largest defaulters could go and they could still operate."\par \par \uc2 Clearinghouses were beefed up after the 2008 financial crisis as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act routed more transactions through them in an effort to protect financial stability. A clearinghouse acts as middleman between the buyers and sellers of financial instruments such as commodities and derivatives, promising to complete the deal even if one side backs out.\par \par \uc2 "The clearing of swaps, as long as the market and the participants are managing that risk properly, is a much better system than it was before," Mr. Duffy said.\par \par \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange\uc2  CEO \uc2 Jeff Sprecher\uc2  , like Mr. Duffy, dismissed the worries about consolidation and said the regulators should avoid meddling with issues of market structure and competition. "Let the markets resolve competition issues," he told an industry conference in Chicago last week.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the clearinghouse stress tests released by the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  spurred policy makers to dial back their public concern on the risks posed by clearinghouses. In a speech on Thursday, Treasury Department regulatory czar Craig Phillips said his department's warnings about the systemic risk posed by clearinghouses "may have been misinterpreted."\par \par \uc2 Still, Trump-appointed policy makers and clearinghouses agree the clearing mandate for swaps trading, widely regarded as one of the most successful parts of Dodd-Frank, could be tweaked to counter some consolidation and liquidity concerns.\par \par \uc2 In particular, clearinghouses and their bank clearing members, as well as regulators at several agencies, say that a capital rule intended to provide a buffer against risky investments is actually preventing banks from doing more swap trading at clearinghouses, depressing liquidity.\par \par \uc2 The rule, known as the supplementary leverage ratio, is widely despised by banks because they believe it forces them to hold double the amount of capital they should have to hold for swap trading. That is because it counts collateral known as margin, which banks hold for customers on their cleared swaps transactions, as a risky asset rather than a risk-mitigating one.\par \par \uc2 The rule makes swap trading much less profitable than it might otherwise be, limiting the number of banks willing to invest heavily in swaps. That, many say, has led to a consolidation of clearing members at clearinghouses, and could cause liquidity issues in a crisis situation.\par \par \uc2 Regulators on both sides of the aisle have said the rule doesn't make sense for clearing member banks. Both \uc2 Timothy Massad\uc2  , the ex-Democratic chairman of the CFTC under former President Barack Obama, and his successor, Republican J. Christopher Giancarlo, have said the rule should be changed.\par \par \uc2 But to do so, the three major banking regulators\u8212\'20\'14the Fed, the \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2  ., and the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14would have to act together. While Fed and OCC officials have been sympathetic to a rule change, the FDIC under its current Obama-appointed leadership is more skeptical about changes to bank capital requirements.\par \par \uc2 In June testimony, FDIC Chairman \uc2 Martin Gruenberg\uc2  warned against changes to the leverage ratio, saying changes to the rule would "significantly weaken the resiliency of the U.S. banking system to future financial stress."\par \par \uc2 Those objections have riled other regulators, particularly at the CFTC, who don't have a direct say on changes to the rule.\par \par \uc2 "The fact that [the leverage ratio] so negatively impacts our regulatory space and we don't have jurisdiction over it is incredibly frustrating," Republican CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz told reporters at the industry conference in Chicago last week. "It requires new leadership [at the FDIC], whether that's a change in perspective of the existing leadership, or actual physical new people," he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gruenberg's term expires in November, but Mr. Trump has yet to nominate a permanent successor, making it unlikely the rule will change in the near future.\par \par \uc2 Other reasons for consolidation in clearing can't be readily resolved by regulatory changes. Swaps trading has become less profitable not just because of rule changes since the crisis, but because of low interest rates and low volatility in global markets.\par \par \uc2 "A flood of central bank liquidity has lowered interest rates globally and lowered volatility globally, so it's been very hard for traders and [clearing members] to make money, which leads to consolidation," said Mr. Sprecher, the \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange\uc2  CEO.\par \par \uc2 Trump Administration Increases Heat on CFPB's Arbitration Rule\par \par \uc2 By Yuka Hayashi\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The Treasury Department on Monday criticized a rule governing how banks resolve disputes with consumers, part of an effort by the Trump administration to thwart a controversial plan initiated under the previous presidential administration.\par \par \uc2 The dispute relates to a regulation issued in July by the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  , which continues to be run by an Obama-appointed official. The rule makes it easier for consumers to bring class-action lawsuits against financial companies by banning arbitration requirements written in the fine print of financial-services contracts.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans are preparing to vote on a bill that would overturn the rule, which is unpopular in the financial industry. Senate GOP leadership has told Democrats to expect a vote this week. Ahead of that possible vote, Trump officials who are against the rule have been vocal about their opposition.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  , an independent banking regulator affiliated with the Treasury Department and headed by an acting Trump official, earlier in October released an analysis saying that the rule would increase the cost of credit for consumers.\par \par \uc2 Acting Comptroller \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2  said the analysis showed there was an 88% chance that the rule would boost consumer credit costs for consumers, resulting in a 3.5-percentage-point increase in credit-card rates. Mr. Noreika also published an op-ed in the Hill accusing the CFPB of hiding data that he said would undermine the rule.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB disputed the OCC's analysis, saying it was "based on flawed statistics and is contradicted by publicly available historical data."\par \par \uc2 The Treasury report released Monday predicted that the new rule would generate more than 3,000 additional class-action lawsuits over the next five years, resulting in more than $500 million in additional legal-defense fees for the financial industry. The department also said the CFPB failed to consider less onerous alternatives to the ban on arbitration agreements.\par \par \uc2 "The bureau failed to meaningfully evaluate whether prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer financial contracts would serve either consumer protection or the public interest\u8212\'20\'14its two statutory mandates," the department said, adding that neither the CFPB's rule nor its data support those goals.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB said the Treasury report rehashes industry arguments that were analyzed and refuted in the final rule. "Our rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule found that mandatory arbitration clauses allow companies to avoid accountability for breaking the law and cost consumers billions of dollars by blocking group lawsuits," a CFPB spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 The spat underscores the different approaches to financial regulation taken by the Trump and Obama administrations. The CFPB, created after the financial crisis and still run by Obama appointee \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2  , has stuck with the agency's longstanding agenda into the Trump's presidency. The Treasury and the OCC, led by Trump appointees, have begun rolling back postcrisis banking regulations.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans hope to use the Congressional Review Act, a legislative tool that allows them to overturn a new regulation with a simple majority vote. They have spent weeks trying to persuade some skeptical members to support the vote.\par \par \uc2 The House voted in July to kill the rule. The Senate has until mid-November to take action. If it survives, the rule will become binding in March 2018.\par \par \uc2 Jaret Seiberg, an analyst for Cowen Washington Research Group, said the Treasury report is "a way to provide political cover" to Senate Republicans who are reluctant to support the bill to kill the rule. This, he wrote in a research note, lifts the chances Congress will overturn the role.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 SEC Approves Rule Requiring Auditors to Give Investors More Information\par \par \uc2 By Michael Rapoport\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  gave final approval Monday to a long-planned regulation that will require auditors to tell investors more about what they learn when they audit a company's books.\par \par \uc2 The SEC ratified a rule that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board passed in June that will require auditors to inform investors about "critical audit matters"\u8212\'20\'14any areas of a company's finances that the auditors found especially challenging or complex or which forced them to make tough judgment calls.\par \par \uc2 After the PCAOB approved the new rule, some companies and business groups had mounted a last-ditch effort to block the rule before the SEC, which oversees the PCAOB's work and must ratify its rules for them to take effect. They urged the SEC to reject the rule, contending it would create confusion and be too cumbersome and costly.\par \par \uc2 Trump Says \u8216\'20\'18No Change' to 401(k) Plans Under Forthcoming Tax Proposal\par \par \uc2 By Richard Rubin\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14President Donald Trump pledged Monday to protect a popular retirement-savings program, promising to leave it untouched in the forthcoming GOP plan to overhaul taxes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump, in a tweet, shot down an idea that had been circulating in Washington policy circles and worrying the retirement-savings industry: limiting pretax contributions to retirement accounts.\par \par \uc2 "There will be NO change to your 401(k)," the president wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  . "This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!"\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's comments point to a challenge he and fellow Republicans face as they race to write and pass a tax plan: They have ambitious targets for rate cuts and a self-imposed $1.5 trillion limit on the size of the tax cut over the decade.\par \par \uc2 Those guidelines have propelled them to look for large tax breaks they can limit or repeal and to seek budgetary maneuvers that shift the timing of tax revenue into the period measured by congressional scorekeepers.\par \par \uc2 The proposal to cap 401(k) contributions at as little as $2,400 a year and push additional savings into so-called Roth-style accounts where posttax dollars go in and money comes out tax-free in retirement was a combination of both. Much of the revenue it generated would have come from accelerating tax collections from the future into the near term.\par \par \uc2 But even a few days of chatter showed the concept's unpopularity, especially at the $2,400 level. By foreclosing changes to 401(k) plans, Mr. Trump again positioned himself in favor of a broadly enjoyed tax break.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump's decision to weigh in on a still-forming proposal showed how he can alter the legislative process, but it is Congress, not the president, that is putting the details together.\par \par \uc2 "Presidents have a right to make determinations and we ought to pay attention to it, but there are some things he shouldn't be shooting down," said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who said he didn't like the potential 401(k) limits. "He can make his moves, but we're going to do things up here that might be a little bit different and that might be one where we have to say we disagree, but we'll see."\par \par \uc2 Other parts of the tax plan that the president and congressional Republicans support would deliver significant benefits to households at the top of the income scale. Exact calculations of the plan's impact won't be possible until Republicans release a more specific proposal.\par \par \uc2 "I plan to hold President Trump to his word that he and congressional Republicans will not put forward any plan that taxes the retirement savings of American families," Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Monday. "We should be using tax reform as an opportunity to ensure that every American worker has the chance at a secure retirement, rather than using the retirement savings of middle-class families to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy."\par \par \uc2 Lobbyists and others in the retirement and financial-services industries who had spoken to congressional staff and committee members said last week that lawmakers are looking at proposals that would allow 401(k) participants to contribute significantly less before taxes than what is currently allowed in a traditional tax-deferred 401(k).\par \par \uc2 Those changes could have discouraged people from saving as much money, potentially limiting retirement savings and the fees that financial-services companies collect.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and author of the coming tax bill, said the president's tweet didn't change his panel's plans. He declined to elaborate on what retirement-policy changes were under consideration, if any.\par \par \uc2 "I don't want to get ahead of the committee," he said.\par \par \uc2 Once the House passes a budget, Mr. Brady is expected to announce the date when he plans to release the text of the tax bill and the date when the committee is scheduled to consider amendments and voting.\par \par \uc2 The Save Our Savings Coalition\u8212\'20\'14a group that includes AARP, \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2  . and \uc2 Northern Trust Corp\uc2  . \u8212\'20\'14said it was "thrilled" by the president's statement.\par \par \uc2 "We will continue to fight to ensure lawmakers do right by the middle class by preserving and expanding our retirement system as tax reform moves through Congress," the group said.\par \par \uc2 A version of the idea appeared in a draft tax plan Republicans released in 2014. Separately, former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, proposed barring people from making additional tax-advantaged contributions once their account balance hit $3.4 million. He also would have limited the tax benefits top earners could get from deferring taxes.

He was convicted on eight counts of wire fraud and one count of wire-fraud conspiracy; he was acquitted on a ninth wire-fraud count.\par \par \uc2 A lawyer for Mr. Johnson said his legal team planned to appeal the verdict, adding, "Today an innocent man was convicted."\par \par \uc2 "Mark Johnson exploited confidential information provided by a client of the bank to execute trades that were intended to generate millions of dollars in profits for him and the bank at the expense of their client," Bridget M. Rohde, the acting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement. She said the office would continue to prosecute those who "undermine public confidence in the operation of the financial markets by engaging in fraudulent schemes."\par \par \uc2 A sentencing date hasn't been set. The wire fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for HSBC didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Johnson left \uc2 HSBC\uc2  earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson, a British citizen, wasn't accused of rigging exchange rates, the main focus of the broader Justice Department probe.\par \par \uc2 Instead, he and a colleague, Stuart Scott -- \uc2 HSBC\uc2  's former European head of currency trading -- were charged in connection with a practice known as front-running, in which someone with advance knowledge of a major market order buys for their own account, then earns a profit when the larger transaction drives up the price.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Scott, who left \uc2 HSBC\uc2  in 2014, is in the U.K. fighting extradition and wasn't tried alongside Mr. Johnson. A lawyer for Mr. Scott couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, \uc2 HSBC\uc2  won the bidding to handle the conversion of $3.5 billion worth of dollars into British pounds on behalf of \uc2 Cairn Energy PLC\uc2  , an Edinburgh, Scotland-based oil-and-gas company, according to evidence presented at trial.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors alleged that the days and hours leading up to the transaction, \uc2 HSBC\uc2  traders in London and New York stockpiled millions of pounds in \uc2 HSBC\uc2  accounts, at Mr. Johnson's direction. At trial, jurors heard recordings of phone calls that prosecutors said showed Mr. Johnson using coded language to fellow currency traders to set off the buying spree.\par \par \uc2 When the transaction went through, on Dec. 7, 2011, Messrs. Johnson and Scott executed it in a way that drove up the price of the pound, prosecutors alleged, allowing them to sell \uc2 HSBC\uc2  's stockpiled currency at a higher price, while Cairn's proceeds from the exchange shrunk.\par \par \uc2 "This is not a coincidence -- this is a conspiracy," Brian Young, a trial attorney for the Justice Department, said in the prosecution's closing arguments.\par \par \uc2 The scheme netted $3 million in trading profits and $5 million in fees for \uc2 HSBC\uc2  , prosecutors said.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors used cooperating witnesses and the bank's recordings of Mr. Johnson's phone calls to argue he and others had conspired to use the client's confidential information to make money for \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and secure larger bonuses. "This is not how people talk when they are engaged in honest business transactions," Mr. Young said in closing arguments.\par \par \uc2 When Cairn noticed the rising price of the pound that day, another \uc2 HSBC\uc2  employee blamed it on purchases by a "Russian buyer," according to evidence presented at trial.\par \par \uc2 In one phone call recorded by \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and played at trial, Mr. Johnson said to Mr. Scott, "I think we got away with it." Mr. Johnson's lawyer said the statement reflected concern about the other employee's "misrepresentation" about the Russian transaction.\par \par \uc2 During the trial, lawyers for Mr. Johnson argued that he had been acting in the client's best interest, that prosecutors were trying to criminalize normal currency trading activity and had twisted their client's words to create the illusion of a conspiracy. In closing arguments, defense lawyer John Wing said prosecutors hadn't found "evidence of anything remotely close to criminal conduct."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson, who was arrested at John F. Kennedy airport in New York in July 2016, testified in his own defense at trial, at times seeking to explain comments he made in the recorded calls as jokes or misunderstandings.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in October, the \uc2 U.S. Federal Reserve\uc2  fined \uc2 HSBC\uc2  $175 million for failing to adequately supervise its foreign-exchange trading business, citing the alleged conduct by Messrs. Johnson and Scott as examples of the lack of oversight.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, the bank avoided criminal money-laundering charges by entering into a $1.9 billion settlement and a five-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. In 2014, the bank paid $614 million to settle allegations that it rigged benchmark currency rates.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Number of Eurozone Banks Continues to Fall\par \par \uc2 By Todd Buell\par \par \uc2 The total number of banks in the eurozone continued to decline last year, while lenders' capital buffers improved, data from the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  showed Monday.\par \par \uc2 On an unconsolidated basis, the number of credit institutions at the end of last year was 5,073 compared with 5,474 in the previous year.

In an interview with Fox News on Friday, he named Ms. Yellen, Fed governor Jerome Powell and John Taylor, a Stanford University economics professor, as favorites, without mentioning Mr. Warsh by name.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump has talked to all five about the job, interviewing Mr. Warsh last month.

Sixteen of them are still serving in the Senate. In 2014, two dozen Republicans voted against him when he was renominated, 22 of whom are still serving. Mr. Powell was confirmed both times.\par \par \uc2 One White House official Monday said the Republican opposition to Mr. Powell in those earlier votes suggested the party wouldn't be united behind a Powell nomination.\par \par \uc2 "Do you want to be nominating someone who got 24 \u8216\'20\'18No' votes for a lower position?" the official said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell likely could win enough support from Democrats to win approval this time, but his nomination could put some Republicans in a difficult position of switching their earlier votes.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.), a member of the Senate Banking Committee who voted against Mr. Powell's nomination in 2014, said Mr. Powell would "have to answer serious concerns both old and new" if his nomination came before the committee.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warsh, who served on the Fed board during the financial crisis, was a close adviser during that time to former Chairman Ben Bernanke.\par \par \uc2 Before joining the Fed, Mr. Warsh was an economic adviser to President George W.

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc90}{\*\bkmkend toc90}\b \uc2 Hartford to Buy Unit From \uc2 Aetna\b0\par\par\uc2 By Leslie Scism \par \uc2 571 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2017\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hartford Financial Services Group Inc\uc2  . has agreed to pay $1.45 billion to health insurer Aetna Inc. for a unit that provides life-, disability-income and other insurance products to employers' benefits programs in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The acquisition will nearly double the Connecticut company's business of selling benefits to employers, one of its main operations outside of property-casualty insurance.\par \par \uc2 Hartford Chairman and Chief Executive \uc2 Christopher Swift\uc2  said in an interview that the acquisition "will make us one of the top two players" in sales of the group-benefits products. Hartford's annual premium in the business will expand to about $5 billion from $3.15 billion in 2016, and there will be more than 20 million people insured by the combined operation.\par \par \uc2 Property-casualty insurance will remain Hartford's dominant business with more than $10.5 billion in annual premium.\par \par \uc2 The deal marks another sign of Hartford's turnaround from struggles during the 2008-09 global markets meltdown. It was among the hardest-hit insurers, when a long market-leading position in sales of a stock-market-linked retirement-income product proved riskier than anticipated. It took $3.4 billion in \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  aid, since repaid.\par \par \uc2 In a news release, Aetna President \uc2 Karen S. Lynch\uc2  said the divestiture allows "a stronger focus on our strategy of creating a personalized approach to improving member health." \uc2 Aetna\uc2  said options for deploying sales proceeds include internal investments, share repurchases and debt repayment.\par \par \uc2 Hartford doesn't intend to issue debt or equity to fund the purchase. It said it would use some money allocated for share buybacks and that the transaction would add to its 2018 earnings.\par \par \uc2 Hartford President \uc2 Doug Elliot\uc2  said the acquisition comes with important digital technology. Hartford will use \uc2 Aetna\uc2  's claims data in its advanced \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to try to find ways to speed up recoveries of people drawing on disability-income and workers' compensation policies.\par \par \uc2 The deal includes a multiyear arrangement in which \uc2 Aetna\uc2  's sales team will offer Hartford's group-insurance products to clients.\par \par \uc2 At Hartford during the financial crisis, then newly installed Chief Executive \uc2 Liam McGee\uc2  faced pressure from hedge-fund manager \uc2 John Paulson\uc2  to focus on its property-casualty business, possibly by spinning it off. Mr. McGee divested some operations to narrow Hartford's focus.\par \par \uc2 Hartford continues to wind down the precrisis book of variable annuities, which it quit selling after the crisis. In the interview, Mr. Swift said: "We've told our investors we're not the natural long-term owner [of the runoff unit], but we're happy running it off . . . It produces decent earnings." In 2014, Mr. Swift succeeded Mr. McGee, who died of cancer the following year.\par \par \uc2 Hartford has shown up on some Wall Street analysts' lists as both a buyer and seller in potential merger-and-acquisition activity. It is viewed as attractive as a target partly because it is a leading seller of property-casualty insurance to small and midsize companies. This is an area many large insurers consider ripe for increased use of algorithms in sizing up risk.\par \par \uc2 But at about $21 billion in market capitalization, Hartford is a size at which there is a limited number of potential acquirers.\par \par \uc2 "We are in attractive aspects of the market -- property-and-casualty and benefits -- with good execution, innovation . . . I feel like we can control our destiny," Mr. Swift said.\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020171024edao0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

He said at any time, Big Labs may have several experiments running. San Francisco-based Harness is the first of those experiments to launch as a company.\par \par \uc2 Harness is capitalizing on growth in dev ops, a process technology that companies like Netflix and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  use for quickly shipping new code and to update their apps multiple times a day.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bansal says he wants to allow every company, whether they're a bank or a retailer, to have access to such technology.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Facebook\uc2  , engineers were famously told "to move fast and break things." At one time, the mantra was plastered on the company's walls.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr. Bansal said not all companies can afford to move so briskly. Rash shipping of code can result in security gaps, or cause a platform to lag.\par \par \uc2 "I kept hearing, \u8216\'20\'18Can someone help us move fast and not break things?'" he said.\par \par \uc2 Harness is providing software intended to do just that. It uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to detect irregular activity as companies push out updates for their users more frequently.\par \par \uc2 The company has been working with customers like Build.com and \uc2 Jobvite\uc2  in beta.\par \par \uc2 Write to Cat Zakrzewski at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171024edao001up\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Big U.S. real-estate companies have been selling assets at a slower pace this year, as the gap widens between their views on what their properties are worth and buyers' willingness to pay high prices.\par \par \uc2 After an eight-year bull run for commercial real estate, some investors have been anticipating a correction. But that hasn't happened yet, and there is little consensus on how much longer the bull market has to run.\par \par \uc2 Buyers, facing tighter lending conditions and slower income growth, are expecting lower prices and bidding accordingly, but sellers, including publicly traded property owners, are holding out for better deals.\par \par \uc2 Listed real-estate investment trusts have sold $46.7 billion in assets as of Oct. 23 this year compared with $71 billion in assets sold in all of 2016, according to data from \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  . Acquisitions, on the other hand, have been at a roughly similar pace at around $44.6 billion as of Oct. 23 this year compared with $47.9 billion in 2016. There have been fewer major transactions especially in the office and retail real-estate sector.\par \par \uc2 Strong growth in property rents in recent years has fueled deal making, as owners met their targeted yields earlier than expected and buyers were bullish on further appreciation. This year, by contrast, rent growth apart from the industrial sector has been subdued or flat, said Brian McAuliffe, president of institutional properties at real-estate consultancy firm \uc2 CBRE Group\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Unlike previous cycles, property owners aren't overly leveraged and are still able to access the debt markets rather than be compelled to sell at unattractive prices.\par \par \uc2 "Sellers are comfortable with the performance of the rental markets if they hold their properties," said Mr. McAuliffe.\par \par \uc2 Mall REIT GGP Inc. in August said it would continue to lease its malls rather than sell them. That was a turnaround from May, when Chief Executive \uc2 Sandeep Mathrani\uc2  said it would explore "strategic alternatives," including a sale of the Chicago-based company following frustration over the public market's low valuation.\par \par \uc2 "We felt there was a lot of meat on the bone that the board didn't want to leave on the table," said Mr. Mathrani during the second-quarter earnings call in early August. Shares of GGP fell 4.9% on that day and have yet to recover to levels seen during the May to July period.\par \par \uc2 A dearth in transactions of top-tier malls this year has made it difficult for analysts and investors to make more accurate calls about market conditions.\par \par \uc2 "The extended period of inactivity is disquieting," said real-estate research firm \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2  in a recent note. "Mall REITs should be more active in selling assets given the massive current discounts at which they trade relative to our net asset value estimates."\par \par \uc2 Australian investment manager QIC's recent acquisition of \uc2 Forest City Realty Trust\uc2  's stake in 10 regional malls should have created some buzz since the assets sold at a capitalization rate, a measure of yield, of 5% to 6%. But the deal had been agreed upon some time ago and likely isn't indicative of the current transaction environment, Green Street said.\par \par \uc2 For REITs, there is the added burden of making sure any sales proceeds can be deployed for other uses quickly, given their inability to hoard cash. These landlords are hesitant to sell in part because of the lack of attractive assets to buy as well as a general reluctance to do share buybacks.\par \par \uc2 "The question is, where are they going to invest the capital?" said \uc2 Alexander Goldfarb\uc2  , managing director at \uc2 Sandler O'Neill + Partners\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 One exception would be New York City's largest office landlord, \uc2 SL Green Realty Corp\uc2  ., which has been active on the deals front this year. It sold 16 Court St. in Brooklyn in August and is currently in negotiations to sell its interest in the office building on 1515 Broadway. Alongside private investment manager RXR Realty, it also recently acquired a 49% stake in Worldwide Plaza, a Class A office building in Manhattan valued at $1.73 billion.\par \par \uc2 But SL Green also spent roughly $102 million during the third quarter to buy back shares under its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase plan, a larger-than-expected repurchase for the quarter. The REIT has spent $350 million in share buybacks so far.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts warn the decline in transactions might actually be masking weaknesses in prices of commercial real estate.\par \par \uc2 In New York City, \uc2 Morgan Stanley Research\uc2  found that while there is a deep pool of buyers for office buildings, there is a current valuation gap of around 10% or more between buyers and sellers, and the gap between winning bids and the next closest bidder is around 5% to 15%.\par \par \uc2 "In our view, this isn't particularly bullish even if it limits the extent of price declines," said the investment bank in a recent note.\par \par \uc2 Write to Esther Fung at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:esther.fung@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 esther.fung@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 More in Property Report\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-people-think-renting-is-a-better-deal-than-buying-1508842803"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 More People Think Renting Is a Better Deal Than Buying }}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-airbnb-a-boon-or-a-bane-for-tenants-boomers-and-millennials-disagree-1508842804"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Is Airbnb a Boon or a Bane for Tenants? }}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/backlog-in-eb-5-immigration-program-creates-cash-hoard-for-property-developers-1508842802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Backlog in Immigration Program Creates Cash Hoard for Property Developers }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171024edao002xl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

The capital injection will be used to invest in early-stage financial technology, cybersecurity and \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  startups. The fund is also starting to invest internationally.\par \par \uc2 The firm is funded by parent company, MassMutual, which provides some $560 billion in life insurance coverage and offers annuities and other financial products.\par \par \uc2 MassMutual Ventures\uc2  has already backed 20 startups {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020140724ea7osmgvd"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 since launch in 2014}}}\uc2 . Portfolio companies include Picwell and PolicyGenius, in the insurance technology category, as well as{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tuition-io-scores-7-million-for-student-loan-repayment-assistance-software-1505991602"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  student-loan provider Tuition.io}}}\uc2 , cybersecurity startup Pwnie Express, and data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company Tamr.\par \par \uc2 Startups recognize that the products offered by insurance companies are "too expensive, or too complicated, or not easily understood," said Doug Russell, managing director at MassMutual Ventures. Mr. Russell has worked in the insurance industry for more than 20 years.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, he said, today the burden of saving for retirement and choosing health insurance is increasingly on the shoulders of consumers. That is where technology can come in handy. "We can become more efficient at what we do," he said.\par \par \uc2 Startups are making a change not only by creating alternative products but also by focusing the attention of insurance companies on consumers, Mr. Russell said, which wasn't always the case.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, several large insurance companies have launched startup investing and partnership arms. AXA launched its AXA Strategic Ventures group with 200 million euros in 2015. \uc2 Liberty Mutual Insurance{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberty-mutual-launches-150m-vc-fund-invests-in-august-home-1463740516"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  committed $150 million}}}\uc2  to startup investing last year. Startups, for the most part, have welcomed the capital, connections, and hands-on help that insurance carriers offer.\par \par \uc2 The insurance industry had already had a love affair with startups back during the dot-com bubble, when entities such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB972491553425470053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Swiss Re and Credit Suisse Group had set up venture arms}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Recently, insurance startups have been {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurance-tech-startup-dollars-leap-1500895813"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 raising more capital}}}\uc2 , not just from strategic investors but from technology venture funds, as well.\par \par \uc2 MassMutual Ventures\uc2  is the type of corporate-funded investor that leads deals and takes board seats. But Mr. Russell said its primary interest is a financial return not a strategic connection to MassMutual. The investor won't stand in the way, he said, if a startup looks to make deals with MassMutual's competitors.\par \par \uc2 "None of our investment are made with any sort of conditions that MassMutual has a first right of anything," he said.\par \par \uc2 MassMutual Ventures\uc2  has made investments from $700,000 to $5 million and can invest up to $10 million per company.\par \par \uc2 The firm has made its first investment outside of the U.S. in recent weeks by backing a startup in Israel, according to Mr. Russell. The new $100 million allocation will allow it to invest in Canada, Europe and Israel, where the firm sees opportunities in \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and cybersecurity, Mr. Russell said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Yuliya Chernova at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:yuliya.chernova@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 yuliya.chernova@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171024edao00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

With the majority of its investments made this year, Casa Verde has typically sunk $500,000 initially \u8212\'20\'14 often ramping up later \u8212\'20\'14 into each of seven start-ups in return for an equity stake ranging from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.\par \par \uc2 It has invested in Green Bits, which makes payments terminals that can handle the exacting compliance requirements for cannabis sales in retail dispensaries. Mr Wadhera says that their machines, in roughly 800 locations so far, are on course to process $1.7bn in payments this year alone.\par \par \uc2 It has also invested in LeafLink, a business-to-business platform that provides a market for dispensary owners to buy inventory from cannabis brands. In April 2016, when it started, the platform processed $12,000 in transactions; in September this year, it processed almost $14m.\par \par \uc2 Casa Verde plans to raise \u8220\'20\'1Ca much larger fund\u8221\'20\'1D over the next year or two, Mr Wadhera says.\par \par \uc2 The portfolio-building comes as US states are fast adopting more flexible laws on cannabis. At least 29 states have now legalised marijuana in some form. In January, California is set to legalise recreational marijuana, creating what is expected to be the world\u8217\'20\'19s single-largest legal cannabis market.\par \par \uc2 Roy Bingham, founder of cannabis data firm BDS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , estimates that the legal North American market last year was worth $6.7bn in sales \u8212\'20\'14 a figure he expects to grow to $22.6bn by 2021. He also says that the market is evolving beyond recognition.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CA lot of people still tend to think about bags of weed,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CBut half of the legal market is now branded consumer products sold in packaging similar to what you might buy at Walgreens.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In spite of the market\u8217\'20\'19s rapid growth, Casa Verde\u8217\'20\'19s strategy of targeting ancillary companies speaks to two related structural issues hanging over the industry.\par \par \uc2 The first is that cannabis remains illegal under federal law \u8212\'20\'14 a fact that poses potentially onerous risk even as the federal government has generally allowed businesses to operate as long as they comply with local laws.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNone of our investments touch the plant,\u8221\'20\'1D explains Mr Wadhera. \u8220\'20\'1CThere was some level of risk mitigation in that decision so we would probably not be under the same level of scrutiny\u8221\'20\'1D as hands-on cannabis companies.\par \par \uc2 More important is the potential that ancillary businesses have for scaling up given that they are not bound by locally issued operating licences and regulations, which place strict limits on how and where producers and retailers can operate.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe only wanted to be in businesses that could touch the entire industry,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Wadhera. \u8220\'20\'1CIf you have a friend with a licence for Santa Monica, you are very limited. You just can\u8217\'20\'19t scale in the way you might want to.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180220edan009c6\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par
