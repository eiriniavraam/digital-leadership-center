Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Blockchain is reputed to be immune to hacking and fraud, but in the wake of a Chinese crackdown on bitcoin trading and initial coin offerings, it is also showing its resistance to regulatory attack.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The world of Chinese cryptocurrencies and blockchain tokens suffered a blow last month when authorities\u160\'00\'A0shut down\u160\'00\'A0local bitcoin exchanges and\u160\'00\'A0banned ICOs. But both markets have bounced back quickly, proving that the decentralised nature of the market makes it resilient even to the heavy hand of authoritarian government.\par \par \uc2 "China\u8217\'20\'19s government can\u8217\'20\'19t stop \uc2 ICO\uc2  investing from an individual perspective as long as the individuals are savvy enough to use virtual private networks (a low bar) and know what projects they want to invest in,\u8221\'20\'1D says\u160\'00\'A0John Riggins, Shanghai-based head of Asia operations for BTC Media, a fintech information platform.\par \par \uc2 About\u160\'00\'A065 ICOs raised an estimated Rmb2.6bn ($392m) in the first seven months of 2017, according to the Beijing Internet Finance Association. But the \uc2 People\u8217\'20\'19s Bank of China\uc2  said that 90 per cent of these deals were fraudulent, prompting the shutdown.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, after initially allowing Chinese bitcoin exchanges to continue operating so long as they tightened up know-your-client and anti-money-laundering protections, authorities finally brought the axe down, forcing the exchanges to shut down entirely.\par \par \uc2 Market observers said the huge run-up in the price of bitcoin and rival cryptocurrency ethereum made regulators nervous about the consequences if their prices were to suffer a sudden correction.\par \par \uc2 In the run-up to the five-yearly leadership transition that will conclude in Beijing this week, the concern for stability was even higher than normal. President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0called on\u160\'00\'A0the Communist party to make\u160\'00\'A0\u8220\'20\'1Cfinancial security\u8221\'20\'1D a top priority this year.\par \par \uc2 But over-the-counter bitcoin and ethereum trading continues. While Tencent\u8217\'20\'19s ubiquitous \uc2 WeChat\uc2  mobile messaging app is sometimes used to coordinate trades, concern about surveillance has pushed communication onto encrypted platforms like\u160\'00\'A0Telegram.\par \par \uc2 Mr Riggins said that a Chinese investor would have little trouble selling 100 bitcoins \u8212\'20\'14 worth about $600,000 at the current price \u8212\'20\'14 through OTC trades.\par \par \uc2 As for ICOs, they are even harder to stop. Because investors subscribe to ICOs using bitcoin or ethereum, capital controls cannot prevent Chinese investors who already own cryptocurrencies from subscribing. Investors in a\u160\'00\'A0Chinese ICO need only create an account on an \uc2 ICO\uc2  platform in Hong Kong or Singapore.\par \par \uc2 Aur\u233\'00\'E9lien Menant, chief executive of Gatecoin, a blockchain token exchange in Hong Kong,\u160\'00\'A0told the South China Morning Post\u160\'00\'A0that he has received a large number of inquiries from mainland blockchain projects that want to list their tokens on Gatecoin, as well as a surge in registrations from Chinese users.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, while the shutdown of Chinese bitcoin exchanges may have eliminated some bitcoin demand by making it more difficult to buy bitcoin using renminbi, the parallel shutdown of mainland ICOs has pushed the market\u160\'00\'A0in the opposite direction. That is\u160\'00\'A0because Chinese ICO sponsors need to buy bitcoin to comply with the government\u8217\'20\'19s regulation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll \uc2 ICO\uc2  teams in China should return funds as bitcoin or ethereum to their investors.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hartford Financial Services Group Inc\uc2 . has agreed to pay $1.45 billion to health insurer Aetna Inc. for a unit that provides life-, disability-income and other insurance products to employers' benefits programs in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The acquisition will nearly double the Connecticut company's business of selling benefits to employers, one of its main operations outside of property-casualty insurance.\par \par \uc2 Hartford Chairman and Chief Executive \uc2 Christopher Swift\uc2  said in an interview that the acquisition "will make us one of the top-two players" in sales of the group-benefits products. Hartford's annual premium in the business will expand to about $5 billion from $3.15 billion in 2016, and there will be more than 20 million people insured by the combined operation.\par \par \uc2 Property-casualty insurance will remain Hartford's dominant business with more than $10.5 billion in annual premium. Hartford also has a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hartford-funds-to-buy-lattice-strategies-and-its-etfs-1463602968"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mutual-funds operation}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Hartford's rivals in group insurance include \uc2 Lincoln National Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 MetLife Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Prudential Financial Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Unum Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The deal marks another sign of Hartford's turnaround from struggles during the 2008-09 global markets meltdown. It was among the hardest-hit insurers, when a long market-leading position in sales of a stock-market-linked retirement-income product proved riskier than anticipated. It took {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304520804576341113561821194"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $3.4 billion in U.S. government aid}}}\uc2 , since repaid.\par \par \uc2 In a news release, Aetna President \uc2 Karen S. Lynch\uc2  said the divestiture allows "a stronger focus on our strategy of creating a personalized approach to improving member health." \uc2 Aetna\uc2  said options for deploying sales proceeds include internal investments, share repurchases and debt repayment.\par \par \uc2 Hartford doesn't intend to issue debt or equity to fund the purchase. It said it would use some money allocated for share buybacks and said the transaction would add to its 2018 earnings.\par \par \uc2 Hartford President \uc2 Doug Elliot\uc2  said the acquisition comes with important digital technology. Hartford will use \uc2 Aetna\uc2 's claims data in its advanced \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to try to find ways to speed up recoveries of people drawing on disability-income and workers' compensation policies. Workers' compensation is one of Hartford's major property-casualty product lines.\par \par \uc2 The deal includes a multiyear arrangement in which \uc2 Aetna\uc2 's sales team will offer Hartford's group-insurance products to clients.\par \par \uc2 At Hartford during the financial crisis, then-newly installed Chief Executive \uc2 Liam McGee\uc2  faced pressure from hedge-fund manager \uc2 John Paulson\uc2  to focus on its property-casualty business, possibly by spinning it off. Mr. McGee divested some operations to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304636404577294972124322432"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 narrow Hartford's focus}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Hartford continues to wind down the precrisis book of variable annuities, which it quit selling after the crisis. In the interview, Mr. Swift said: "We've told our investors we're not the natural long-term owner [of the runoff unit], but we're happy running it off\u8230\'20\'26 It produces decent earnings." In 2014, Mr. Swift succeeded Mr. McGee, who died of cancer the following year.\par \par \uc2 Hartford has shown up on some Wall Street analysts' lists as both a buyer and seller in potential merger-and-acquisition activity. It is viewed as attractive as a target partly because it is a leading seller of property-casualty insurance to small and midsize companies, and this is an area many large insurers consider ripe for increased use of algorithms in sizing up risk.\par \par \uc2 But at about $21 billion in market capitalization, Hartford is a size where there are a limited number of potential acquirers.\par \par \uc2 "We are in attractive aspects of the market--property-and-casualty and benefits\u8212\'20\'14with good execution, innovation. ...I feel like we can control our destiny," Mr. Swift said.\par \par \uc2 Many insurance deals over the past couple of years have had Chinese, Japanese and Canadian investment firms and insurers as buyers. In contrast, the 207-year-old Hartford is a longtime neighbor in Connecticut's capital to \uc2 Aetna\uc2 , which was founded in 1853.\par \par \uc2 Write to Leslie Scism at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:leslie.scism@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 leslie.scism@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171023edan001e1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Beijing has made it a priority to support strategic technology sectors such as AI and robotics.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CChina needs to go to higher value-added manufacturing, and this is the government\u8217\'20\'19s way of getting there,\u8221\'20\'1D said Jonas Short, Beijing head of \uc2 Sun Hung Kai Financial\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As a result, local governments and state-owned companies have set up funds for investment in local tech companies. All cities have funds to distribute, ranging from $10m to $50m, according to \uc2 KPMG\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Those \u8220\'20\'1Cgovernment guidance funds\u8221\'20\'1D are set to eclipse private VC funds in China in size, according to data compiled by SHKF. As of September 2016, government guidance funds had a total fundraising target of Rmb3.3tn ($500bn), compared with Rmb2.2tn raised in 2016 by private funds.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe aim is to provide support for strategic industries rather than control the firms,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Short added.\par \par \uc2 One of the largest guidance funds is owned by the provincial government of Hubei, which made a Rmb40bn injection into the Hubei Yangtze River Belt Industrial Fund \u8212\'20\'14 a fund of funds including other private investors that aims to reach Rmb200bn in size.\par \par \uc2 As of the end of May, the Jiangsu Provincial Government Investment Fund had raised Rmb80bn, of which Rmb10.3bn was given by the government.\par \par \uc2 Chinese government support \u8220\'20\'1Chas significantly sped up the development of early-stage tech start-ups in China\u8221\'20\'1D, said Philip Ng, partner at \uc2 KPMG\uc2  China. \u8220\'20\'1CGovernment-backed incentives, including tax incentives, grants, low- or no-interest loans and rental subsidies are offered to early-stage companies,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Ng added.\par \par \uc2 The results can already be seen: the country is experiencing a boom in private fundraising by \u8220\'20\'1Cunicorns\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 tech companies valued at more than $1bn.\par \par \uc2 China attracted $10.2bn of investment in the third quarter, according to \uc2 KPMG\uc2 , compared to a global total of $39.4bn. The mainland accounted for half of the top 10 global VC financings in the quarter, including the $2bn raised by Chinese news aggregator Toutiao.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171022edam000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

But not so much that he is not ready to put another $600m of venture money to work \u8212\'20\'14 not to mention the $15bn his group already ploughed in last year. As the man in charge of venture investing for Abu Dhabi's Mubadala sovereign wealth fund, Mr Ajami's general wariness is appropriate. Funds like his have come late to the party, at what, for a while, has been looking like a cyclical peak in start-up funding. His defence is that good companies never have a problem going public, and that there are enough truly disruptive, world-beating companies to make it worthwhile.\par \par \uc2 It is true that buying into tech start-ups at what look like historically excessive valuations, does not necessarily end in tears. You just have to make sure it is the right start-ups you are over-paying for.\par \par \uc2 Sovereign wealth funds have been a feature on the start-up landscape for the past two or three years, ever since late-stage venture rounds started to top $1bn. They are now going one step further, setting up dedicated funds and local offices of their own in San Francisco.\par \par \uc2 Mr Ajami's Mubadala this week said its own local office would run a $400m venture fund \u8212\'20\'14 half of the money being provided by Japan's SoftBank \u8212\'20\'14 and a $200m "fund of funds", placing money with other local VCs. Malaysia's Khazana has been on the ground since 2013, though, according to Crunchbase, has only led an investment round in one local company, \uc2 Fractal \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The desire to get a seat at the local table is understandable. For the wave of sovereign cash hitting tech, the challenge has been one of access. Putting very large amounts to work risks distorting the normal patterns of venture investing, and is particularly problematic for a group of investors without either close ties to the Silicon Valley network or much to offer other than cold, hard cash. That can lead to high-risk bets. When the \uc2 Kuwait Investment Authority\uc2  led a $165m round in then-struggling wearable tech company Jawbone early last year, it at least went in at half the valuation of earlier investors. But little more than a year later, Jawbone was on the rocks.\par \par \uc2 SWFs are setting up dedicated The $502m investment this week in augmented reality start-up Magic Leap, led by the Singaporean state investment fund \uc2 Temasek\uc2 , takes the amount raised by that company to nearly $2bn, even though it has yet to release a product.\par \par \uc2 funds and offices of their own in San Francisco Local venture capitalists naturally worry that the sheer scale of the sovereign wealth money is inevitably driving up valuations of latestage businesses. They also fear that it is leading companies to stay private for longer, further delaying the moment when traditional early-stage investors see a return.\par \par \uc2 Saudi Arabia's $3.5bn bet on Uber last year marked the peak valuation for the ride-hailing company, at least for now. Its investment lifted the previous valuation by nearly a quarter, to $68.5bn on a post-money basis.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank's Vision Fund (largely backed by Saudi money, with $15bn from Mubadala) is now negotiating to buy a large secondary stake in Uber at a valuation said to be around $50bn. Not the least of the considerations is how to structure the deal in a way that saves the Saudi blushes and avoids too many allusions to "dumb money".\par \par \uc2 Mubadala's $400m investment vehicle, by contrast, looks more like a traditional early- and mid-stage venture fund. The money is earmarked for about 25 investments, and the fund has already made two in life science companies.\par \par \uc2 Getting into the right deals will be key. The returns in the venture capital industry have always gone disproportionately to a small handful of funds, with the top decile taking just about all of the industry's profits.\par \par \uc2 That makes it essential to build relationships. Through investments in other VC funds, Mubadala already claims connections with VC firms like Data Collective, Arch Ventures and Sherpa Capital. Getting a foot in the door with the venture world's A-list is the next essential step. Hence the $200m "fund of funds": Mr Ajami lists firms such as Sequoia Capital and \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  as the sort he hopes to build a relationship with by investing that money.\par \par \uc2 With its Vision Fund, SoftBank offered investors like Mubadala a quick way to put a lot of money to work, with both limited risk and limited return. Of the Abu Dhabi money in the fund, $9bn is in the form of preferred stock that pays a guaranteed dividend, with only $6bn in pure equity. Now, by trying to put down local roots, Mubadala is signalling that it wants to be all-in.\par \par \uc2 richard.waters@ft.com\par \par \uc2 SWFs are setting up dedicated funds and offices of their own in San Francisco\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171020edak0007g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

His successor will inherit a company facing the political challenges of the UK's departure from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  hanging over it while markets rapidly evolve to encompass new technologies such as blockchain.\par \par \uc2 "He's had a great run but it's going to get a lot more difficult for the \uc2 LSE\uc2 ," says Niki Beattie, head of Market Structure Partners, a capital markets consultancy. "The \uc2 LSE\uc2  board will have to play a crucial role in thinking about the challenges the exchange will face."\par \par \uc2 When the 57-year old announced his retirement from the 319-year-old institution for a second time, he stressed there would be no immediate change to the \uc2 LSE\uc2 's strategy. "The fact that I'm going to be here for some time means it will be business as usual," Mr Rolet told analysts on a conference call yesterday.\par \par \uc2 When the merger with \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  was agreed, Mr Rolet was due to retire and strategy was based on the UK being in the \uc2 EU\uc2 . The deal fell apart and the next incumbent will need to reshape the company from the model that Mr Rolet created nearly a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 Less than a year before Mr Rolet's arrival, the \uc2 LSE\uc2 , home to some of Europe's biggest banks, suffered an IT glitch for seven hours days before \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  collapsed.\par \par \uc2 Investors \u8212\'20\'14 who had watched the \uc2 LSE\uc2  lose market share to new cheaper competition and turn down takeover attempts from bigger rivals \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  and \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 were aghast.\par \par \uc2 Now, its $17bn market capitalisation makes it the world's fourth-largest exchange, and bigger than \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I would expect the vacancy to attract a high-profile candidate with M&A experience and for the board to look internationally. Today's figures highlight that the business is in great shape," says Trevor Green, head of UK equities at \uc2 Aviva Investors\uc2 , a long-term \uc2 LSE\uc2  shareholder.\par \par \uc2 The first of the many deals completed in Mr Rolet's tenure was the $30m purchase of MillienniumIT to fix the \uc2 LSE\uc2 's defective technology. But the \uc2 LSE\uc2  was a mid-sized company that had missed out on several prized industry assets, notably the Liffe derivatives exchange. Instead Mr Rolet, a former \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and Lehman banker, spent his time building closer relationships with big banks and more than \u163\'00\'A34bn on data and clearing businesses as markets evolved after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Deals for index compilers \uc2 Russell Investments\uc2  and the 50 per cent it did not own in \uc2 FTSE International\uc2  were in response to changing trends in fund management; the purchase of a controlling stake in LCH, the clearing house, was to exploit new rules demanding that more over-the-counter derivatives deals negotiated by banks were processed through the independent risk managers.\par \par \uc2 He has also focused on developing small and medium businesses from around the world, either to list or develop in a mentoring programme.\par \par \uc2 As a consequence the \uc2 LSE\uc2 's operating profits have risen from \u163\'00\'A3182m on revenues of \u163\'00\'A3605m in 2010 to \u163\'00\'A3426.8m on revenues of \u163\'00\'A31.5bn. "At times we took risks, we made a few moves, sometimes they could be qualified as bold moves," Mr Rolet told analysts yesterday.\par \par \uc2 Mr Rolet has at least paved the way for the board to attract candidates from across financial markets. In her final year his predecessor \uc2 Clara Furse\uc2  was paid a base salary of \u163\'00\'A3540,000 with a bonus of \u163\'00\'A3648,000. Mr Rolet's base salary is \u163\'00\'A3800,000 and his total remuneration last year was \u163\'00\'A35.7m, down from \u163\'00\'A36.5m a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Below the revenue and profit growth, his successor inherits problems.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lack of technical integration across a number of the assets. The organisation is quite siloed, and that may impact performance without a strong and respected leader," says Jake Pugh, an industry consultant.\par \par \uc2 Indicating the cost pressure in the fund management industry, this week \uc2 State Street\uc2  abandoned three FTSE exchange-trade funds benchmarks in favour of an in-house alternative.\par \par \uc2 A future chief will have to deal with the UK's departure from the \uc2 EU\uc2  and incoming markets rules, known as Mifid II. The legislation will mandate greater transparency and competition in fixed income and derivatives markets, areas at which Mr Rolet has directed much of the \uc2 LSE\uc2 's attention in recent years.\par \par \uc2 But the biggest issue will be the one that has dogged the \uc2 LSE\uc2  since the turn of the century, the one that Mr Rolet tried to resolve with the \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  deal; its independence. For now, uncertainty over the UK's future has deterred bidders. A successor may have to come up with another answer.\par \par \uc2 See Lex Search effort Up to a year to find the right candidate \uc2 Xavier Rolet\uc2  could take up to a year, the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  admitted, as it said the chief executive would leave by the end of December 2018.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 LSE\uc2  said it would work closely with Mr Rolet and would look internally and externally to find the right candidate.\par \par \uc2 Few names emerged yesterday, although analysts and executives expect there to be lots of interest.\par \par \uc2 With Mr Rolet's appointment in 2009, the \uc2 LSE\uc2  was among the first exchanges to recruit a former investment banker as its chief executive \u8212\'20\'14 a now-common industry trend.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 TOKYO\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 ., which runs what is already the world's biggest technology investment fund, is planning to create a second fund that could be even larger, according to people close to the Japanese telecommunications and investment giant.\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 , whose $100 billion Vision Fund hasn't finished raising money, is floating tentative plans for a second Vision Fund that could be about $200 billion in size, said one person familiar with the company's plans.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with Japan's Nikkei business daily published Friday, SoftBank chief executive \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2  said he hopes to launch a new fund every two or three years, amassing a huge pool of capital to invest in technology companies around the world. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-carries-bulk-of-the-risk-in-worlds-biggest-tech-fund-1495828542"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 first Vision Fund}}}\uc2 , backed by contributions from sovereign-wealth funds and tech giants such as \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 ., was started earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 "The Vision Fund was just the first step. Ten trillion yen ($88 billion) is simply not enough," Mr. Son told the Nikkei, saying that the Vision Fund will have invested its entire $100 billion investment pool in about two years. "I want to create a mechanism by which we can build our funding capability by \u165\'00\'A510 trillion, \u165\'00\'A520 trillion, \u165\'00\'A5100 trillion."\par \par \uc2 Through the funds, SoftBank hopes to invest in about 1,000 companies in 10 years, he said. A SoftBank spokesman confirmed Mr. Son made those statements.\par \par \uc2 Several people close to the company said the plans are at an early stage and that SoftBank hasn't started marketing a second fund. \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  said in May it plans to complete capital raising for the first Vision Fund by the end of November.\par \par \uc2 The gigantic numbers Mr. Son has thrown about show how his ambitions are shaking up the tech-investment world. Backed by a $45 billion pledge from Saudi Arabia's state-owned \uc2 Public Investment Fund\uc2 , the first Vision Fund already dwarfs other rival tech investors. The $100 billion targeted for the first Vision Fund\u8212\'20\'14of which {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/web-retailer-fanatics-raises-1-billion-from-softbanks-vision-fund-1502219551"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $93 billion has so far been raised}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14is roughly equal to the total amount invested in venture businesses globally last year, according to research firm CB Insights.\par \par \uc2 Rival tech investors say the fund's sheer size has the potential to inflate company valuations, while some entrepreneurs worry that spurning investments from the Vision Fund could send capital to rival businesses. The availability of private money from the fund is also enabling late-stage technology companies to put off going public for longer periods, say analysts and investors.\par \par \uc2 "It will take opportunities away from public markets," \uc2 Sam Altman\uc2 , president of the tech incubator \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , said at a panel at The Wall Street Journal's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-are-cautious-on-techs-big-startups-many-may-be-overvalued-1508360252"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 D.Live technology conference}}}\uc2  earlier this week. "That's really bad."\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  declined to say where the money for additional Vision Funds would come from. One idea is that SoftBank could open a portion of one fund to retail investors, according to a person familiar with the company.\par \par \uc2 There is also the question of what companies additional Vision Funds could invest in. The first fund has largely targeted companies with valuations of at least $1 billion. It has so far committed more than $25 billion in investments, according to calculations by the Journal, and is trying to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-shareholders-divided-over-softbanks-investment-offer-1505409810"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pump as much as $10 billion}}}\uc2  into ride-hailing firm \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 ., according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 There are 217 private companies globally valued at $1 billion or more, worth roughly $750 billion in total, according to CB Insights. Many of these so-called unicorns have raised money at lofty valuations but have yet to deliver promised growth.\par \par \uc2 The Vision Fund is the brainchild of Mr. Son, 60 years old, a Korean-Japanese entrepreneur known for his brash investment style and long-term views on technological trends. He was behind SoftBank's early investments in companies such as \uc2 Yahoo Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\uc2 . that were highly profitable.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son has said his goal is to create a loose global network of companies that will solve future technological problems together, and capitalize on bewilderingly fast-moving changes in areas like \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , robotics and biotech.\par \par \uc2 Phred Dvorak and Eliot Brown\par \par \uc2 Write to Mayumi Negishi at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:mayumi.negishi@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mayumi.negishi@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171020edak001xh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

But despite a political furor over the breach, demonstrated by no fewer than five congressional hearings into either Equifax or the companies' business model, it remains unclear if Congress\u8212\'20\'14consumed with other priorities\u8212\'20\'14will pass a bill to turn the screws on the firms.\par \par \uc2 In the House, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.) {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/key-house-republican-plans-bill-to-rein-in-credit-bureaus-after-equifax-hack-1507802400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 introduced sweeping legislation last week}}}\uc2  to require the three major credit-reporting firms\u8212\'20\'14Equifax, \uc2 Experian PLC\uc2  and TransUnion\u8212\'20\'14to submit to federal cybersecurity reviews for the first time, provide free credit freezes for certain groups of consumers and phase out their use of Social Security numbers to verify consumers' identities. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2yBwLws"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The bill}}}\uc2  is largely a starting point for the Financial Services Committee to build on, according to congressional aides.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile in the Senate, David Perdue (R., Ga.) on Wednesday {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2yAPurx"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 introduced nearly identical legislation}}}\uc2  to Mr. McHenry's. The Senate bill excludes cybersecurity reviews in deference to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), who is reviewing gaps in the regulatory structure. The Georgia lawmaker, according to people familiar with his thinking, didn't want to lay down a marker on the issue until Mr. Crapo's work is further along.\par \par \uc2 In hearings, Mr. Crapo has said he found the hack shocking and urged a "meaningful discussion" about how to protect and limit access to consumers' personal information. He is also pressing banking regulators on whether they need more authority to supervise the credit-reporting firms to ensure they adequately protect consumer data. "I am concerned there may be a regulatory gap with respect to supervision of credit reporting agencies for data security standards," he wrote in a letter to the heads of the Federal Reserve, \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  and \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . last week. Mr. Crapo asked the policy makers to respond by today.\par \par \uc2 Though neither existing bill has any co-sponsors, analysts say Mr. McHenry's bill could eventually clear the House\u8212\'20\'14a chamber where the North Carolina lawmaker serves as the chief deputy whip and holds significant sway among fellow Republicans. But its fate is far murkier in the Senate, where Democrats hold more clout than in the House and might push for a more aggressive response that upends the companies' business models.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on Mr. Crapo's panel, has noted that consumers have more control over their personal medical data, and questioned why similar standards shouldn't be applied to financial information.\par \par \uc2 Such comments raise questions about how the industry can be overhauled, and whether doing so would make it harder or more cumbersome for consumers to obtain credit\u8212\'20\'14an outcome most lawmakers say they want to avoid.\par \par \uc2 "We maintain our view that Congress is unlikely to pass sweeping, model-busting credit reporting legislation," analysts at \uc2 Compass Point Research & Trading LLC\uc2  wrote in a note last week.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 A Social Network Credit Union? Regulator Asks, \u8216\'20\'18Why Not?'\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 ALEXANDRIA, Va.\u8212\'20\'14Congress should consider allowing credit unions to serve communities that exist only online, the industry's top regulator said\u8212\'20\'14remarks that could stir ire in the banking industry, which competes with credit unions and is fighting their ability to expand their fields of membership.\par \par \uc2 National Credit Union Administration\uc2  Chairman J. Mark McWatters said such a change would better reflect today's society.\par \par \uc2 Under federal law, a credit union can serve a community with a "common bond," a concept that regulators and Congress have expanded over the years. The number of credit-union memberships in the U.S. has moved past 100 million in recent years, but the law still generally limits credit unions' field of membership to pools of people living or working near one another.\par \par \uc2 "We need to think about how we can create common bonds, or how we can reflect in the Federal Credit Union Act, what people today use as common bonds," Mr. McWatters said in an interview this week at the regulator's headquarters. "Chances are [such a change] would be very broad, and chances are it would be something that the bankers might not be totally in love with," he said. "But again I am trying to parallel reality today as opposed to what it was a generation\u8212\'20\'14or two or three or four generations\u8212\'20\'14ago."\par \par \uc2 Mr. McWatters didn't rule out the possibility of a huge social network forming a "common bond" for a big credit union. Pressed on what a web-based credit union might look like, he gave a narrower example\u8212\'20\'14an LGBTQ online community organized around individuals' sexual orientation\u8212\'20\'14as one way credit-union members might form an online-only "common bond."\par \par \uc2 For such a credit union to be created, first Congress would likely have to change the Federal Credit Union Act to tweak the definition of a "common bond." Then the credit-union regulator could evaluate any groups wishing to launch a credit union to serve the online community.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McWatters suggested in June congressional testimony that Congress consider a web-based field of membership, but didn't elaborate on the idea. Last year, he endorsed a regulatory change that expanded how credit unions may define their field of membership.\par \par \uc2 Any further expansion of credit unions' membership would likely be opposed by banks, which have fought for years to limit competition from credit unions. Credit unions enjoy tax exemptions but also can't raise capital or lend as freely as banks.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2  is suing the credit-union regulator over the new field of membership regulations.\par \par \uc2 "The taxpayer-subsidized credit union industry is already exceeding the legal boundaries when it comes to membership, which is why we have asked the courts to intervene," said a spokesman for the bankers association in response to Mr. McWatters's comments. "The fact that NCUA now wants to open the doors even further would be laughable if it wasn't for the fact that taxpayers would once again be left holding the bag."\par \par \uc2 Separately, Mr. McWatters defended his agency's recent decision to take much of the remnants of a fund created to stabilize failing credit unions during the financial crisis and dedicate the money to the federal insurance fund for the industry.\par \par \uc2 Opponents of the decision had been hoping more of the crisis fund would be returned to credit unions. It had a balance of about $2 billion as of the second quarter, thanks in part to legal settlements the regulator won related to crisis-era misdeeds.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McWatters said the agency relied on economic projections from the Federal Reserve and an analysis by \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . to determine that the insurance fund needed more resources to be able to weather a moderate recession.\par \par \uc2 "What [credit unions who oppose the decision] are saying is, \u8216\'20\'18We just want more money,' and I get that," he said. "We have done the numbers\u8230\'20\'26the trade associations and the like that have objected, they have not come back with their numbers. They just come out with something to pull out of the thin blue sky."\par \par \uc2 He said the agency could potentially distribute more funds to credit unions in the future if it judges that risks facing the insurance fund are reduced.\par \par \uc2 The National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions said the agency is being too conservative.\par \par \uc2 "While the regulator may take a completely risk averse position, too risk averse of a position keeps capital out of the markets," said Carrie Hunt, the trade group's general counsel, in a statement. "This is not about disagreeing about forecasts but who is in the best position to make money work for Americans."\par \par \uc2 Mr. McWatters reiterated his plan to revisit a risk-based capital rule for credit unions adopted by his predecessor, saying its structure doesn't hew enough to the Federal Credit Union Act.\par \par \uc2 He also touted a new effort at the agency to explore "virtual examination" of credit unions, including the creation of a team at the agency to study the idea. "Is there a way for us to supervise, from our safety and soundness perspective, these credit unions without being in the face of management all the time?" he said. "I think the answer is, \u8216\'20\'18Yeah, we can.'"\par \par \uc2 Auditor's Decision Deals Blow to U.S. Crackdown on Leveraged Loans\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy and Miriam Gottfried\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14U.S. regulators' crackdown on a risky form of lending to indebted companies was dealt a blow Thursday when a government auditor's ruling raised questions about its future.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  said a document issued by U.S. regulators in 2013, directing banks to beef up underwriting standards for leveraged loans, constituted a formal federal rule. The agencies had contended the document was voluntary guidance.\par \par \uc2 Under the 1996 Congressional Review Act, regulators must notify Congress about rules before they take effect. Regulators never notified Congress about the leveraged lending guidance.\par \par \uc2 The practical impact of the GAO decision wasn't clear. Regardless of the legal status of the 2013 document, regulators have broad powers to crack down on banking practices they view as unsafe or unsound.\par \par \uc2 Representatives of the regulators involved\u8212\'20\'14the Federal Reserve, \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  and \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14declined to comment on the GAO decision.\par \par \uc2 Regulators told the GAO that the guidance was a "statement that explains how they will exercise their broad enforcement discretion [and] does not establish legally binding standards," as a rule does, according to a letter describing the GAO's decision.\par \par \uc2 Legal experts said the GAO decision would diminish regulators' ability to crack down on leveraged lending, which has been a sore point between banks and regulators for years. Leveraged loans are often used to fund private-equity firms' leveraged buyouts of corporations, known as LBOs.\par \par \uc2 "This could transform LBO leverage levels overnight," said Richard Farley, a leveraged finance lawyer with \uc2 Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP\uc2 , referring to the possibility that banks could now facilitate riskier deals without fear of a regulatory reprisal.\par \par \uc2 The GAO was responding to a letter from Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), who had inquired about the legal status of leveraged-lending guidance.\par \par \uc2 "This is an important reminder that agencies have a responsibility to live up to their obligations under the Congressional Review Act," Mr. Toomey said in a statement. "When they don't, Congress should hold them accountable. I will explore steps to do so."\par \par \uc2 One possibility for Mr. Toomey and his Republican colleagues: They could exercise their authority under the act to repeal the leveraged lending policy. That would require approval by simple majority in the House and Senate, and a signature by the president.\par \par \uc2 The Trump administration, in a report issued by the Treasury Department in June, said the leveraged lending guidance wasn't clear enough and should be reissued.\par \par \uc2 Regulators might have difficulty agreeing on how to treat leveraged lending in the short term. One of the three banking overseers, the OCC, is led by an appointee of President Donald Trump, and two are led by appointees of President Barack Obama.\par \par \uc2 Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen & Co., said Trump appointees could act on their own to ease restrictions on leveraged lending. "This guidance already was in trouble," he wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\par \par \uc2 SEC Approves \uc2 Chicago Stock Exchange\uc2 's \u8216\'20\'18Speed Bump' for Trading\par \par \uc2 By Alexander Osipovich\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  has approved a plan by the tiny \uc2 Chicago Stock Exchange\uc2  to introduce a new "speed bump," a person familiar with the situation said.\par \par \uc2 The Chicago exchange's speed bump is a brief delay designed to help protect slower traders from certain high-frequency trading strategies, and the SEC's decision comes as several other exchanges have also experimented with such delays.\par \par \uc2 An SEC spokesman wasn't immediately available for comment.\par \par \uc2 The decision marks a win for the Chicago bourse, which has been trying to sell itself to a group of Chinese and U.S. investors, in a deal that has fueled opposition on Capitol Hill amid fears it could expose U.S. markets to Chinese hacking.\par \par \uc2 That deal is in limbo as it awaits a vote by the SEC's commissioners. CHX Holdings Inc., parent company of the Chicago exchange, denies that its proposed sale would endanger U.S. markets.\par \par \uc2 CHX's speed bump plan, which it unveiled in August 2016 and amended several times since then, could help the beleaguered Chicago exchange boost its volumes. The exchange's share of U.S. stock-trading volume has tumbled from more than 5% in 1990 to less than 0.5%, according to \uc2 Tabb Group\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Under a recent amendment to its plan, the \uc2 Chicago Stock Exchange\uc2  will first run a 24-month pilot program to allow regulators to see how it impacts the markets, before making the speed bump a permanent feature.\par \par \uc2 "We appreciate the opportunity to implement our pilot program and demonstrate [the plan's] positive effect on market quality," CHX Chief Executive Officer John Kerin said in an emailed statement.\par \par \uc2 The plan sparked opposition from some big trading firms, who say it would harm the integrity of U.S. markets.\par \par \uc2 Like \uc2 IEX Group\uc2 , the upstart exchange made famous by Michael Lewis's book "Flash Boys," the Chicago market will introduce a delay of 350 microseconds, or millionths of a second, on incoming trades.\par \par \uc2 Unlike IEX's speed bump, though, the Chicago exchange's speed bump won't apply equally to all trades. Instead, market-makers\u8212\'20\'14the firms that post a steady stream of orders to buy or sell stocks\u8212\'20\'14will be able to engage in much of their trading activity without being subjected to a 350-microsecond delay.\par \par \uc2 Under the amended CHX plan, a group of so-called "LEAD Market Makers" will be able to cancel many of their orders and adjust the prices they are quoting on the Chicago exchange without waiting 350 microseconds.\par \par \uc2 That could help shield them from being "picked off" by high-speed traders who detect that the price of a stock is about to change and try to profit by buying if its price is about to rise or selling if it is about to fall\u8212\'20\'14at the expense of the slower-moving market maker.\par \par \uc2 Large electronic trading firms including \uc2 Citadel Securities LLC\uc2  opposed the plan, saying it unfairly discriminated between market participants. But others, including \uc2 Virtu Financial LLC\uc2 , supported the plan.\par \par \uc2 Besides IEX, the New York Stock Exchange has also introduced a 350-microsecond speed bump on one of its smaller sister exchanges, NYSE American.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Treasury Official: Remarks on Size of Clearinghouses \u8216\'20\'18May Have Been Misinterpreted'\par \par \uc2 By Gabriel T. Rubin\par \par \uc2 CHICAGO\u8212\'20\'14A senior Treasury Department official tried to dispel worries about the resiliency of clearinghouses on Thursday, saying some of the department's recent remarks on the financial market utilities "may have been misinterpreted."\par \par \uc2 A report on capital markets by the Treasury Department released earlier in October detailed the expanding role of clearinghouses and recommended ways to strengthen their ability to withstand a crisis situation. National Economic Council Director \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2  earlier this week separately said the growing amount of illiquid assets parked in clearinghouses raises concerns about a "new systemic problem in the system."\par \par \uc2 Craig Phillips, counsel to Treasury Secretary \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2  and the department's regulatory point person, said, "The work of planning for recovery and resolution [of clearinghouses] remains incomplete." Speaking at a Chicago derivatives industry conference, he added that the fact those plans haven't been completed "probably shows that people have confidence" in clearinghouses' ability to withstand a crisis.\par \par \uc2 He also said the Dodd-Frank Act mandate to clear swaps has been successful while at the same time raising questions about the recovery and resolution of large clearinghouses.\par \par \uc2 Clearinghouses, mostly used by banks and investment firms, are meant to help avoid a marketwide collapse by ensuring that either party in a derivatives transaction is paid if the other side falters. Their role has grown since the 2008 financial crisis as regulators encouraged derivatives to be routed through them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cohn raised questions about the clearinghouse structure on Sunday at a Group of 30 banking seminar in Washington. "I don't think we really understand the magnitude of continuously putting things in clearinghouses without the proper guardrails in the clearinghouse," he said.\par \par \uc2 A day after Mr. Cohn's comments, the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  released the results of "stress tests" conducted on major clearinghouses to gauge their ability to withstand a crisis, and all of the tested entities passed.\par \par \uc2 U.K. Regulator Asks Banks to Probe Links With South Africa's Gupta Family\par \par \uc2 By Margot Patrick in London and Gabriele Steinhauser in Johannesburg\par \par \uc2 HSBC Holdings PLC\uc2  and \uc2 Standard Chartered PLC\uc2  have been asked by the U.K. financial regulator to review possible business with South Africa's Gupta family, becoming the latest firms to be hit by the fallout from a corruption scandal in Africa's most developed economy.\par \par \uc2 After a request from U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond, the \uc2 U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  said Thursday it has been in contact with the two banks about their possible dealings with the family and "will consider carefully further responses received."\par \par \uc2 Standard Chartered in a statement said it shut down some accounts linked to the Guptas in 2014 after an internal investigation. \uc2 HSBC\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 South African police and prosecutors have said they are investigating allegations of corruption, including potential kickbacks from international companies, which were brought to light by a flood of emails and other documents that appear to have been obtained from Gupta-controlled companies. The documents have buttressed longstanding suspicions among many South Africans that the powerful business clan leveraged its connection to President Jacob Zuma and other government officials to amass great personal wealth.\par \par \uc2 The Guptas and Mr. Zuma have denied wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 The scandal so far has ensnared international firms including \uc2 KPMG International\uc2 , \uc2 SAP SE\uc2  and \uc2 McKinsey & Co\uc2 ., and led to the collapse of the U.K. arm of public relations firm Bell Pottinger over its work for a Gupta holding company.\par \par \uc2 KPMG, which audited Gupta companies for 15 years, last month removed the leadership of its South African branch after an internal probe found it fell short of its own standards during the 15 years it audited Gupta companies.\par \par \uc2 McKinsey this week said it had disciplined some staff for violating professional standards on a contract with a South African company that was owned by a close associate of the Guptas. \uc2 SAP\uc2  said it would release the findings of an internal investigation over alleged kickbacks to a Gutpa company by the end of this month.\par \par \uc2 KPMG and McKinsey have denied any wrongdoing. \uc2 SAP\uc2 's South African office denied the allegations of kickbacks when they first surfaced in media reports in July, but the statement was removed from the company's website days later when the software maker launched the internal probe. A spokesman has declined to comment on why the statement was removed.\par \par \uc2 Peter Hain, a former cabinet minister and a member of the House of Lords, confirmed on Thursday that he had written to Mr. Hammond last month about allegations by a whistleblower that \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and Standard Chartered may have inadvertently served as conduits for corrupt proceeds. An exchange of letters between Mr. Hain and the Treasury became public on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "We take allegations of financial misconduct very seriously, and have passed Lord Hain's letter on to the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  and relevant U.K. law enforcement agencies, including the National Crime Agency and Serious Fraud Office, to agree the right action," a Treasury spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 The NCA and SFO said they are aware of the matter.\par \par \uc2 According to documents that appear to have been come from a Gupta company hard drive, and which have been reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, several Standard Chartered accounts were used in 2013 to transfer money between Gupta-controlled companies in South Africa and Dubai to pay for a lavish family wedding.\par \par \uc2 The documents also show that the funds originated from a government contract to run a dairy farm for poor black South Africans. Standard Chartered has previously said that it closed the accounts used the in transactions in early 2014.\par \par \uc2 The U.K. regulators request to the banks comes after Indonesia officials last week said they are probing holders of $1.4 billion in trust accounts at Standard Chartered for possible tax due.\par \par \uc2 The transfer of the accounts in 2015 from Guernsey and Singapore prompted investigations by regulators around the bank's anti-money laundering checks on customers.\par \par \uc2 Both banks have so-called deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. over failings in their anti-money laundering controls, among other breaches. As part of the agreements to avoid criminal prosecution, \uc2 HSBC\uc2  and Standard Chartered have spent billions of dollars improving their compliance systems..\par \par \uc2 Trump Announces Nominees for Two FTC Vacancies\par \par \uc2 By Brent Kendall\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14President Donald Trump on Thursday announced nominees for two longstanding vacancies at the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2 , which has been short-handed at an unprecedented level with three empty seats.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said he intended to nominate private antitrust lawyer Joseph Simons as FTC chairman. Mr. Simons, who has been co-chair of the antitrust practice at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, is well known in antitrust circles. He previously served as the director of the FTC's bureau of competition during the George W. Bush era.\par \par \uc2 The president also announced plans to nominate Rohit Chopra, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Education Department, for another FTC vacancy.\par \par \uc2 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) recommended Mr. Chopra, who would fill a Democratic seat.

But despite a political furor over the breach, demonstrated by no fewer than five congressional hearings into either Equifax or the companies' business model, it remains unclear if Congress\u8212\'20\'14consumed with other priorities\u8212\'20\'14will pass a bill to turn the screws on the firms.\par \par \uc2 In the House, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.) {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/key-house-republican-plans-bill-to-rein-in-credit-bureaus-after-equifax-hack-1507802400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 introduced sweeping legislation last week}}}\uc2  to require the three major credit-reporting firms\u8212\'20\'14Equifax, \uc2 Experian PLC\uc2  and TransUnion\u8212\'20\'14to submit to federal cybersecurity reviews for the first time, provide free credit freezes for certain groups of consumers and phase out their use of Social Security numbers to verify consumers' identities. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2yBwLws"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The bill}}}\uc2  is largely a starting point for the Financial Services Committee to build on, according to congressional aides.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile in the Senate, David Perdue (R., Ga.) on Wednesday {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2yAPurx"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 introduced nearly identical legislation}}}\uc2  to Mr. McHenry's. The Senate bill excludes cybersecurity reviews in deference to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho), who is reviewing gaps in the regulatory structure. The Georgia lawmaker, according to people familiar with his thinking, didn't want to lay down a marker on the issue until Mr. Crapo's work is further along.\par \par \uc2 In hearings, Mr. Crapo has said he found the hack shocking and urged a "meaningful discussion" about how to protect and limit access to consumers' personal information. He is also pressing banking regulators on whether they need more authority to supervise the credit-reporting firms to ensure they adequately protect consumer data. "I am concerned there may be a regulatory gap with respect to supervision of credit reporting agencies for data security standards," he wrote in a letter to the heads of the Federal Reserve, \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  and \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . last week. Mr. Crapo asked the policy makers to respond by today.\par \par \uc2 Though neither existing bill has any co-sponsors, analysts say Mr. McHenry's bill could eventually clear the House\u8212\'20\'14a chamber where the North Carolina lawmaker serves as the chief deputy whip and holds significant sway among fellow Republicans. But its fate is far murkier in the Senate, where Democrats hold more clout than in the House and might push for a more aggressive response that upends the companies' business models.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on Mr. Crapo's panel, has noted that consumers have more control over their personal medical data, and questioned why similar standards shouldn't be applied to financial information.\par \par \uc2 Such comments raise questions about how the industry can be overhauled, and whether doing so would make it harder or more cumbersome for consumers to obtain credit\u8212\'20\'14an outcome most lawmakers say they want to avoid.\par \par \uc2 "We maintain our view that Congress is unlikely to pass sweeping, model-busting credit reporting legislation," analysts at \uc2 Compass Point Research & Trading LLC\uc2  wrote in a note last week.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 A Social Network Credit Union? Regulator Asks, \u8216\'20\'18Why Not?'\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-credit-union-regulator-asks-why-not-1508493601"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Congress should consider}}}\uc2  allowing credit unions to serve communities that exist only online, the industry's top regulator said\u8212\'20\'14remarks that could stir ire in the banking industry, which competes with credit unions and is fighting their ability to expand their fields of membership.\par \par \uc2 National Credit Union Administration\uc2  Chairman J. Mark McWatters said such a change would better reflect today's society.\par \par \uc2 Under federal law, a credit union can serve a community with a "common bond," a concept that regulators and Congress have expanded over the years. The number of credit-union memberships in the U.S. has moved past 100 million in recent years, but the law still generally limits credit unions' field of membership to pools of people living or working near one another.\par \par \uc2 Auditor's Decision Deals Blow to U.S. Crackdown on Leveraged Loans\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/auditors-decision-deals-blow-to-u-s-crackdown-on-leveraged-loans-1508445534"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. regulators' crackdown on a risky form}}}\uc2  of lending to indebted companies was dealt a blow Thursday when a government auditor's ruling raised questions about its future.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  said a document issued by U.S. regulators in 2013, directing banks to beef up underwriting standards for leveraged loans, constituted a formal federal rule. The agencies had contended the document was voluntary guidance. Under the 1996 Congressional Review Act, regulators must notify Congress about rules before they take effect. Regulators never notified Congress about the leveraged lending guidance.\par \par \uc2 The practical impact of the GAO decision wasn't clear. Legal experts said the move would diminish regulators' ability to crack down on leveraged lending, which has been a sore point between banks and regulators for years.\par \par \uc2 SEC Approves Chicago Stock Exchange's \u8216\'20\'18Speed Bump' for Trading\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-approves-chicago-stock-exchanges-speed-bump-for-trading-1508453511"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved}}}\uc2  a plan by the tiny Chicago Stock Exchange to introduce a new "speed bump," a person familiar with the situation said.\par \par \uc2 The Chicago exchange's speed bump is a brief delay designed to help protect slower traders from certain high-frequency trading strategies, and the SEC's decision comes as several other exchanges have also experimented with such delays.\par \par \uc2 The decision marks a win for the Chicago bourse, which has been trying to sell itself to a group of Chinese and U.S. investors, in a deal that has fueled opposition on Capitol Hill amid fears it could expose U.S. markets to Chinese hacking.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Treasury Official: Remarks on Size of Clearinghouses \u8216\'20\'18May Have Been Misinterpreted'\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-official-remarks-on-size-of-clearinghouses-may-have-been-misinterpreted-1508431076"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 A senior Treasury Department official tried}}}\uc2  to dispel worries about the resiliency of clearinghouses on Thursday, saying some of the department's recent remarks on the financial market utilities "may have been misinterpreted."\par \par \uc2 A report on capital markets by the Treasury Department released earlier in October detailed the expanding role of clearinghouses and recommended ways to strengthen their ability to withstand a crisis situation. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn earlier this week separately said the growing amount of illiquid assets parked in clearinghouses raises concerns about a "new systemic problem in the system."\par \par \uc2 Craig Phillips, counsel to Treasury Secretary \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2  and the department's regulatory point person, said, "The work of planning for recovery and resolution [of clearinghouses] remains incomplete." Speaking at a Chicago derivatives industry conference, he added that the fact those plans haven't been completed "probably shows that people have confidence" in clearinghouses' ability to withstand a crisis.\par \par \uc2 U.K. Regulator Asks Banks to Probe Links With South Africa's Gupta Family\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-regulator-asks-banks-to-probe-links-with-south-africas-gupta-family-1508420850"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC}}}\uc2  have been asked by the U.K. financial regulator to review possible business with South Africa's Gupta family, becoming the latest firms to be hit by the fallout from a corruption scandal in Africa's most developed economy.\par \par \uc2 After a request from U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond, the \uc2 U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  said Thursday it has been in contact with the two banks about their possible dealings with the family and "will consider carefully further responses received."\par \par \uc2 Standard Chartered in a statement said it shut down some accounts linked to the Guptas in 2014 after an internal investigation. \uc2 HSBC\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Trump Announces Nominees for Two FTC Vacancies\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-announces-nominees-for-two-ftc-vacancies-1508453261"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 President Donald Trump on Thursday announced}}}\uc2  nominees for two longstanding vacancies at the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2 , which has been short-handed at an unprecedented level with three empty seats.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump said he intended to nominate private antitrust lawyer Joseph Simons as FTC chairman. Mr. Simons, who has been co-chair of the antitrust practice at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, is well known in antitrust circles. He previously served as the director of the FTC's bureau of competition during the George W. Bush era.\par \par \uc2 The president also announced plans to nominate Rohit Chopra, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Education Department, for another FTC vacancy. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) recommended Mr. Chopra, who would fill a Democratic seat.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-talk-daily-analysis-roundup-1508448182"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Read our compilation of concise, timely analysis}}}\uc2  by Wall Street Journal reporters.

True believers argue bitcoin is different, and its price rise is justified because it is the future of money. The history of bubbles suggests that's unlikely but not impossible: Boston fund manager GMO found that one in seven price moves that look like a bubble turns out to be a paradigm shift.\par \par \uc2 Investors trying to spot the next big theme need to beware of thinking they are early when they are late, as they might be with bitcoin. They also need to be ready to sell if it looks like a bubble is developing and to have the strength not to be sucked back in if the bubble keeps going for a long time.\par \par \uc2 Friday, Oct. 20\par \par \uc2 10:30 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Brookings Institution\uc2 's Center on Regulation and Markets holds a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.brookings.edu/events/can-trumps-ambitious-deregulatory-agenda-succeed/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 panel discussion}}}\uc2  on President Donald Trump's Executive Order, which requires two regulations be eliminated for every new regulation issued and established an administration-wide regulatory budget.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday, Oct. 24\par \par \uc2 NA\par \par \uc2 SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, and Treasury secretary adviser Craig Phillips, speak at \uc2 the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association\uc2 's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sifma.org/event/sifma-annual-meeting/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 annual meeting}}}\uc2  in Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 10 a.m.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Banking Committee holds a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2yuwtb6"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 hearing}}}\uc2  on the nominations of Hester Peirce and Robert Jackson to be members of the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 What Explains Shareholder Payouts by Large Banks?\par \par \uc2 Beverly Hirtle, research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, explores how banks' payouts to shareholders have increased since the financial crisis and describes how the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review has affected the composition of payouts between dividends and share repurchases. While there is little evidence of greater caution about dividends at non-CCAR banks, CCAR banks "may have been reluctant to reduce dividends because dividend cuts are generally seen as negative signals about a firm's future prospects and profitability," the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/10/what-explains-shareholder-payouts-by-large-banks.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Liberty Street Economics post}}}\uc2  says.

The analysis also doesn't estimate the cost of reduced access to investment advice or show that the rule is the best approach to maximize net benefits, he says. For example, the analysis doesn't address costs that could arise if the SEC chooses to issue its own version of the rule, which could result in conflicting regulatory standards for U.S. brokers, he says.\par \par \uc2 Driven by concerns about Russian online activity during the 2016 election, two senior Senate Democrats {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/proposed-honest-ads-act-seeks-more-disclosure-about-online-political-ads-1508440260"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 introduced campaign finance legislation}}}\uc2  that would force greater disclosure about the political advertising that runs online.\par \par \uc2 A federal judge sentenced Thomas C.

The "Cash Conference" in San Francisco focused on the topic Thursday, organized by the Economic Security Project, a group cofounded by \uc2 Facebook\uc2  cofounder Chris Hughes.\par \par \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 's research arm is moving ahead with an ambitious project on basic income, which has support of the group's president, \uc2 Sam Altman\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 's effort recently resulted in a finished a feasibility study in Oakland, Calif., and it announced plans to run a randomized controlled trial in two U.S. states on basic income. That plan includes 1,000 people receiving $1,000 per month for up to five years and 2,000 people receiving $50 per month as a control group to compare.\par \par \uc2 Participants are eager to be part of YC's study and are willing to share personal quantitative and qualitative information, including what they spend money on and what they do with their time. "We feel confident moving forward this is something we can do," said Elizabeth Rhodes, research director for the project.\par \par \uc2 Basic income is not a panacea that alone will solve all social problems, she said, but the study could help identify problems that cash could or could not solve. "Basic income is neither a silver bullet nor a singular policy option," Ms. Rhodes said.\par \par \uc2 YC's research project is separate from YC the investment firm, but individuals at the firm are able to help and provide advice, particularly if technology is needed for the research or for collecting data, she said. The project aims to stay out of the political debates on basic income, though basic income if it grows would become a policy issue.\par \par \uc2 Basic income could also make entrepreneurship more accessible for more people, said Roy Bahat of \uc2 Bloomberg Beta\uc2 . He relayed an anecdote from the head of a tech accelerator. "Here's a dirty secret. All the best founders are rich already," the person told Bahat. "Silicon valley startups are the exception not the rule."\par \par \uc2 Research is increasing on the idea. The Economic Security Project on Wednesday announced a $1 million grant to test basic income in Stockton, Calif.\par \par \uc2 "The most effective thing we can do is give money," said Mr. Hughes. "It isn't a silver bullet, but it's been so rigorously researched," he said, pointing to studies in other countries.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171020edak0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that his speech was Thursday. (10/18) \par \par \uc2 BEIJING\u8212\'20\'14China's economy expanded at a robust 6.8% pace in the third quarter, meeting market expectations, as traditional growth drivers such as manufacturing and exports gained steam.\par \par \uc2 The strong showing is welcome news for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-xi-feeds-expectations-for-a-lengthy-reign-1508333178"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Communist Party leaders gathering for a twice-a-decade conclave in Beijing }}}\uc2 . To prepare for the event, which is expected to strengthen President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 's reign over the nation for years to come, various levels of government have for months mounted massive efforts to keep the world's second-largest economy on an even keel.\par \par \uc2 The third-quarter pace slowed from 6.9% in the second quarter, though it puts the full-year target set by the leadership for growth of about 6.5% well within reach. Adding to a sense of optimism in official circles, China's central-bank \uc2 Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan\uc2  said just days ahead of the political conclave that second-half growth could reach 7%.\par \par \uc2 Increased industrial activity and higher commodity prices were major reasons behind the strong growth. The latter, partly a result of policies to cut overcapacity, benefited state-owned manufacturers in particular. That is because the capacity cuts led to the closures of many private firms, especially in industries like coal and metals.\par \par \uc2 Recovering global demand also helped, giving China some economic breathing room, which has meant an economic slowdown that many expected hasn't materialized.\par \par \uc2 Industrial production, a main gauge of manufacturing activity, rose 6.6% in September from a year earlier, according to data released Thursday by the National Bureau of Statistics. Retail sales jumped 10.3%, though the pace of growth slowed from the first half of the year, indicating consumers have grown wary of opening their wallets.\par \par \uc2 Analysts say increased output was largely driven by state firms that have seen a sharp rebound in profits this year. In the first nine months of 2017, according to official data, large state firms controlled by the central government\u8212\'20\'14which dominate China's smokestack industries\u8212\'20\'14saw their profits jump 18.4% from a year earlier to 1.1 trillion yuan ($167 billion).\par \par \uc2 Still-solid property investment, despite government efforts to cool the housing market, has also increased demand for steel, furniture and other materials, helping to lift profits in the manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, a global economic recovery has helped Chinese exporters.\par \par \uc2 This doesn't mean China has entered a new cycle of accelerating growth, economists warn. To keep near-term growth steady, Beijing has delayed fixing some of its long-running problems, such as industrial overcapacity and excessive debt. That, in turn, economists say, means risks for a prolonged slowdown in the economy are rising, not declining.\par \par \uc2 Economists also have long questioned whether the government's statistics reflect the true state of the economy. The \uc2 Conference Board\uc2 , a nonprofit research firm, estimates that China's growth rate is around 4%.\par \par \uc2 In a speech Wednesday that marked the opening of the party congress, Mr. Xi laid out a sweeping plan to transform China into a strong global power that stresses expanding the party's control over the economy and all other corners of the nation. But unlike his predecessor, who said China's national income would double over a decade, Mr. Xi outlined his vision without specifying a broad target for economic expansion, even as he reaffirmed Beijing's commitment to development.\par \par \uc2 The omission indicated "a subtle de-emphasizing of specific growth targets," said UBS China economist Wang Tao. Ms. Wang projects that the government will soften its growth target slightly for next year.\par \par \uc2 But to tackle the economy's long-term ills, some analysts say, Beijing may need to significantly lower its annual growth targets. So far, there have been few signs that the government is willing to accept the trade-off.\par \par \uc2 A recent survey by China Beige Book, a data provider that tracks China's economy, of more than 3,000 Chinese companies shows that from July through September, hundreds of coal, steel, aluminum and copper companies reported a sixth straight quarter of overall capacity rising, not falling. Meanwhile, after a brief slowdown in credit growth, Chinese banks handed out more loans last month, indicating Beijing's preference for near-term stability over any drop in economic activity.\par \par \uc2 "This will not persist," said Yukon Huang, a former country director at the World Bank in China, referring to the near-term recovery of China's economy.\par \par \uc2 "Long-term growth depends on more fundamental drivers such as productivity growth," said Mr. Huang, who is now a senior fellow at the \uc2 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\uc2 .

\par\par {\*\bkmkstart toc15}{\*\bkmkend toc15}\b \uc2 Tough times loom for \uc2 LSE\uc2  after Rolet bows out\b0\par\par\uc2 Philip Stafford in London \par \uc2 1,208 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2017\par 19:00\par \uc2 Financial Times (FT.Com)\par \uc2 FTCOM\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

However, the deal fell apart and the next incumbent will need to reshape the company from the model that Mr Rolet created nearly a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 Less than a year before Mr Rolet\u8217\'20\'19s arrival as chief executive, the home to the shares of some of Europe\u8217\'20\'19s biggest banks, suffered an IT glitch for seven hours just days before \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  collapsed.\par \par \uc2 Investors \u8212\'20\'14 who had watched the exchange lose market share to new cheaper competition and turn down takeover attempts from bigger rivals \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  and \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 were aghast.\par \par \uc2 Now, its $17bn market capitalisation makes it the world\u8217\'20\'19s fifth largest exchange, and bigger than \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI would expect the vacancy to attract a high-profile candidate with M&A experience and for the board to look internationally. Today\u8217\'20\'19s figures highlight that the business is in great shape,\u8221\'20\'1D says Trevor Green, head of UK equities at \uc2 Aviva Investors\uc2 , a long-term \uc2 LSE\uc2  shareholder.\par \par \uc2 The first of the many deals completed in Mr Rolet\u8217\'20\'19s tenure was the $30m purchase of MillienniumIT to fix defective technology.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 LSE\uc2  was a mid-sized company that had missed out on several prized industry assets, notably the Liffe derivatives exchange.\par \par \uc2 Instead Mr Rolet, a former Goldman and Lehman banker, spent his time building closer relationships with big banks and spending more than \u163\'00\'A34bn on data and clearing businesses as markets evolved after the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 Deals for index compilers \uc2 Russell Investments\uc2  and the 50 per cent it did not own in \uc2 FTSE International\uc2  were made in response to changing trends in fund management; the purchase of a controlling stake in LCH, the clearing house, was to exploit new rules demanding that more over-the-counter derivatives deals negotiated by banks were processed through the independent risk managers.\par \par \uc2 He has also focused on developing small and medium businesses from around the world, either to list or develop in a mentoring programme.\par \par \uc2 As a consequence, \uc2 LSE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s operating profits have risen from \u163\'00\'A3182m on revenues of \u163\'00\'A3605m in 2010 to \u163\'00\'A3426.8m on revenues of \u163\'00\'A31.5bn. \u8220\'20\'1CAt times we took risks, we made a few moves, sometimes they could be qualified as bold moves,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Rolet told analysts on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Mr Rolet has at least paved the way for the board to attract candidates from across financial markets. In her final year his predecessor \uc2 Clara Furse\uc2  was paid a base salary of \u163\'00\'A3540,000 with a bonus of \u163\'00\'A3648,000. Mr Rolet\u8217\'20\'19s base salary is \u163\'00\'A3800,000 and his total remuneration last year was \u163\'00\'A35.7m, down from \u163\'00\'A36.5m a year ago.\par \par \uc2 But below the revenue and profit growth, his successor inherits problems.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a lack of technical integration across a number of the assets. The organisation is quite siloed and that may impact performance without a strong and respected leader,\u8221\'20\'1D says Jake Pugh, an industry consultant.\par \par \uc2 Indicating the cost pressure in the fund management industry, this week \uc2 State Street\uc2  abandoned three FTSE exchange-trade funds benchmarks in favour of an in-house alternative.\par \par \uc2 A future chief executive will have to deal with the UK\u8217\'20\'19s departure from the \uc2 EU\uc2  as \uc2 LSE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s French clearing house and \uc2 Borsa Italiana\uc2  will remain inside the bloc. The successor will also have to address Europe\u8217\'20\'19s new incoming markets rules, known as Mifid II. The legislation will mandate greater transparency and competition in fixed income and derivatives markets, areas at which Mr Rolet has directed much of the \uc2 LSE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s attention in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Mr Rolet had been a big backer of the rule changes that give fund managers and banks more choice over what and where they trade. At a conference in Paris this week, he likened the current market to someone being forced to buy all insurance from the same place, bundled together.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat would not make any sense to you, particularly in the age of internet and comparison sites. So why should the financial industry, the futures market in particular, continue to operate that way?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Brussels may change the rules once the UK has left the \uc2 EU\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the biggest issue Mr Rolet\u8217\'20\'19s successor will face is the one that has dogged \uc2 LSE\uc2  since the turn of the century, the one that Mr Rolet tried to resolve with the \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse\uc2  deal \u8212\'20\'14 its independence.\par \par \uc2 For now uncertainty over the UK\u8217\'20\'19s future has deterred potential bidders. A successor may have to come up with another answer.\par \par \uc2 Hunt for successor could take up to a year\par \par \uc2 Hiring and installing a successor to \uc2 Xavier Rolet\uc2  could take up to a year, the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  admitted, as it said the chief executive would leave by the end of December 2018.\par \par \uc2 LSE\uc2  said it would work closely with Mr Rolet to find a new chief and would look internally and externally to find the right candidate.\par \par \uc2 Few names emerged on Thursday, although analysts and executives expect there to be no shortage of interest.\par \par \uc2 With Mr Rolet\u8217\'20\'19s appointment in 2009, the \uc2 LSE\uc2  was among the first exchanges to recruit a former investment banker as its chief executive \u8212\'20\'14 a now-common industry trend. Evolving markets and exchange strategies could mean \uc2 LSE\uc2  again bucks the norm.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe board will probably conduct a broad international search, and could seek candidates that have established careers in either information services or post-trade businesses, not in the traditional trading arena that exchange groups are historically known for,\u8221\'20\'1D said Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\par \par \uc2 For many years the industry touted \uc2 David Lester\uc2 , Mr Rolet\u8217\'20\'19s head of strategy and the architect of many of his deals, as a potential successor.\par \par \uc2 However Mr Lester left over the summer after more than 16 years at the \uc2 LSE\uc2  to pursue other interests.\par \par \uc2 One potential internal candidate is Mark Makepeace, group director of information services, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of \uc2 LSE\uc2  profits. He was also a driving force in \uc2 LSE\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s last big deal, the $685m purchase of \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s global bond \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business in August.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171019edaj0093t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Venture capitalists have been opening their wallets for \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  startups automating business conversations, from sales to customer support calls.\par \par \uc2 Mya Systems Inc. is applying this technology, known as \b \highlight22\uc2 natural language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2 , to recruiting and hiring. When companies receive a large number of applications, Mya's chatbot helps screen candidates by asking them questions about their resume and scheduling interviews with them through SMS messages.\par \par \uc2 The company said on Thursday it had raised $18 million in Series B funding. With the new funding, the company plans to roll out its product in multiple languages by next year.\par \par \uc2 Foundation Capital\uc2  led the round, with participation from \uc2 Emergence Capital\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Forrester Analyst \uc2 Rob Koplowitz\uc2  said language expansion is very difficult because most \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  systems are taught a very specific brand of English. He said many machines can't handle accents and dialects, let alone support multiple languages.\par \par \uc2 "You don't just have to teach it the language," Mr. Koplowitz said. "You have to teach it the idiomatic language."\par \par \uc2 Mya may have an advantage as it pushes into new international markets because it can apply its subject matter expertise in recruiting, Mr. Koplowitz said. He said they're not just teaching the machines a new language, they're teaching it recruiting terminology in those languages.\par \par \uc2 Launched in 2012, the company has raised about $30 million in venture funding to date. Mya Chief Executive Eyal Grayevsky said the company supports three of the world's five largest recruiting agencies, including \uc2 Adecco\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mya's advantage in expanding its languages it supports lies in its customers and partners, Foundation Capital Partner Joanne Chen said.\par \par \uc2 Mya has access to some of the largest recruiting data sets in the world through partners, Ms. Chen said. "With translation, it's just a data problem," she said.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, so-called chatbots have been hyped as AI technology, though not all efforts have been breakthrough innovations.\par \par \uc2 "There is a lot of hype around chatbots, but there is also a great deal of promise in the long-term," Ms. Chen said.\par \par \uc2 Consumer-facing chatbots have faltered, she said, but chatbots in the enterprise have been able to provide value by helping companies cut costs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grayevsky said Mya is committed to creating a seamless experience for recruiters and job candidates, no matter what language Mya is using to communicate with applicants. According to a survey the company conducted with prospective employees, 72% of job candidates thought Mya was a human.\par \par \uc2 "It only takes one bad experience," Mr. Grayevsky said, "to lose trust with the user or candidate."\par \par \uc2 Write to Cat Zakrzewski at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cat.zakrzewski@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171019edaj005mt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Overall in 2017, more money has flowed out of such funds than has flowed in, EPFR data show, even as the Dow has climbed to 51 fresh highs this year. A surge in stock buybacks and growing inflows from foreign investors and sovereign-wealth funds helped offset outflows from U.S. stock funds.\par \par \uc2 Many investors are concerned that the steady rise in U.S. indexes has left shares looking expensive. They also recently have grappled with elevated tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, hurricane-related disruptions to the economy and signals that the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  is planning to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-keeps-december-rate-rise-on-the-table-eyes-slower-path-for-increases-1505930513"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 raise interest rates further}}}\uc2  and wind down its unprecedented {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fed-a-decade-after-the-crisis-is-about-to-embark-on-the-great-unwinding-1505746843"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 asset-purchase program.}}}\par \par \uc2 The S&P 500 hasn't suffered a daily pullback of 3% or more since Nov. 4, the longest stretch without a decline of that magnitude since the mid-1990s. So far this year the Dow has surged 17%, compared with the S&P 500's 14% rise. Some investors worry that means stocks are overdue for a substantial selloff.\par \par \uc2 Others think the money leaving U.S. stock funds is a positive development. The outflows have coincided with elevated cash holdings and could signal major indexes can climb even higher. They figure with less invested in U.S. stock funds, there is plenty of money to put back in if investors get more optimistic.\par \par \uc2 These analysts and investors reckon some caution is healthy in a rising market. What would make them worry that a peak may be near, they say, is the kind of exuberance they remember seeing from investors in the dot-com boom in the late-1990s.\par \par \uc2 "As we hit milestones, it creates a lot of dialogue around 'oh my goodness the market is at all-time highs yet again,'" said \uc2 Erik Davidson\uc2 , chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. He said investors he speaks with are happy their stock portfolios are going up, but they're also perplexed, concerned about news out of Washington, D.C., North Korea and natural disasters.\par \par \uc2 That worry makes Mr. Davidson feel more confident about the market's climb.\par \par \uc2 "The skepticism is healthy.

Before that, the last time money flowed in was March, capping a stretch of inflows that began the month of the U.S. election.\par \par \uc2 The amount of cash in investors' portfolios remains elevated historically, even though cash balances slipped to their lowest level in 2\u189\'00\'BD years in October, according to a \uc2 Bank of America Merrill Lynch\uc2  survey of fund managers, which took into account responses from 179 fund managers with $516 billion in assets.\par \par \uc2 Stocks' climb has coincided with a recovery in U.S. corporate earnings, which slumped for several quarters before resuming growth in the second half of last year.\par \par \uc2 America's biggest companies are generally projected to report earnings growth again for the third quarter, even though expectations have been tempered in part because of the impact of major summer storms on insurers and other firms. As of the end of last month, analysts expected earnings at S&P 500 companies to rise 4.2% in the third quarter, according to FactSet.\par \par \uc2 "Investors continue to say there is a pretty positive story in terms of earnings growth," said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equities at \uc2 Lazard Asset Management\uc2 . "The core underpinnings of the market's strength is better than they have been in a long time."\par \par \uc2 Company stock repurchases have helped support share prices, some analysts say. In the second quarter, companies in the S&P 500 bought back $120 billion worth of stock, according to data from \uc2 S&P Dow Jones Indices\uc2 . Many analysts expect share repurchases among S&P 500 companies continued at a similar pace in the third quarter, though data aren't yet available. Buybacks can lift stock prices because they can decrease the number of shares available in the market, though some investors say they would rather companies spend that money on business development and expansion.\par \par \uc2 Yield-seekers outside the U.S. also could account for some of the stock market's gains.\par \par \uc2 Foreign investors have put roughly a net $40 billion into U.S. stocks so far this year through August, compared with more than $3.5 billion in net outflows last year, according to Deutsche Bank Global Markets Research.\par \par \uc2 The expectation that interest rates would rise slowly in the U.S. "is an important reason behind why we've seen an increase in allocation from foreigners,"\u8203\'20\'0Bsaid Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  has been gradually raising short-term interest rates since late 2015, and the central bank signaled that it is considering another increase in December. Interest rates have been ultralow in developed economies around the world since the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 State-owned investment funds have snapped up U.S. equities. In 2017 through the end of August, about $5.1 billion in money directly from sovereign-wealth funds has flowed into U.S. stocks, according to data from the \uc2 Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute\uc2 . The data don't include money allocated to external fund managers, who in turn could invest in stocks.\par \par \uc2 Few analysts and investors see an imminent end to the rally that has taken the Dow industrials to several milestones since the election. The Dow advanced from 20000 to 21000 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-markets-higher-ahead-of-trump-address-1488332430"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in just 24 trading days}}}\uc2  in March, tied for the fastest thousand-point gain in the index's history.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Big investment banks are pushing to stoke more fully automated trading in the $6 trillion market for investment-grade corporate debt.\par \par \uc2 Banks including \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  have unleashed new trading software systems in recent months to pick up share.\par \par \uc2 In part because of its complexity and relatively low transaction volumes, that corner of Wall Street has been one of the more resistant to technological changes sweeping trading, lending and just about everything else in banking. A recent study by the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2  estimated that only 40% of investment-grade corporate bond trading was executed through computers rather than over the phone, compared with 75% in Treasury-debt trading, 80% in stocks and 90% in a broad array of futures contracts.\par \par \uc2 The investment banks are targeting small trades, those under $1 million, that otherwise might fall through the cracks. It is yet another example of banks turning to technology to try to generate revenue growth at relatively low cost.\par \par \uc2 Starting with the smaller trades is a safer route for the banks because it doesn't threaten the profit margins on the big trades they do with institutions.\par \par \uc2 While the banks are taking it slow, the smaller trades eventually may be a precursor to fully automating some bigger trades, which are often trickier to execute and require more human hand-holding.\par \par \uc2 "Banks see an opportunity to take advantage of trading opportunities they were missing in the past," said \uc2 Richard Schiffman\uc2 , head of open trading at \uc2 MarketAxess Holdings Inc\uc2 ., operator of an electronic bond-trading network.\par \par \uc2 Some past efforts to change the patterns of bond trading have met resistance or petered out. Platforms offered several years ago by Wall Street firms including Goldman and money manager BlackRock Inc. were shelved or integrated into other efforts.\par \par \uc2 But more recent initiatives, such as networks connecting bond investors to trade with each other, have started to show traction.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  launched its system, called CSLiveEx, this year, making the decision to fully automate the smallest trades in the U.S. market for bonds of corporations with top credit. That means the trades have no direct human involvement.\par \par \uc2 In corporate bonds, traders working the phone still dominate the market, in part because there are so many various bonds to follow, all with different permutations such as maturity and yield. Some corporate bonds also don't trade that often after their initial sale, even for major companies like \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . In that type of market, salespeople who can influence buyers and sellers still add value.\par \par \uc2 "We are running with the machines, rather than letting them do the running on their own," said Samik Chandarana, a veteran credit trader who was recently named head of \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data science at \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 .'s investment bank. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  and its peers, which tend to have bigger trading desks, have invested in technology as well, primarily to aid human traders.\par \par \uc2 While automated service is more prevalent in trading for retail bond investors, and has been technically feasible for several years, it is rarely used to respond to electronic trade requests from institutions such as pensions and hedge funds.\par \par \uc2 But the increasing amounts and sophistication of data is starting to change that. And banks are eager to make money out of the thousands of small electronic trade requests they get daily.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  says its new technology will help the firm serve more clients without adding extra traders or bond inventory. CSLiveEx is "designed to have as many customers as possible, without using a lot of balance sheet," said Julian Pomfret-Pudelsky, a fixed-income algorithmic trader at Credit Suisse who began working on the project in early 2016.\par \par \uc2 Goldman in 2015 began making a limited number of trades under $1 million via software called \uc2 GS\uc2  Algo and has this year expanded that to some 7,500 different individual bonds.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  has also recently begun fully automated trading for smaller investment-grade corporate bonds, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich506\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3930\pichgoal7590

Following U.S. regulators' move to release \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 . from federal oversight, \uc2 Prudential Financial Inc\uc2 . is now the sole nonbank firm wearing the tag "systemically important financial institution."\par \par \uc2 Prudential's planned path to de-designation is less obvious than those of its rivals, but regulators' reasoning on AIG gives the company hope.\par \par \uc2 As recently as the beginning of 2016, there were four nonbank financial firms designated as SIFIs: AIG, Prudential, \uc2 MetLife Inc\uc2 . and General Electric Co.'s GE Capital.\par \par \uc2 A federal court {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judge-rescinds-federal-government-determination-that-metlife-is-systemically-important-1459349828"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rescinded MetLife's designation}}}\uc2  in March 2016, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-pulls-overseers-from-metlife-in-wake-of-ruling-1459466554"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 federal supervisors left the firm's offices the next day}}}\uc2 . The \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2 , the regulatory group empowered under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to make SIFI designations, is appealing that ruling.\par \par \uc2 The oversight council de-designated \uc2 GE Capital\uc2  in mid-2016 and lifted AIG's label last month, finding the companies no longer pose a threat to financial stability.\par \par \uc2 Both AIG and \uc2 GE Capital\uc2  pointed to significant changes at the companies since they initially received the "SIFI" tag: They had shrunk or pulled back from businesses that had previously worried regulators.\par \par \uc2 Prudential is a big insurance company like AIG, but it has a different story to tell. The company hasn't overhauled itself since becoming a SIFI in 2013, instead taking the view that it could handle the additional regulation.\par \par \uc2 So Prudential plans to make a different case, according to people familiar with its thinking. It will reprise previous arguments that it never posed a threat to financial stability in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Those arguments didn't carry the day back in 2013, but the oversight council looks much different now, with Trump-appointed regulators mostly in charge. In de-designating AIG, the council not only cited the company's shrinkage but changes in regulators' views.\par \par \uc2 The oversight council {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://bit.ly/2glnTkp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 said it had conducted "additional analyses" of AIG}}}\uc2 , such as "the effects of incentives and disincentives for policyholders to surrender their life insurance policies and annuities." Those analyses indicated that, contrary to regulators' worries under the Obama administration, "there is not a significant risk that a forced asset liquidation by AIG would disrupt market functioning and thereby pose a threat to U.S. financial stability."\par \par \uc2 Presumably the FSOC's new approach to analyzing financial-stability risks will be applicable to Prudential as well.\par \par \uc2 The AIG move shows the new regime is skeptical of the utility of SIFI designations, so Prudential should have a sympathetic ear. Now it is time for the company to build its case, and for the FSOC to listen.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 SEC Names J.P. Morgan Executive as Top Regulator of Exchanges\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  on Wednesday tapped \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 .'s top electronic-trading executive as a senior regulator, signaling an appetite for shaking up rules that are blamed for fragmenting trading across dozens of venues and fomenting the rise of high-frequency trading.\par \par \uc2 Brett Redfearn will become the SEC's director of trading and markets, making him the agency's point person for regulating exchanges, broker-dealers and high-speed trading firms. As \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 's global head of market structure, Mr. Redfearn has criticized some exchanges' business models and privileges, including the legal immunity they enjoy from many lawsuits.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Redfearn has particularly needled exchanges over their practice of packaging and selling expensive market-data feeds. The real-time price reels play a part in high-speed traders' secret sauce, and many Wall Street banks also buy them to stay competitive.\par \par \uc2 "I am particularly interested in market data and market access, and ensuring we have a very fair and competitive landscape," Mr. Redfearn said in an interview Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Redfearn, 53 years old, went to Evergreen State College in Washington state and holds a master's degree in political science from the New School in New York City. He started his career not on Wall Street but as an economic development official at the \uc2 Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\uc2 . He joined the \uc2 American Stock Exchange\uc2  in 1996 and in 2004 moved to \uc2 Bear Stearns Cos\uc2 ., which was acquired by \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  during the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  executive said he would join the SEC soon without giving a date. He is one of the final top hires of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump administration appointee who took over the regulator in May.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Redfearn is part of a wave of Wall Street veterans who have joined Mr. Clayton's staff, a practice known as the "revolving door" that accelerated after the agency courted industry experts after the 2008 crisis. Mr. Clayton earlier hired \uc2 Alan Cohen\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 . 's former global head of compliance, and David Metzman, former chief compliance officer of hedge-fund manager Aurelius Capital Management LP.\par \par \uc2 Other high-ranking regulators, including Mr. Redfearn's predecessor as director of trading and markets, have left the SEC to join Wall Street firms such as trading behemoth Citadel Securities.\par \par \uc2 "Brett's extensive markets experience and his longstanding, active engagement with investors, financial services firms, exchanges, and the SEC make him exceptionally well-positioned to lead the Division of Trading and Markets," Mr. Clayton said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Part of Mr. Redfearn's role at \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  involved helping long-term investors such as mutual-fund managers navigate the Byzantine structure of the stock market. He has been an outspoken critic of the regulatory privileges\u8212\'20\'14such as legal immunity\u8212\'20\'14that stock exchanges maintain despite their move a decade ago to become for-profit companies.\par \par \uc2 The feud stems from federal judicial decisions that found exchanges enjoy limited liability for decisions they make as operators and regulators of markets. The dispute exploded into the mainstream in 2012 when brokers complained \uc2 Nasdaq Inc\uc2 . didn't adequately compensate them for losses stemming from the exchange's botched initial public offering of \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Exchanges' immunity and limitations on liability provide exchanges with an unfair advantage in areas where they are competing with broker-dealers, alternative trading systems, and vendors," Mr. Redfearn wrote in testimony prepared for an SEC advisory committee hearing in April.\par \par \uc2 His most immediate assignment will be shepherding the SEC's move to revamp incentives that exchanges offer to attract trading. Many large investors believe the incentives\u8212\'20\'14rebates of trading fees handed back to brokers\u8212\'20\'14skew where their orders are routed. The SEC is preparing to propose a pilot program that would reduce the rebates on a sample of stocks to see if market quality improves.\par \par \uc2 A bigger challenge awaits after that. Mr. Clayton has shown an interest in reconsidering a package of SEC rules passed in 2005, known as Regulation NMS, which helped disperse stock trading across more than 50 platforms, including exchanges and private venues known as dark pools. The fragmentation has caused complexity that critics say has increased breakdowns and malfunctions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Redfearn declined to say whether he would support rule changes that could rein in the proliferation of U.S. equity exchanges, now numbering more than a dozen. "Anytime somebody talks about fragmentation, you are also talking about competition," he said. "We are in a very pro-competition environment."\par \par \uc2 "It's going to be important to go back and discuss these issues with the chairman, the other commissioners and the staff, and see how we can work together to arrive at some more efficient outcomes," he added.\par \par \uc2 Some Republican critics of the rules, including former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, argue the rules also stripped brokers of discretion for how to best fill clients' orders. Mr. Redfearn declined to say how he might approach an overhaul of the rules, but signaled the time is right for an in-depth review.\par \par \uc2 "It's been 10 years since the implementation of Regulation NMS and certainly it's time to revisit that set of rules," he said. "The SEC is more in control of its agenda and it's a good place to focus on some of these important issues."\par \par \uc2 Tezos Raised $232 Million in a Hot Coin Offering, Then a Fight Broke Out\par \par \uc2 By Paul Vigna\par \par \uc2 One of the year's biggest initial coin offerings, a $232 million token sale by Tezos, is embroiled in a management fight that is threatening the deal and highlighting the risks in this red-hot corner of finance.\par \par \uc2 Tezos's fundraising in July at that point was the largest initial coin offering, a new type of rapid fundraising that has captured imaginations and rivaled venture capital for technology startups.\par \par \uc2 But a battle between the founders of the company and the head of the Swiss foundation they installed to give it more independence has put most trading of Tezos coins on ice, possibly until early next year.\par \par \uc2 That could alarm investors who were hoping that Tezos might catch on quickly. Sales of digital tokens like Tezos coins have concerned regulators and become a sign for some investors of a bubble in the cryptocurrency world.\par \par \uc2 The costly battle at the company will be an early test for the coin market, which has raised $2.3 billion this year, about seven times the amount raised in all years before 2017.\par \par \uc2 The money has poured in due to enthusiasm for virtual currencies such as bitcoin and open-ledger "blockchain" technologies that are often tied to the offerings. The largely unregulated coin offerings in turn have helped push the value of bitcoin and some other virtual currencies to record highs.\par \par \uc2 But the Tezos deal highlights some of the drawbacks of initial coin offerings, also known as ICO 's : untested management, opaque structures and little transparency into what anyone involved wants to do with the huge sums they are raising.\par \par \uc2 The fight at Tezos is between the husband-and-wife team that started the deal and the founder of the nonprofit foundation they tapped to control the project.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lot to regret here," says Kathleen Breitman in an interview this week. She and her husband, Arthur, run the primary company developing Tezos, which wants to improve blockchain ledger technology through software. "We made a lot of mistakes. The best I can do is put my head down and work on the code."\par \par \uc2 A lawyer representing the Breitmans on Sunday sent a nine-page letter to the foundation's board, demanding that its founder and president, Johann Gervers be removed, or they would withdraw their support from the project.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gevers, in an email, wrote that "the Breitmans have attempted to bypass the Swiss legal structure and take over control of the foundation, and have acted destructively, causing months of delays in the Tezos project."\par \par \uc2 He has alleged the Breitmans' involvement in his work "was incompatible with the needed independence of the foundation," according to a separate letter from a Breitman lawyer, which referenced a Sept. 21 meeting at which Mr. Gevers made the claim.\par \par \uc2 The Breitmans, in their late 20s at the time of the offering, had done stints at major firms. He had worked at \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2  . and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  , while she had spent time at hedge-fund manager Bridgewater Associates and consulting firm \uc2 Accenture\uc2  . Ms. Breitman also worked as a fellow on The Wall Street Journal's editorial page during the summer of 2011.\par \par \uc2 The couple now control Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc., which, according to Tezos' website, "owns all of the Tezos-related intellectual property." The Breitmans contends they used a Swiss foundation to boost the company's independence and add checks and balances in its early period. Eventually, the plan is for the Breitmans to sell their company to the foundation for about $20 million.\par \par \uc2 But how much control the Swiss foundation has over the company's direction has led to a dispute that has put trading of Tezos tokens held by investors in limbo while also putting some of the technology on hold as well.\par \par \uc2 The Tezos tokens, nicknamed tezzies, have yet to begin formally trading, though some trades are taking place in a less liquid prelaunch market. The formal start of trading is tied to the release of the production version of the Tezos platform. That has been delayed by the fight and may not come until February, more than six months after the money was raised last July, Ms. Breitman said.\par \par \uc2 The money that was raised in the deal is currently with the foundation in a bank account, Ms. Breitman says. The proceeds are in the process of being converted from virtual currencies\u8212\'20\'14bitcoin and ethereum\u8212\'20\'14into government-backed currencies.\par \par \uc2 The offerings are in many ways more akin to crowdfunding efforts than securities offerings, although the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  has said it would review exactly what an offering is on an individual basis. The coins sold by companies in most cases aren't equity in a firm. Rather, they are tokens that can be used at a future date to purchase services or products a company intends to produce.\par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 An earlier version of a photo caption that accompanied this article incorrectly referred to the tokens pictured as bitcoin and litecoin. The tokens pictured are bitcoin and ethereum. (Oct. 18, 2017)\par \par \uc2 Beneath the Market Rally: A Lot Less Trading\par \par \uc2 By \uc2 Riva Gold\par \par \uc2 Stocks continue to hit record highs, yet those pushing them there are trading less and less.\par \par \uc2 The number of stocks and exchange-traded products changing hands in the U.S. and Europe has fallen steadily in recent months as ultralow volatility, a lack of market-moving news and the rising popularity of passive investment funds have kept many investors on the sidelines.\par \par \uc2 Some investors are mulling what the drop-off says about a global equity rally that has lifted many markets, including in the U.S., to new highs. The muted trading could signal that investors are holding back amid skepticism that stocks have further to climb\u8212\'20\'14or that they are so confident they feel no need to sell.\par \par \uc2 Either way, the decline in equity volumes is another piece of bad news for banks, already beset by a steep falloff in fixed-income trading revenues.\par \par \uc2 This month, the average daily trading volume across the NYSE, \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  , NYSE American and NYSE Arca has fallen roughly 12% relative to this year's average and is down by around 22% from the average in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Trading in exchange-traded funds has also dropped off, with average daily volume for U.S. ETFs down 8.5% from a year ago, according to research and advisory firm XTF. Trading volume on the MSCI Europe index\u8212\'20\'14which tracks companies across 15 developed countries in Europe\u8212\'20\'14has fallen to its lowest in five years, according to \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ed Campbell, a portfolio manager at QMA, a multi-asset business of PGIM, said he spent most of the summer holding a bit more cash, ready to buy stocks on an anticipated dip in the market that never materialized.\par \par \uc2 "Things looked overextended and due for a pause\u8230\'20\'26but summer came and went and that never really happened," he said. In September, QMA decided to give in to the onslaught of upbeat economic data and slowly add more positions in banks and small-cap stocks instead of embarking on a bigger buying spree.\par \par \uc2 The collapse in trading volumes is closely tied to the recent fall in volatility, where measures of daily stock price movements have plumbed multiyear lows. When markets aren't moving, there are typically fewer people scrambling to protect their portfolios against further losses or seizing an opportunity to buy things that look cheap.\par \par \uc2 The S&P 500 hasn't experienced a daily drop of 1% or more in two months, while the CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, earlier this month fell to its lowest reading in over 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Volatility is so low now that, this October, the S&P 500 is on pace for its tightest monthly trading range since January 2007, when the index stayed within a range of 37.64 points, according to FactSet data.\par \par \uc2 "Volumes and volatility go hand and glove," said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. With U.S. indexes rising modestly for eight consecutive quarters, "there's no need to make radical adjustments in your portfolio, so as a result you're just sort of riding on what you have," he said.\par \par \uc2 The sort of major events that tend to drive big trading volumes, including elections, government policy changes and central bank shifts, have been few and far between this year. There have been elections in Europe, but the results of those have largely eased fears of political instability in the region. Meanwhile, economic data across emerging and developed markets has been remarkably resilient, while investors say the Federal Reserve has telegraphed its intentions to markets fairly consistently.\par \par \uc2 "The major views in our equity portfolios haven't changed much because the macro-environment hasn't changed significantly," said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management.\par \par \uc2 The muted trading could also suggest a lack of investor confidence among those with cash to invest, as solid quarterly earnings and a growing economy are offset by rising valuations and fears the bull market can't last much longer. The S&P 500 is currently trading at 18 times forward earnings, compared to 16.9 at the start of the year.\par \par \uc2 Given the lack of optimism, "it's a rally that hasn't felt like a rally," said Antoine Lesne, head of SPDR ETF Strategy and research at State Street Global Advisors.\par \par \uc2 The rise of passive investing\u8212\'20\'14relative to money pouring into active managers and hedge funds\u8212\'20\'14may also be exacerbating the sedate trading.\par \par \uc2 "There's still a very strong trend of people doing indexing, and when you invest in index funds you don't need to trade as often because they're not as volatile," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\par \par \uc2 BlackRock Inc\uc2 . and Vanguard Group, which have the largest stable of ETFs by assets, now manage about $10.7 trillion combined.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, "Many people are already in the market, and if things they own are going up and making money, there's no reason to sell," Mr. Frederick said. "And if you were sitting on cash, coming in now is pretty late to the game."\par \par \uc2 The falloff in trading volume isn't good news for banks who generate fees when investors trade.\par \par \uc2 Last Thursday, \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 . reported a 4% fall in revenue from equity trading in the third quarter. \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 .'s equity-trading revenue fell 7% over that period, the company said Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 For many, though, the glacial activity in equity markets may still be an encouraging sign.\par \par \uc2 "We are seeing strong drivers for growth and that is driving investor confidence in Europe, and driving more into long-term positions rather than short-term trades," said Ankit Gheedia, equity strategist at \uc2 BNP Paribas\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: China to Allow Foreign Banks to Increase Holdings in Domestic Lenders\par \par \uc2 BEIJING\u8212\'20\'14China will give foreign banks more space in conducting business in China, including allowing them to increase stakeholdings in domestic banks, the nation's top banking regulator said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Guo Shuqing, the head of the \uc2 China Banking Regulatory Commission\uc2 , said on the sidelines of the Communist Party's congress that the shrinking market share of foreign lenders in China is a negative and the regulator will allow foreign banks to provide more financial services in the Chinese market.\par \par \uc2 He said the regulator will also allow more private investors into the state-dominated banking sector.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Guo also said the regulator will step up supervision over banks' bad debt disposals and rein in the increase of hidden debt held by Chinese lenders.\par \par \uc2 In the first three quarters, Chinese banks have shed a total of 979.9 billion yuan ($147.9 billion) in bad loans off their books, said Mr. Guo.\par \par \uc2 According to the latest official data available, China's bad loan ratio declined to 1.73% at the end of second quarter, compared with 1.74% at the beginning of the year.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Yang Jie\par \par \uc2 Machines Took Over the Stock Market. Next Up, Bonds\par \par \uc2 By Telis Demos\par \par \uc2 Will machines take over the bond market too?\par \par \uc2 Banks including \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG\uc2  CS -0.69% , \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 GS\uc2  2.52% and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  MS 2.10% are all making bets in that direction, unleashing new trading software systems in recent months to pick up share in the $6 trillion market for investment-grade corporate debt.\par \par \uc2 In part because of its complexity and relatively low liquidity, that corner of Wall Street has been one of the more resistant to technological changes sweeping trading, lending and just about everything else in banking. A recent study by the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2  estimated that only 40% of investment-grade corporate bond trading was executed through computers rather than over the phone, compared with 75% in Treasury-debt trading, 80% in stocks and 90% in a broad array of futures contracts.\par \par \uc2 Now, investment banks are pushing to stoke more electronic trading in the market, especially with small trades that otherwise might fall through the cracks. It is yet another example of banks turning to technology to try to generate revenue growth at relatively low cost.\par \par \uc2 Starting with smaller trades, those under $1 million, is a safer route for the banks because it doesn't threaten the profit margins on the big trades they do with institutions.\par \par \uc2 While the banks are taking it slow, the smaller trades eventually may be a precursor to fully automating some bigger trades, which are often trickier to execute and require more human hand holding.\par \par \uc2 "Banks see an opportunity to take advantage of trading opportunities they were missing in the past," said \uc2 Richard Schiffman\uc2 , head of open trading at \uc2 MarketAxess Holdings Inc\uc2 ., operator of an electronic bond-trading network.\par \par \uc2 Some past efforts to change the patterns of bond trading have met resistance or petered out. Platforms offered several years ago by Wall Street players including Goldman and money manager BlackRock Inc. were shelved or integrated into other efforts.\par \par \uc2 But more recent initiatives, such as networks connecting bond investors to trade with each other, have started to show traction.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  launched its system, called CSLiveEx, earlier this year, making the decision to fully automate the smallest trades in the U.S. market for bonds of corporations with top credit. That means the trades have no direct human involvement.\par \par \uc2 In corporate bonds, traders working the phone still dominate the market, in part because there are so many various bonds to follow, all with different permutations such as maturity and yield. Some corporate bonds also don't trade that often after their initial sale, even for major companies like \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . In that type of market, human salespeople who can wheedle buyers and sellers still add value.\par \par \uc2 "We are running with the machines, rather than letting them do the running on their own," said Samik Chandarana, a veteran credit trader who was recently named head of \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data science at J.P. Morgan Chase JPM 0.38% & Co.'s investment bank. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  and its peers, which tend to have bigger balance sheets and trading desks, have invested in technology as well, primarily to aid human traders.\par \par \uc2 While automated service is more prevalent in trading for retail bond investors, and has been technically feasible for several years, it is rarely used to respond to electronic trade requests from institutions such as pensions and hedge funds.\par \par \uc2 But the increasing amounts and sophistication of data is starting to change that. And banks are eager to make money out of the thousands of small electronic trade requests they get daily.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  says its new technology will help the firm serve more clients without adding extra traders or bond inventory. CSLiveEx is "designed to have as many customers as possible, without using a lot of balance sheet," said Julian Pomfret-Pudelsky, a fixed-income algorithmic trader at Credit Suisse who began working on the project in early 2016.\par \par \uc2 Before launching CSLiveEx, \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  responded to fewer than 10% of clients' electronic trade requests for the smallest investment-grade corporate bond trades. Now the bank says it is responding to virtually all of those inquiries and executing trades twice as often as it did before.\par \par \uc2 Goldman in 2015 began making a limited number of trades under $1 million via software called \uc2 GS\uc2  Algo, and has this year expanded that to some 7,500 different individual bonds. The securities firm says the move has dramatically improved the rate at which it responded to client electronic trade requests.\par \par \uc2 "A natural place to start in the automation process is where it would enhance our ability to service our clients' liquidity needs," said Amy Hong, head of market structure strategy for global credit at Goldman. The bank has said its recently slumping fixed-income division is focusing on expanding its client roster and improving relationships.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  has also recently begun fully automated trading for smaller investment-grade corporate bonds, as a way to handle some of the 10,000-plus electronic trade requests it gets a day for such trades, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 If algorithms can handle the smaller trades, some believe banks may eventually unleash them on larger ones. Investors may also decide to break up their big orders into smaller pieces, as is common in the stock market.\par \par \uc2 "Banks are giving the algorithms a lot of at-bats," said Michael Sobel, president of TruMid Financial LLC, an electronic bond trading network. "I fully expect that the folks who are successful will keep dialing up the sizes."\par \par \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  Faces Reckoning Over Africa Bets\par \par \uc2 By Robb M. Stewart in Melbourne and Dave Michaels in Washington\par \par \uc2 A U.S. lawsuit alleging \uc2 Rio Tinto PLC\uc2  misled investors about the value of its assets in Mozambique is the second serious regulatory problem in less than a year to rock the mining giant over its forays in Africa.\par \par \uc2 The world's second-largest independent mining company was already grappling with multiple investigations in the U.S., U.K. and Australia into a $10.5 million payment made to a consultant to help it acquire rights to a large iron-ore deposit in Guinea known as Simandou. That revelation forced the departure last November of \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2 's energy and minerals chief and a legal and regulatory affairs executive.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, allegations that the British-Australian company misled investors over its Mozambique coal assets forced its former chief financial officer, \uc2 Guy Elliott\uc2 , to resign from the board of \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell PLC\uc2 . The \uc2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  is seeking to bar Mr. Elliott and former Rio Tinto Chief Executive Thomas Albanese from serving as officers or directors of a public company.\par \par \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  continued to value the mining assets in Mozambique at more than $3 billion despite an internal assessment that they were worth negative $680 million, according to a SEC lawsuit filed this week in Manhattan federal court.\par \par \uc2 The SEC is pursuing civil financial penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains through its lawsuit. Separately, \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  agreed to pay \u163\'00\'A327 million ($36 million) to settle claims by the \uc2 U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  that the company didn't write down the value of the Mozambique mine in a timely manner.\par \par \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  said Tuesday that the SEC's claims of fraud are "unwarranted" and would be proven wrong in court. Mr. Albanese said he is innocent of any wrongdoing and that the SEC's claims "will be proved baseless." A spokeswoman for Mr. Elliott said he also disputes the SEC's charges and will fight them.\par \par \uc2 Shell said Wednesday that Mr. Elliott stood down over "his involvement in legal proceedings regarding his former employment at \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2 " and that he would like to be considered for rejoining its board once the issue was resolved.\par \par \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2 's shares were down about 1.2% in afternoon trading in London. Tyler Broda, a mining analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the revelations were unlikely to significantly affect \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2 's share price.\par \par \uc2 "It will likely cause more noise around Rio's corporate culture, especially on the back of the Simandou bribery charges from last year," Mr. Broda said in a note. \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  says it is cooperating with all probes into the Simandou case.\par \par \uc2 The Mozambique and Guinea cases ramp up scrutiny of \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2 's actions under Mr. Albanese, who resigned in 2013 after the company announced it was writing down the value of assets around the world by $14 billion, including $3 billion in Mozambique, as commodity prices began to fall.\par \par \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  sold the Mozambique coal business in 2014 for $50 million, or about 2% of what it paid, the SEC said.\par \par \uc2 The $14 billion figure included a huge impairment on the value of \uc2 Alcan Inc\uc2 ., an aluminum processing company that \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  acquired in 2007.\par \par \uc2 The SEC alleged that Messrs. Albanese and Elliott didn't disclose the problems with the Mozambique assets because they had already written down the value of \uc2 Alcan\uc2  and feared the market's reaction to another unsuccessful deal.\par \par \uc2 The project hit several major setbacks, including the Mozambique government's rejection of transport plans for the coal. The company knew by the end of 2011 that it could sell only about 5% of the coal that it had originally assumed, the SEC alleged.\par \par \uc2 The company later raised $3 billion through debt sold to investors without revealing the problems with the Mozambique assets, the SEC said.\par \par \uc2 In Guinea, internal emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal showed that high-level executives including Mr. Albanese approved the payment in 2011 to a consultant who was close to senior Guinean government officials.\par \par \uc2 The emails, which were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, show Rio executive \uc2 Alan Davies\uc2  asking permission from the company's then-iron-ore chief, \uc2 Sam Walsh\uc2 , to make the payments to Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois de Combret, a former Lazard Ltd. managing director.\par \par \uc2 Mr. de Combret had been helping the company negotiate with the Guinean government to retain an iron-ore concession in the country's Simandou mountain range, according to Mr. Davies's email, and his services "were of the most unique nature," including helping the company's communications with Guinea's president, Alpha Cond\u233\'00\'E9. Mr. Cond\u233\'00\'E9 was at the time being advised by Mr. de Combret, a friend he had met in school in Paris, according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Walsh, who was \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2 's iron ore chief at the time, checked the idea with Mr. Albanese, the company's then-chief executive, who gave the green light but warned Mr. Walsh to "think of the optics to the [government of Guinea.]," according to the emails. Mr. Walsh later served as CEO from 2013 to 2016.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Davies has denied wrongdoing. This year he was named CEO of Moxico Resources PLC, a copper mining company with assets in Zambia. A Moxico representative didn't immediately respond do a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Attempts to reach Messrs.

Among them: replacing the chairmen of its audit and technology committees, tougher policies for the "clawback" of executive pay and a commitment that future breaches get escalated to the board level.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  directors "did not anticipate a core concern to the company's operations,'' wrote Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW, the investment arm of the union coalition \uc2 Change to Win\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 An Equifax spokeswoman said the company would review the letter. She said no decision had been made by the board about permanently separating the roles of chairman and CEO, and the board is currently reviewing all committee assignments.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  disclosed last month that data belonging to about 145.5 million Americans was potentially compromised by hackers who began digging through its computer network this spring. The hack remained undetected until late July.

But the truth is that these warnings largely fell on deaf ears.\par \par \uc2 The problem is that European policy makers don't share London's sense of its own importance. They note that much of the European financial activity that takes place in London comprises European savings being made available to European companies via European banks staffed by European citizens.\par \par \uc2 The fact that this activity happens to be transacted in London has less to do with the genius of English law, or the superiority of its regulators or the quality of its restaurants, but because the EU single market passport allows any financial-services firm registered in one EU country to provide financial services in every other EU country.\par \par \uc2 Over time, this has certainly bought economic advantages to the EU as the depth of liquidity in London's markets and the cluster effect have reduced costs and boosted innovation\u8212\'20\'14though these need to be balanced against the costs in the form of increased exposure to cross-border risks that emerged during the global financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 But finance is a simple business that depends on having the necessary permission to provide your services\u8212\'20\'14and permission can always be withdrawn.\par \par \uc2 Would the sudden withdrawal of permission for U.K.-based firms to provide cross-border services to the EU lead to financial chaos in Europe, as British officials claim?\par \par \uc2 European policy makers are contemptuous of this argument. Speaking at a conference organized by the International Institute for Finance on Saturday, senior Bundesbank official Andreas Dombret noted that banks have been preparing for Brexit for a year and have more than 18 more months to implement their contingency plans.\par \par \uc2 Speaking on the same panel, senior \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group\uc2  executive Faryar Shirzad made clear that his bank\u8212\'20\'14like others\u8212\'20\'14is preparing its plans on the basis of the most conservative assumptions, which include the possibility of the U.K. leaving the EU without a trade deal.\par \par \uc2 British lobbyists warn that the real stability risk concerns trillions of euros of cross-border derivative contracts that may need to be rewritten if permissions are withdrawn. Yet that assumes that EU policy makers would be reckless enough to put financial stability at risk rather than legislate for the grandfathering of contracts while necessary legal adjustments are made.\par \par \uc2 The bigger question is whether the EU could ever agree to the U.K.'s central demand for a comprehensive free-trade agreement that preserves London's status as Europe's financial center.\par \par \uc2 That seems unlikely. For EU officials, it comes down to a question of risk: how much risk\u8212\'20\'14financial and political\u8212\'20\'14is one willing to import into one's financial system to secure the benefits of cross-border trade?\par \par \uc2 The answer will hinge on an assessment not only of the quality of the regulatory framework and the enforcement mechanisms but also the scale of activity: that's why the EU took three months to recognize Japanese derivative clearing as "equivalent" but four years to agree a similar deal with the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Yet the U.K.'s share of European derivative clearing is far higher than that of the U.S.\u8212\'20\'14and comes with added currency risk: only a fraction of euro-denominated trades are cleared in the U.S. compared with over 80% in the U.K. And since the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  would therefore have no choice but to provide liquidity if a U.K.-based clearinghouse failed, that makes the question of risk tolerance highly relevant.\par \par \uc2 The British response is to offer the EU some degree of shared oversight over London's financial markets. But how this would work in practice isn't clear, given the U.K.'s determination to set its own rules.\par \par \uc2 Nor is it clear why the EU would accept such a deal, which it would in any case come under pressure to offer to every other financial center in the world.\par \par \uc2 After all, if the lion's share of EU financial services are provided out of London, then EU supervisors will have little to supervise, putting them at a significant disadvantage to U.K. supervisors upon whom they would become even more reliant, turning the EU itself into a rule-taker.\par \par \uc2 "No jurisdiction could accept this," says one senior Brussels official, arguing that while the EU has to accept London as its financial hub in the near-term, it cannot do so on a 10- to 20-year view.\par \par \uc2 Won't treating the U.K. the same way that it treats other third countries\u8212\'20\'14such as the U.S. and Canada\u8212\'20\'14cost the EU? Sure. Any post-Brexit settlement that leads to increased fragmentation and reduced liquidity will push up the cost of financial services.\par \par \uc2 Would these costs prove an intolerable burden on the industry or EU economy? That seems highly unlikely. But would the disappearance of a sizable chunk of the \u8364\'20\'AC40 billion ($47 billion) of European financial-services revenues\u8212\'20\'14and the tax revenues that are attached to it\u8212\'20\'14be tolerable to the U.K.? That's another matter.\par \par \uc2 LSE Chief Rolet to Leave Next Year\par \par \uc2 By Ben Dummett\par \par \uc2 London Stock Exchange Group LSE -0.97% PLC on Thursday said Chief Executive Xavier Rolet would leave the company by the end of next year, bringing down the curtain on a tenure marked by a big bet on index services and a failed attempt to create a pan-European exchange.\par \par \uc2 The LSE said it would start looking for a new chief executive and work closely with Mr. Rolet\u8212\'20\'14who was appointed in May 2009\u8212\'20\'14to ensure a smooth handover.\par \par \uc2 Despite the lengthy transition, the LSE's new CEO will likely take the helm amid Britain's messy divorce from the rest of Europe and the uncertain economic and political climate that is creating. At the same time, the company's lucrative business clearing trades in derivatives and other securities faces new competition. Earlier this month, German clearinghouse Eurex, which is owned by \uc2 Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse AG\uc2  DBOEF -1.09% , announced plans to set up a profit-sharing system with customers to try to win market share from the LSE's majority-owned LCH Group Ltd.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Rolet is leaving the LSE in a position of strength, as one of the world's biggest providers of licensing indexes for institutional investors and developers of exchange-traded funds. This follows the 57-year-old's $2.7 billion acquisition of index-services provider \uc2 Frank Russell Co\uc2 . in 2014. The deal represented a successful bet on low-cost funds that mimic benchmarks from higher cost mutual funds.\par \par \uc2 Vanguard Group, a leading provider of index funds, attracted nearly $300 billion into its funds for the first nine months of this year, almost matching flows into the firm for all of 2016 and underscoring the demand for index products on which these types of funds are built.\par \par \uc2 The LSE's latest results highlight the benefits of Mr. Rolet's aggressive move into index services. The exchange operator Thursday reported an 18% jump in third-quarter revenue from the same period a year ago to \u163\'00\'A3442.7 million ($584.5 million), led by gains in its information-services division, which includes indexes, as well as by a strong performance from its clearing operations. The company said total income for the third quarter rose 17% to \u163\'00\'A3486.1 million.\par \par \uc2 Under Mr. Rolet's leadership the market capitalization of the LSE has risen from about \u163\'00\'A3800 million to almost \u163\'00\'A314 billion, the company said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Rolet's more ambitious plans to create a pan-European exchange, and before that a trans-Atlantic exchange operator, ultimately failed amid regulatory and political pressures.\par \par \uc2 After agreeing to a near $30 billion tie-up with Germany's Deutsche B\u246\'00\'F6rse, European regulators blocked the proposed deal in March after more than a yearlong effort to complete the transaction.\par \par \uc2 The exchanges hoped the combination would create a more formidable competitor against U.S. rivals such as \uc2 CME Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange Inc\uc2 ., while bringing greater financial stability to Europe's capital markets and offering companies and other market participants a deeper pool of funding.\par \par \uc2 But the EU worried the deal risked giving the combined entity too much influence over the clearing of fixed-income trading after the LSE refused to comply with certain conditions, including the sale of the LSE's Italian credit-trading platform.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, the LSE tried to create a trans-Atlantic exchange operator through a merger with Canada's main stock market operator but that succumbed to a rival homegrown bid that had the backing of some of Canada's biggest executives and politicians.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Maryam Cockar contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: CFTC's Lone Democrat to Lead Market Risk Advisory Committee\par \par \uc2 The newest member of the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 , Democrat Russ Behnam, will lead the agency's Market Risk Advisory Committee, he announces at a derivatives industry conference in Chicago.

Among the challenges on the horizon, the report notes, are the underfunding of Social Security, which is projected to be unable to pay full retirement benefits starting in 2035, and the shift from a defined benefit pension system to 401(k)-style plans, which puts the risks and responsibilities of funding retirement onto the individual. The GAO report recommends appointing representatives from government agencies, employers, the financial services industry, unions and academia.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 . said Wednesday that it reached an agreement with \uc2 United Airlines\uc2  to offer travel insurance to the airline's customers.\par \par \uc2 The arrangement in part reflects AIG Chief Executive \uc2 Brian Duperreault\uc2 's plan to put his stamp on the company with expansion through growth of existing businesses and acquisitions.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 AIG\uc2  is known as one of the world's biggest sellers of property-casualty insurance to businesses, Mr. Duperreault has identified the company's global Personal Insurance business as an area in which opportunities for growth exist, as well as its life-insurance and retirement-services business.\par \par \uc2 Under the multiyear deal, \uc2 AIG\uc2  will offer travel insurance to United's customers in the U.S. and 15 other countries.\par \par \uc2 The New York-based insurer has had arrangements with smaller airline carriers in the U.S. for years, and some big ones in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 Financial terms weren't disclosed.\par \par \uc2 From 2009 through 2012, \uc2 AIG\uc2  divested itself of tens of billions of dollars of businesses and assets to repay its nearly $185 billion bailout during the financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 More recently, it has been shrinking the business-insurance unit as a way to shed poorly performing accounts and improve margins.\par \par \uc2 Industrywide, insurers have been struggling for a few years to raise rates on many business-insurance product lines.\par \par \uc2 Analysts believe the recent spate of severe hurricanes will usher in rate increases for certain product lines, but few are predicting broad-based increases.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Rutledge, CEO at AIG Travel, said the United arrangement springs from technology investments that \uc2 AIG\uc2  made in recent years that would allow "the use of predictive \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to enable \uc2 AIG\uc2  to bring robust data insight directly to the traveler's insurance offer."\par \par \uc2 AIG\uc2  will provide coverage for trip cancellation, baggage loss and emergency medical services.\par \par \uc2 The company's travel insurance business dates from 1939, when a unit began offering simple automotive and personal-effects coverage for tourists and business travelers.\par \par \uc2 AIG\uc2 's Personal Insurance business includes auto, property and accident insurance. \uc2 AIG\uc2  also is one of the largest U.S. warranty providers for consumer electronics and appliances.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20171019000028"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020171019edaj0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Next Up, Bonds; Banks unleash new trading software systems in effort to pick up share of $6 trillion corporate-debt market\b0\par\par\uc2 By Telis Demos \par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 October 2017\par 16:04\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Will machines take over the bond market too?\par \par \uc2 Banks including \uc2 Credit Suisse Group AG\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  are all making bets in that direction, unleashing new trading software systems in recent months to pick up share in the $6 trillion market for investment-grade corporate debt.\par \par \uc2 In part because of its complexity and relatively low liquidity, that corner of Wall Street has been one of the more resistant to technological changes sweeping trading, lending and just about everything else in banking. A recent study by the \uc2 Bank for International Settlements\uc2  estimated that only 40% of investment-grade corporate bond trading was executed through computers rather than over the phone, compared with 75% in Treasury-debt trading, 80% in stocks and 90% in a broad array of futures contracts.\par \par \uc2 Now, investment banks are pushing to stoke more electronic trading in the market, especially with small trades that otherwise might fall through the cracks. It is yet another example of banks turning to technology to try to generate revenue growth at relatively low cost.\par \par \uc2 Starting with smaller trades, those under $1 million, is a safer route for the banks because it doesn't threaten the profit margins on the big trades they do with institutions.\par \par \uc2 While the banks are taking it slow, the smaller trades eventually may be a precursor to fully automating some bigger trades, which are often trickier to execute and require more human hand holding.\par \par \uc2 "Banks see an opportunity to take advantage of trading opportunities they were missing in the past," said \uc2 Richard Schiffman\uc2 , head of open trading at \uc2 MarketAxess Holdings Inc\uc2 ., operator of an electronic bond-trading network.\par \par \uc2 Some past efforts to change the patterns of bond trading have met resistance or petered out. Platforms offered several years ago by Wall Street players including Goldman and money manager BlackRock Inc. were shelved or integrated into other efforts.\par \par \uc2 But more recent initiatives, such as networks connecting {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-new-bond-market-bigger-is-better-1498046401"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bond investors to trade with each other }}}\uc2 , have started to show traction.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  launched its system, called CSLiveEx, earlier this year, making the decision to fully automate the smallest trades in the U.S. market for bonds of corporations with top credit. That means the trades have no direct human involvement.\par \par \uc2 In corporate bonds, traders working the phone still dominate the market, in part because there are so many various bonds to follow, all with different permutations such as maturity and yield. Some corporate bonds also don't trade that often after their initial sale, even for major companies like \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 . In that type of market, human salespeople who can wheedle buyers and sellers still add value.\par \par \uc2 "We are running with the machines, rather than letting them do the running on their own," said Samik Chandarana, a veteran credit trader who was recently named head of \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data science at \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 .'s investment bank. \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  and its peers, which tend to have bigger balance sheets and trading desks, have invested in technology as well, primarily to aid human traders.\par \par \uc2 While automated service is more prevalent in trading for retail bond investors, and has been technically feasible for several years, it is rarely used to respond to electronic trade requests from institutions such as pensions and hedge funds.\par \par \uc2 But the increasing amounts and sophistication of data is starting to change that. And banks are eager to make money out of the thousands of small electronic trade requests they get daily.\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  says its new technology will help the firm serve more clients without adding extra traders or bond inventory. CSLiveEx is "designed to have as many customers as possible, without using a lot of balance sheet," said Julian Pomfret-Pudelsky, a fixed-income algorithmic trader at Credit Suisse who began working on the project in early 2016.\par \par \uc2 Before launching CSLiveEx, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-ramps-up-restructuring-as-trading-revenue-slumps-1458716723"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Credit Suisse responded to fewer than 10% of clients' electronic trade requests }}}\uc2  for the smallest investment-grade corporate bond trades. Now the bank says it is responding to virtually all of those inquiries and executing trades twice as often as it did before.\par \par \uc2 Goldman in 2015 began making a limited number of trades under $1 million via software called \uc2 GS\uc2  Algo, and has this year expanded that to some 7,500 different individual bonds. The securities firm says the move has dramatically improved the rate at which it responded to client electronic trade requests.\par \par \uc2 "A natural place to start in the automation process is where it would enhance our ability to service our clients' liquidity needs," said Amy Hong, head of market structure strategy for global credit at Goldman. The bank has said its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldmans-new-obsession-adding-5-billion-in-revenue-1505226854"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recently slumping fixed-income division }}}\uc2  is focusing on expanding its client roster and improving relationships.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  has also recently begun fully automated trading for smaller investment-grade corporate bonds, as a way to handle some of the 10,000-plus electronic trade requests it gets a day for such trades, people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 If algorithms can handle the smaller trades, some believe banks may eventually unleash them on larger ones. Investors may also decide to break up their big orders into smaller pieces, as is common in the stock market.\par \par \uc2 "Banks are giving the algorithms a lot of at-bats," said Michael Sobel, president of TruMid Financial LLC, an electronic bond trading network. "I fully expect that the folks who are successful will keep dialing up the sizes."\par \par \uc2 Write to Telis Demos at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:telis.demos@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 telis.demos@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171018edai002jp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

For Japanese cryptocurrency start-ups, however, a framework put in place by the country's financial authorities has been a boon.\par \par \uc2 Rules announced this year by the Financial Services Agency allow people to pay for goods and services with bitcoin and require cryptocurrency exchanges or remittance operators to be licensed and subject to annual audits. These have given bitcoin official approval.\par \par \uc2 "The Japanese have felt that cryptocurrencies are a scary thing but trading volumes have increased as many now see it as trustworthy thanks to government approval," says Yusuke Otsuka, chief operating officer at Coincheck, a bitcoin exchange.\par \par \uc2 The FSA issued operating licences to 11 bitcoin exchanges late last month . Coincheck has applied for a licence and is hoping to receive approval next month, Mr Otsuka says.\par \par \uc2 The new digital currency rules come as other governments clamp down on cryptocurrencies. China, for instance, has banned companies from issuing their own virtual currencies and is cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges.\par \par \uc2 However, for Japan, cryptocurrencies sit within the realm of fintech. Thegovernment and banking leaders hope that this sector's businesses - ranging from \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -led investment advisory groups to cloud data storage - will free up cash sitting in bank deposits and reignite the economy.\par \par \uc2 There has been domestic hand-wringing over the investment going into fintech ventures in Japan compared with that in other developed countries. Japan's fintech sector, seen as a laggard, had investments of $65m in 2015. This compares with $12bn in the US, $974m in the UK and $69m in Singapore, according to consultants \uc2 Accenture\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "We're hoping that fintech will change economic and corporate activity," says Takuya Fukumoto, director of industrial finance in the economy, trade and industry ministry. The ministry set out the government's vision in August, calling for an increase in cashless consumer payments, digitising back-office functions and new technologies to enhance cash flow between companies.\par \par \uc2 Japanese banks, worried that fintech ventures will become mainstream players, are trying to gain exposure to new technologies by either creating a business or investing in a start-up.\par \par \uc2 Kazuhisa Shibayama, founder and chief executive of WealthNavi, a "robo-advisory" company that offers customers investment advice provided by AI, has been helped by the government's push for fintech businesses.\par \par \uc2 When he started his company two years ago, the financial technology sector was not as well known as today.\par \par \uc2 "I was only told by venture capital investors after I started that my company was part of the fintech sector and that it was what people described as 'robo-advisory'," says Mr Shibayama.\par \par \uc2 He points out that for many fintech entrepreneurs, technology is only a tool to offer users better services at a cheaper price.\par \par \uc2 Many feel that unlike Japan's manufacturing sector, where companies introduced the notion of kaizen , or continual improvement, financial services might have been left behind.\par \par \uc2 Anecdotally, Mr Shibayama says, the new enthusiasm for fintech among businesses and investors has led to more venture capital firms looking for investments.\par \par \uc2 However, fintech entrepreneurs and start-ups are scarce, he adds, with young people still choosing the traditional route of looking for jobs in established companies.\par \par \uc2 The fintech arena also struggles to attract many of Japan's IT engineers and programmers, who tend to enter the country's thriving gaming sector.\par \par \uc2 While some may end up in financial services, the cultural gap between the two industries can be hard to bridge.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171018edai00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

"I don't know if tech companies are going to get broken up, but I do know the tech backlash is going to be strong."\par \par \uc2 Driving these concerns are job losses and economic inequality resulting from advances in tech and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , mixed with tech giants' growing influence in Americans' lives and politics, the panelists said.\par \par \uc2 "These companies are more powerful than \uc2 AT&T\uc2  ever was," said Bill Maris, a venture capitalist who ran the venture-capital arm of Google-parent Alphabet Inc. until earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 "If you think the system is broken," Mr. Maris added, "the people with power and money are the ones that people will look to say, \u8216\'20\'18We need to disrupt that.' "\par \par \uc2 Beyond political concerns, the investors\u8212\'20\'14who also included \uc2 Jenny Lee\uc2 , managing partner of the Chinese venture-capital firm \uc2 GGV Capital\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14voiced concerns about the health of many large well-funded startups that are valued at over $1 billion.\par \par \uc2 In the U.S. there are well over 100 such companies, which are often referred to as "unicorns"; many of them raised money at high valuations based on plans for growth that hasn't materialized as hoped.\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18We'll see more of the unicorns die" in the coming year, Ms. Lee said.\par \par \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 's Mr. Altman had a more-measured view of unicorns. He said most are overvalued, but that is normal in the startup world. He said generally that investor returns will "compress" as capital has flooded into the tech sector.\par \par \uc2 At the moment, the biggest single source of capital in Silicon Valley is \uc2 SoftBank Group Corp\uc2 ., the Japanese conglomerate that recently raised a $93 billion tech-focused fund.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Altman said that means the fund needs to be spending $10 billion to $20 billion a year in the tech sector\u8212\'20\'14a major challenge.\par \par \uc2 "There aren't that many opportunities for that," he said.\par \par \uc2 The result, he said, will likely be that the fund takes the place of an initial public stock offering for many companies, putting money into private late-stage tech companies so they can delay going public.\par \par \uc2 "It will take opportunities away from public markets," he said. "That's really bad."\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171019edai00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

The Dow industrials had never reached more than two such round-number marks in a year before 2017. Despite concerns that stocks are pricey and U.S. economic growth remains tepid, the blue-chip index is up 17% this year and has set 51 closing records.\par \par \uc2 Robust corporate earnings in the U.S. and abroad have supported a bull market now in its ninth year. With all 45 economies tracked by the \uc2 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\uc2  on track to grow this year {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-economies-grow-in-sync-1503507503"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 for the first time in a decade}}}\uc2 , many analysts and investors say conditions are favorable for stocks to continue to rise.\par \par \uc2 "We finally have everything clicking at once," said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. "What we've seen this year is really a global resurgence," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Dow industrials rose 160.16 points, or 0.7%, to 23157.60 in its largest one-day advance in five weeks. The index closed about three points shy of 23000 on Tuesday after {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-equities-rally-shows-signs-of-slowing-1508207161"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 briefly climbing above that level}}}\uc2  during the day.\par \par \uc2 IBM\uc2 's stock had its best day since 2009 on Wednesday, helping propel the Dow decisively over its latest milestone. The company's shares rose $12.99, or 8.9%, to $159.53 after the company on Tuesday {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-has-another-revenue-drop-during-its-transition-1508273024"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 exceeded Wall Street's profit and sales expectations}}}\uc2  in the most recent quarter.

Both indexes also closed at fresh records.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's session was relatively quiet, with fewer shares traded than this year's daily average. About 5.5 billion shares changed hands across exchanges owned by the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2  and the \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The financial sector was among the best performers, buoyed by big banks that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wsj.com/graphics/bank-earnings/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recently reported strong earnings}}}\uc2  despite a slowdown in trading revenue. Investors' response to bank earnings has been mixed.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  shares rose 1.03, or 2.1%, to 50.15 and \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group\uc2  advanced 5.94, or 2.5%, to 242.03\u8212\'20\'14adding 41 points to the Dow\u8212\'20\'14after Goldman shares fell following its earnings report the previous day.\par \par \uc2 Northern Trust\uc2  was among the S&P 500's biggest gainers. Its shares rose 3.48, or 3.8%, to 94.58 after the firm reported quarterly sales and profit figures that topped analysts' projections.\par \par \uc2 Third-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a strong start, investors say. Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported their earnings so far, more than 80% have beat analysts' expectations, compared with the five-year average of 69%, according to FactSet.\par \par \uc2 Expectations for U.S. tax cuts have also delivered a boost to Wall Street in recent sessions, some analysts say.\par \par \uc2 Vincent Deluard, head of global macro strategy at \uc2 INTL FCStone\uc2 , said he recommended buying small-cap value stocks in late August. Smaller firms that generate more revenue domestically stand to benefit from tax cuts and won't be affected as much if interest rates rise, he said, though he acknowledged that Republicans {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-unveil-plan-to-overhaul-u-s-tax-code-1506522802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 could face obstacles passing a }}}{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-unveil-plan-to-overhaul-u-s-tax-code-1506522802"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tax bill}}}\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 "I still think they're going to get something done," Mr. Deluard said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Amrith Ramkumar at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and \uc2 Riva Gold\uc2  at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:riva.gold@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 riva.gold@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171018edai000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LAGUNA BEACH, Calif.\u8212\'20\'14Two prominent executives in the cybersecurity industry on Tuesday debated whether the field is a long-term business\u8212\'20\'14or instead will be blended into the array of services tech giants offer customers.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's WSJ D.Live technology conference, Cloudflare Inc. Chief Executive \uc2 Matthew Prince\uc2  said major tech companies like \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  have the scale and resources to make cybersecurity an ordinary feature of their cloud-computing platforms and other services. Much like email-spam protection is part of Gmail, he said, cybersecurity likely will come "built into more and more platforms over time."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Prince hopes Cloudflare\u8212\'20\'14which supports and protects websites, handling nearly 10% of all internet requests\u8212\'20\'14will be one of those platforms, but "I don't think there will be many, if any, standalone security companies that exist."\par \par \uc2 George Kurtz, CEO of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Inc., shot back that hackers evolve quickly and are always trying new methods, a reality that requires the deep expertise of dedicated security firms, he said. "Security is such a specialized sport," he said at the conference. Platforms like \uc2 Google\uc2  and Amazon "can't make the very deep, focused investments that security companies can."\par \par \uc2 Cybersecurity breaches have been a major issue this year, from the WannaCry ransomware {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wannacry-malware-has-strong-links-to-group-tied-to-north-korea-symantec-says-1495519053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 that infected more than 200,000 computers }}}\uc2  in more than 100 countries to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weve-been-breached-inside-the-equifax-hack-1505693318"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 massive hack }}}\uc2  at credit-reporting firm \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . that compromised the personal data of potentially 145.5 million Americans. This month, \uc2 Verizon Communications Inc\uc2 . said that a 2013 hack of \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 , which it acquired this year, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-triples-estimate-of-breached-accounts-to-3-billion-1507062804"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 was far more extensive }}}\uc2  than previously disclosed, affecting all of \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 's 3 billion accounts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kurtz said companies like \uc2 CrowdStrike\uc2  are needed to protect against such breaches because of their specialized knowledge of hackers' methods.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Prince said cybersecurity is becoming easier because of the massive data tech giants are amassing, which enables them to more easily track patterns of behavior and spot anomalies that could be hacking attempts. "Security is really a \b \highlight22\uc2 big-data\b0 \highlight\uc2  problem," he said.\par \par \uc2 Cloudflare was drawn into a controversy over censorship on the internet in August when it pulled {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/was-i-right-to-pull-the-plug-on-a-nazi-website-1503440771"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 support for neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer }}}\uc2 , a move Mr. Prince later worried would set precedent for the company to weigh in on other controversial sites it supported.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Mr. Prince said Cloudflare was consulting with government officials, think tanks and others on developing a more firm policy to handle such sites, which he said Cloudflare would announce when it is ready.\par \par \uc2 Write to Jack Nicas at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jack.nicas@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jack.nicas@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171017edah0083r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

For Japanese cryptocurrency start-ups, however, a framework put in place by the country\u8217\'20\'19s financial authorities has been a boon.\par \par \uc2 Rules announced this year by the Financial Services Agency allow people to pay for goods and services with bitcoin and require cryptocurrency exchanges or remittance operators to be licensed and subject to annual audits. These have given bitcoin official approval.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Japanese have felt that cryptocurrencies are a scary thing but trading volumes have increased as many now see it as trustworthy thanks to government approval,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Yusuke Otsuka\uc2 , chief operating officer at Coincheck, a bitcoin exchange.\par \par \uc2 The FSA issued operating licences to 11 bitcoin exchanges late last month. Coincheck has applied for a licence and is hoping to receive approval next month, Mr Otsuka says.\par \par \uc2 The new digital currency rules come as other governments clamp down on cryptocurrencies. China, for instance, has banned companies from issuing their own virtual currencies and is cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges.\par \par \uc2 However, for Japan, cryptocurrencies sit within the realm of fintech. The government and banking leaders hope that this sector\u8217\'20\'19s businesses \u8212\'20\'14 ranging from \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 -led investment advisory groups to cloud data storage \u8212\'20\'14 will free up cash sitting in bank deposits and reignite the economy.\par \par \uc2 There has been domestic hand-wringing over the investment going into fintech ventures in Japan compared with that in other developed countries. Japan\u8217\'20\'19s fintech sector, seen as a laggard, had investments of $65m in 2015. This compares with $12bn in the US, $974m in the UK and $69m in Singapore, according to consultants \uc2 Accenture\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re hoping that fintech will change economic and corporate activity,\u8221\'20\'1D says Takuya Fukumoto, director of industrial finance in the economy, trade and industry ministry. The ministry set out the government\u8217\'20\'19s vision in August, calling for an increase in cashless consumer payments, digitising back-office functions and new technologies to enhance cash flow between companies.\par \par \uc2 Japanese banks, worried that fintech ventures will become mainstream players, are trying to gain exposure to new technologies by either creating a business or investing in a start-up.\par \par \uc2 Kazuhisa Shibayama, founder and chief executive of WealthNavi, a \u8220\'20\'1Crobo-advisory\u8221\'20\'1D company that offers customers investment advice provided by AI, has been helped by the government\u8217\'20\'19s push for fintech businesses.\par \par \uc2 When he started his company two years ago, the financial technology sector was not as well known as today.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI was only told by venture capital investors after I started that my company was part of the fintech sector and that it was what people described as \u8216\'20\'18robo-advisory\u8217\'20\'19,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Shibayama.\par \par \uc2 He points out that for many fintech entrepreneurs, technology is only a tool to offer users better services at a cheaper price.\par \par \uc2 Many feel that unlike Japan\u8217\'20\'19s manufacturing sector, where companies introduced the notion of kaizen, or continual improvement, financial services might have been left behind.\par \par \uc2 Anecdotally, Mr Shibayama says, the new enthusiasm for fintech among businesses and investors has led to more venture capital firms looking for investments.\par \par \uc2 However, fintech entrepreneurs and start-ups are scarce, he adds, with young people still choosing the traditional route of looking for jobs in established companies.\par \par \uc2 The fintech arena also struggles to attract many of Japan\u8217\'20\'19s IT engineers and programmers, who tend to enter the country\u8217\'20\'19s thriving gaming sector.\par \par \uc2 While some may end up in financial services, the cultural gap between the two industries can be hard to bridge.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171017edah00bt8\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Architect A. Eugene Kohn recalls touring a windswept rail yard on Manhattan's far west side in 2005 and being doubtful about its potential for commercial development.\par \par \uc2 "Who in the world would want to live over here or work over here," Mr. Kohn, whose firm went on to become the master planner of the site, recalled thinking at the time. "Who is going to put the money up?"\par \par \uc2 Last month, lead developer Related Cos. took another big step toward answering those questions by announcing it had completed the $3.8 billion financing of 50 Hudson Yards, what will be the development's biggest tower.\par \par \uc2 The deal increased to $18 billion the total amount of equity and debt raised for the first seven buildings in the project, the first phase of which spans several blocks from West 30th to West 34th streets between 10th and 11th avenues. The anchor tenant for 50 Hudson Yards, asset manager BlackRock Inc., is the latest blue-chip firm to agree to move to the 28-acre development.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the capital sources for the development that is rising like a new Manhattan mountain range reads like a who's-who list of big-name global financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 The roster speaks volumes about the sources of capital for megaprojects at what seems to be a late stage in a lengthy bull market in commercial real estate.\par \par \uc2 For starters, most of the debt and equity capital sources are from overseas. U.S. banks \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 . and \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 . were the lead banks on the construction financing for two of the seven buildings in the first phase of development. But foreign lenders from 11 countries have provided the bulk of the debt. The list includes \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of China Ltd\uc2 ., \uc2 HSBC Holdings PLC\uc2 , \uc2 Credit Agricole SA\uc2  and Children's Investment Fund of the U.K.\par \par \uc2 U.S. banks have been more wary than foreign institutions of construction financing since the 2008 financial crisis. "With all the regulatory burdens on U.S. banks these days, they are very cautious about having too much commercial real estate exposure," said \uc2 Jeff Blau\uc2 , Related's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Foreign banks held $71.6 billion in loans backed by U.S. commercial real estate at the end of the second quarter of this year, according to debt tracker \uc2 Trepp LLC\uc2 . That is up from $59.3 billion at the same time in 2016 and $38.3 billion in the second quarter of 2015, Trepp said.\par \par \uc2 Much of the equity capital for Hudson Yards also is coming from foreign investors, with the exception mostly of Related and some of the project's tenants that have bought their spaces, like \uc2 Time Warner Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 KKR & Co\uc2 . For example, Related's main partner on the project is \uc2 Oxford Properties Group\uc2 , the real estate investor for \uc2 OMERS\uc2 , one of Canada's largest municipal pension plans.\par \par \uc2 The other equity investor in 50 Hudson Yards is the U.S. unit of \uc2 Mitsui Fudosan Co\uc2 ., one of Japan's largest real estate companies. Mitsui also provided the lion's share of the equity for 55 Hudson Yards, an office tower under development where tenants will include hedge fund \uc2 Third Point LLC\uc2  and law firm \uc2 Cooley LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The lopsided participation of foreign investors partly reflects the appeal of the U.S. as a haven for investments and of construction projects as a source of higher yield in a low-interest-rate world. Some major financial institutions, like Oxford, have been active investors globally because their home markets are too small to provide enough opportunity.\par \par \uc2 "You can very quickly grow out of Canada," said Blake Hutcheson, Oxford Properties Group's chief executive. "Most of our growth has been in foreign markets."\par \par \uc2 Also, some of the traditional U.S. providers of equity capital in real estate development, like some pension funds, have had less of an appetite for such risk after getting clobbered during the last recession.\par \par \uc2 "They had to write down a lot of those assets," said \uc2 Chris Ludeman\uc2 , global president of capital markets at \uc2 CBRE Group Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Overall, foreign appetite for U.S. commercial property has increased during this decade. In the second quarter of 2017, Canadian investors purchased $4.1 billion of property, up 39% from the same period last year, according to data firm \uc2 Real Capital \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Investors outside of North America accounted for close to $50 billion in deals in the first quarter. Those represented 13% of all U.S. transaction volume by midyear 2017, down from 16% one year earlier, but still above the 10% hit at the end of 2014, Real Capital said.\par \par \uc2 Analysts said the high foreign participation in projects like Hudson Yards could be a sign that a downturn isn't imminent. It shows "an increased confidence that the business cycle is not likely to roll over and therefore the underlying economics of projects like these remains viable," said \uc2 Larry Hatheway\uc2 , chief economist of \uc2 GAM Holding AG\uc2 , a global asset management firm.\par \par \uc2 Of course, the high level of recent foreign investment in the U.S. could be a danger sign. Japanese investors infamously purchased Rockefeller Center and other trophy U.S. assets just before the commercial property market collapsed in the recession of the early 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Still, many don't think a sharp downturn is on the horizon. John Macomber, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School, points out that the market hasn't seen the kinds of surge in leverage or new supply that often precedes a downturn. "I don't see a huge systemic correction," he said in an email.\par \par \uc2 But he also added: "Of course, I didn't see 2008 coming either."\par \par \uc2 Write to Peter Grant at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:peter.grant@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 peter.grant@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171017edah002xm\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Morgan\uc2  's Jamie Dimon May Hate Bitcoin, but He Loves Blockchain; Bank rolls out a pilot program to use the record-keeping technology to speed global payments\b0\par\par\uc2 By Emily Glazer \par \uc2 582 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 October 2017\par 20:46\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal Online\par \uc2 WSJO\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive \uc2 James Dimon\uc2  recently trashed the digital currency bitcoin as a fraud that will blow up. But he is still enamored with the technology that underpins it and other virtual currencies.\par \par \uc2 The latest sign came Monday, when the nation's largest bank rolled out its next pilot program to use the record-keeping technology, known as blockchain. The initiative will enable the faster, more secure transfer of cross-border payments between \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  , \uc2 Royal Bank of Canada\uc2  and \uc2 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 The new program doesn't use and won't trade bitcoin, which has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/09/12/jamie-dimon-says-bitcoin-is-a-fraud-that-will-blow-up"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 generated skepticism  }}}\uc2 from a wide variety of financiers, including Mr. Dimon and BlackRock CEO \uc2 Laurence Fink\uc2  . But it will use technology that underpins the second-largest virtual currency behind bitcoin, Ethereum .\par \par \uc2 Both cryptocurrencies have soared this year in part due to optimism about the blockchain technology they use to track trades. In \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's case, executives say the technology can dramatically speed up global payments\par \par \uc2 Processing cross-border payments today means dealing with a complex web of layers of communication between various participants to verify and process transactions. In some cases, global transactions from individuals or large corporations that could take as long as 15 days now could be shaved down to hours.\par \par \uc2 The new network will essentially link bank information together through a secure distributed ledger. That better connects the parties, who will continue to keep reams of their own information on separate private servers. Connecting the data through the shared network should significantly reduce the number of steps needed, for instance, to check and rectify mismatches in a cross-border payment.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  receives on average 150,000 inquiries on payments annually. Those inquiries can range from getting the full client name, address or date of birth to a digit missing from an account number, said Emma Loftus, head of global payments and FX for J.P. Morgan Treasury Services.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Loftus added that the bank will also use its traditional payment methods as it tests the pilot.\par \par \uc2 RBC and ANZ are the first two banks to join the network, dubbed Interbank Information Network, but \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  hopes to increase the number of bank partners to about two dozen in the next six to 12 months, she said. Executives at RBC and ANZ said they joined with \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  in efforts to improve their cross-border payments.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  has used blockchain technology to improve processes in securities, derivatives, custody services and transaction banking. The bank recently had about a half a dozen prototypes in the works using blockchain. This latest use has been in the works for about six months, said Umar Farooq, head of channels, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and innovation for the bank's treasury services division.\par \par \uc2 The efforts fall in line with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/10/13/why-james-dimon-and-larry-fink-arent-buying-bitcoin/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 comments from Mr. Dimon }}}\uc2  on Friday in which he criticized bitcoin as having "no actual value" and predicted "governments are going to crush it." But he praised technology innovations that could come from blockchain.\par \par \uc2 "We actually use it. It will be useful for a lot of different things," Mr. Dimon said at a conference in Washington. "God bless the blockchain."\par \par \uc2 Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Emily Glazer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:emily.glazer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 emily.glazer@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171016edag001jl\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Morgan\uc2  's Jamie Dimon May Hate Bitcoin, but He Loves Blockchain; Bank rolls out a pilot program to use the record-keeping technology to speed global payments\b0\par\par\uc2 By Emily Glazer \par \uc2 582 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 October 2017\par 20:46\par \uc2 WSJ Pro Cybersecurity\par \uc2 RSTPROCY\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright \u169\'00\'A9 2017, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive \uc2 James Dimon\uc2  recently trashed the digital currency bitcoin as a fraud that will blow up. But he is still enamored with the technology that underpins it and other virtual currencies.\par \par \uc2 The latest sign came Monday, when the nation's largest bank rolled out its next pilot program to use the record-keeping technology, known as blockchain. The initiative will enable the faster, more secure transfer of cross-border payments between \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  , \uc2 Royal Bank of Canada\uc2  and \uc2 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 The new program doesn't use and won't trade bitcoin, which has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/09/12/jamie-dimon-says-bitcoin-is-a-fraud-that-will-blow-up"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 generated skepticism  }}}\uc2 from a wide variety of financiers, including Mr. Dimon and BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink. But it will use technology that underpins the second-largest virtual currency behind bitcoin, Ethereum .\par \par \uc2 Both cryptocurrencies have soared this year in part due to optimism about the blockchain technology they use to track trades. In \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  's case, executives say the technology can dramatically speed up global payments\par \par \uc2 Processing cross-border payments today means dealing with a complex web of layers of communication between various participants to verify and process transactions. In some cases, global transactions from individuals or large corporations that could take as long as 15 days now could be shaved down to hours.\par \par \uc2 The new network will essentially link bank information together through a secure distributed ledger. That better connects the parties, who will continue to keep reams of their own information on separate private servers. Connecting the data through the shared network should significantly reduce the number of steps needed, for instance, to check and rectify mismatches in a cross-border payment.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  receives on average 150,000 inquiries on payments annually. Those inquiries can range from getting the full client name, address or date of birth to a digit missing from an account number, said Emma Loftus, head of global payments and FX for J.P. Morgan Treasury Services.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Loftus added that the bank will also use its traditional payment methods as it tests the pilot.\par \par \uc2 RBC and ANZ are the first two banks to join the network, dubbed Interbank Information Network, but \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  hopes to increase the number of bank partners to about two dozen in the next six to 12 months, she said. Executives at RBC and ANZ said they joined with \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  in efforts to improve their cross-border payments.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  has used blockchain technology to improve processes in securities, derivatives, custody services and transaction banking. The bank recently had about a half a dozen prototypes in the works using blockchain. This latest use has been in the works for about six months, said Umar Farooq, head of channels, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and innovation for the bank's treasury services division.\par \par \uc2 The efforts fall in line with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/10/13/why-james-dimon-and-larry-fink-arent-buying-bitcoin/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 comments from Mr. Dimon }}}\uc2  on Friday in which he criticized bitcoin as having "no actual value" and predicted "governments are going to crush it." But he praised technology innovations that could come from blockchain.\par \par \uc2 "We actually use it. It will be useful for a lot of different things," Mr. Dimon said at a conference in Washington. "God bless the blockchain."\par \par \uc2 Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Write to Emily Glazer at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:emily.glazer@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 emily.glazer@wsj.com }}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20171017edag0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The move is part of a global trend of central banks and regulators reassessing overnight interest rates, most prominently Libor, in the wake of scandals.\par \par \uc2 "The whole rationale behind all of this is to move away from questionable practices," said Michael Huertas, a banking lawyer with Baker McKenzie in Frankfurt.\par \par \uc2 Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-calls-time-on-scandal-hit-libor-1501148216"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 being phased out over the next five years}}}\uc2 . The benchmark, used to set the price of trillions of dollars in loans and derivatives world-wide, is an imperfect measure: It is based on asking banks to estimate how much it might cost them to borrow from other banks. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/libor-a-eulogy-for-the-worlds-most-important-number-1501170720"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Libor's malleability was made clear in a series of scandals}}}\uc2  that resulted in financial penalties for banks and prison time for traders.\par \par \uc2 The ECB's new rate, in contrast, is based on actual transactions. The central bank says its new rate is meant to supplement existing ones, not necessarily replace them. But given the failures of the private-sector rates, it seems reasonable to expect that market participants will increasingly turn to rates provided by the ECB and other central banks.\par \par \uc2 The Federal Reserve in August opened for public comment {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-seeks-comment-on-three-proposed-borrowing-benchmarks-1503605867"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 three proposed reference rates}}}\uc2  for firms using U.S. Treasurys as collateral for short-term loans.\par \par \uc2 In the eurozone, the ECB's move could have implications for citizens who don't generally read specialist financial publications.\par \par \uc2 In much of southern Europe, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-interest-benchmarks-go-negative-banks-may-have-to-pay-borrowers-1428939338"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 base interest rate used for mortgages}}}\uc2  is the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. The rate is based on how much it costs European banks to borrow from each other. The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  estimates that Euribor underpins \u8364\'20\'AC180 trillion ($213 trillion) in contracts.\par \par \uc2 The new ECB rate is officially seen more as a complement to another overnight rate, Eonia, or the euro overnight index average, rather than Euribor. In short, Eonia is based on transaction data, while Euribor is based on quotes provided by banks. But both rely on data submissions that are voluntary and hard to verify, say experts.\par \par \uc2 "The general concept of Eonia and Euribor is similar," said Falko Fecht, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. Both are "susceptible to misreporting," he added.\par \par \uc2 Eonia relies on data from 28 banks, with one contribution from each bank. The new ECB rate envisages collecting data from 52 banks and will rely on individual transactions, resulting in a broader set of data to work with, and one that's harder to manipulate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Fecht said he "very much" expects the ECB's new rate to replace existing benchmark rates on mortgage contracts. Mr. Huertas concurred, with the caveat that much will depend on how the new European rate is determined.\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Major Clearinghouses Can Avoid Liquidity Crunch in Crisis, CFTC Says\par \par \uc2 By Gabriel T. Rubin\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Major clearinghouses for derivatives can withstand substantial stress to the financial system and avoid a liquidity crunch in a crisis, the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  said Monday in a report that marks the second time it has "stress-tested" the entities and found they passed.\par \par \uc2 The CFTC's report came a day after National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said he was worried about whether clearinghouses are being overused, adding that regulators don't have guidelines for resolving a clearinghouse "in an orderly fashion." Mr. Cohn's remarks Sunday at a Group of 30 banking seminar in Washington add to calls from U.S. policy makers to keep a close eye on clearinghouses.\par \par \uc2 The CFTC tested three of the largest U.S. clearinghouses\u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 CME Group Inc\uc2 .'s CME Clearing, \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange Inc\uc2 .'s ICE Clear U.S. and LCH Clearnet Group Ltd.'s LCH Ltd.\u8212\'20\'14and found that each would be able to generate sufficient liquidity to keep markets functioning even if two of their major clearing member banks were to default.\par \par \uc2 Clearinghouses, mostly used by banks and investment firms, are meant to help avoid a marketwide collapse by making sure that either party in a derivatives transaction is paid if the other side falters. Their role has grown since the 2008 financial crisis as regulators encouraged derivatives to be routed through them.\par \par \uc2 Clearinghouses conduct their own tests to determine how they would function under extreme market conditions. While the CFTC tests examined what would happen if two major clearing members defaulted, some clearinghouses test what would happen if as many as four member banks failed simultaneously. Given the size of clearing member banks, such a situation would undoubtedly be in the midst of a major financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 The supersizing of certain clearinghouses after the financial crisis has gotten significant attention from U.S. policy makers in recent months. The House Agriculture Committee held a July hearing devoted to clearinghouse resolution, and Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell has said repeatedly in public remarks that stress tests for clearinghouses must be more robust and reflective of the risk they pose to financial stability.\par \par \uc2 "Central clearing will only make the financial system safer if [clearinghouses] themselves are run safely," Mr. Powell, who is said to be a top candidate for Fed chairman, said in a June speech.\par \par \uc2 The Treasury Department has also taken an interest in stress tests for clearinghouses, saying in its report on capital markets earlier this month that regulators should build on existing tests to make sure clearinghouses have plans for winding down in an orderly fashion in the event of a major crisis.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 's Jamie Dimon May Hate Bitcoin, But He Still Loves the Blockchain\par \par \uc2 By Emily Glazer\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase JPM -0.14% & Co. CEO \uc2 James Dimon\uc2  recently trashed the digital currency bitcoin as a fraud that will blow up. But he's still enamored with the technology that underpins it and other virtual currencies.\par \par \uc2 The latest sign is expected Monday, when the nation's largest bank rolls out its next pilot program to use the record-keeping technology, known as blockchain. The initiative will enable the faster, more secure transfer of cross-border payments between \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 , Royal Bank of Canada RY 0.27% and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. ANZBY 0.96%\par \par \uc2 The new program doesn't use and won't trade bitcoin, which has generated skepticism from a wide variety of financiers, including Mr. Dimon and BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink. But it will use technology that underpins the second-largest virtual currency behind bitcoin, \uc2 Ethereum\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Both cryptocurrencies have soared this year in part due to optimism about the blockchain technology they use to track trades. In \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2 's case, executives say the technology can dramatically speed up global payments\par \par \uc2 Processing cross-border payments today means dealing with a complex web of layers of communication between various participants to verify and process transactions. In some cases, global transactions from individuals or large corporations that could take as long as 15 days now could be shaved down to hours.\par \par \uc2 The new network will essentially link bank information together through a secure distributed ledger. That better connects the parties, who will continue to keep reams of their own information on separate private servers. Connecting the data through the shared network should significantly reduce the number of steps needed, for instance, to check and rectify mismatches in a cross-border payment.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  receives on average 150,000 inquiries on payments annually. Those inquiries can range from getting the full client name, address or date of birth to a digit missing from an account number, said Emma Loftus, head of global payments and FX for J.P. Morgan Treasury Services.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Loftus added that the bank will also use its traditional payment methods as it tests the pilot.\par \par \uc2 RBC and ANZ are the first two banks to join the network, dubbed Interbank Information Network, but \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  hopes to increase the number of bank partners to about two dozen in the next six to 12 months, she said. Executives at RBC and ANZ said they joined with \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  in efforts to improve their cross-border payments.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  has used blockchain technology to improve processes in securities, derivatives, custody services and transaction banking. The bank recently had about a half a dozen prototypes in the works using blockchain. This latest use has been in the works for about six months, said Umar Farooq, head of channels, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and innovation for the bank's treasury services division.\par \par \uc2 The efforts fall in line with comments from Mr. Dimon on Friday in which he criticized bitcoin as having "no actual value" and predicted "governments are going to crush it." But he praised technology innovations that could come from blockchain.\par \par \uc2 "We actually use it. It will be useful for a lot of different things," Mr. Dimon said at a conference in Washington. "God bless the blockchain."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 CFPB Moves Back to Renovated Building Near White House\par \par \uc2 By Yuka Hayashi\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A consumer financial regulator some Republicans have been trying to kill for years is moving back to a fully renovated building in a prime location across from the White House.\par \par \uc2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2 's director, \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2 , is expected to move into the building at 1700 G St. NW this week following a $145 million renovation project. Mr. Cordray's term at the independent agency runs until July 2018 but Republican critics of the bureau have called on President Donald Trump to fire him.\par \par \uc2 The renovated building will house about 1,200 of the bureau's 1,600 employees. The move has taken place in phases in recent weeks and is mostly complete. The transition has been a low-key affair, with no ribbon-cutting ceremony scheduled.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB's Democratic founders, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), hoped the prominent location of its headquarters would raise the public profile of the agency, which was created after the financial crisis to empower consumers. But like much of the CFPB's work, the renovation of a building that once housed the defunct Office of Thrift Supervision became mired in partisan controversy.\par \par \uc2 The move comes at a pivotal time for the six-year-old agency. Mr. Cordray might step down soon to run for Ohio governor, and the CFPB is likely to go through a significant overhaul once a Trump appointee takes over its helm.\par \par \uc2 Yet the relocation is another example of how the CFPB is pressing ahead with its longstanding agenda despite pressure from Congress and the White House to curb its power. Since Republicans won the White House, the CFPB has brought enforcement actions at a steady pace and rolled out two major regulations in recent months\u8212\'20\'14on payday loans and arbitration\u8212\'20\'14despite opposition from industry and Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The bureau's opponents have criticized the building project for years.\par \par \uc2 House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) reproved its glass staircase and a waterfall in the lobby, comparing its building cost to that of Trump World Tower in Manhattan. Mr. Hensarling suggested a cheaper location could have been found elsewhere, such as Reston, Va., a Washington suburb.\par \par \uc2 After an examination of the project in 2015, the Office of Inspector General said the construction costs "appeared reasonable."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cordray has defended the renovation as unfortunate but necessary. The work, managed by the \uc2 General Services Administration\uc2 , includes upgrading air conditioning, plumbing and electrical systems and replacing 35-year-old windows with energy-efficient ones.\par \par \uc2 "This is a government-owned building that needed renovations to properly ensure the health and safety of its occupants," said CFPB spokesman Sam Gilford.\par \par \uc2 During the renovation, which began in 2014, most CFPB employees have been working in a temporary location across town.\par \par \uc2 The 300,000-square-foot building sits across the street from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which houses a majority of White House staff.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB declined to say where Mr. Cordray's office is located. From the street, a large flag with gold trims is visible in a fourth-floor corner office facing toward the White House.\par \par \uc2 "With its headquarters in the heart of Washington, D.C.\u8212\'20\'14just across the street from the White House complex\u8212\'20\'14the new agency will offer a very tangible presence for anyone who comes to our nation's capital," Ms. Warren said in 2011.\par \par \uc2 Built in 1977, the building is an example of Brutalist architecture, which left a number of boxy concrete structures across Washington. It was leased to the CFPB under a 20-year contract by the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , which absorbed the OTS when it was shut down by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law.\par \par \uc2 Regulator Fight Flares Anew Over Arbitration Rule As GOP Gears Up To Vote\par \par \uc2 By Yuka Hayashi\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A war of words between two regulators flared anew Friday over a rule barring financial firms from requiring customers to use arbitration to settle disputes, as the Senate moved closer to a possible vote to reject the initiative.\par \par \uc2 The dispute relates to a regulation unveiled by the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  in July that makes it easier for consumers to bring group lawsuits by banning fine-print requirements for arbitration in financial services contracts. On one side of the fight is the CFPB led by Director \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2 , an Obama appointee whose term runs till next July. Confronting him is acting Comptroller of the Currency \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 , a banking industry lawyer brought in by the Trump administration until a permanent replacement is confirmed.\par \par \uc2 The unusual back-and-forth between the top regulators started when the CFPB rule was announced.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans are gearing up for a possible vote as early as next week on a measure to overturn the rule. It is widely opposed by the financial industry, which has sued to stop it. It isn't clear whether lawmakers have enough votes to kill the rule.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Noreika kicked off the latest chapter earlier Friday with an op-ed in the Hill. In it, he accused the CFPB of failing to disclose data that he said undermined the legitimacy of the rule. Mr. Noreika said an analysis by the regulator he is temporarily running showed an 88% chance that the rule would boost consumer credit costs for consumers, resulting in a 3.5 point increase in credit-card rates.\par \par \uc2 "For an agency that demands transparency from the companies it supervises, the omission is an appalling abdication of the bureau's responsibility to consumers," Mr. Noreika wrote.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB countered Mr. Noreika's attack by publishing a new report on the rule's effect on consumers, arguing there is no statistical evidence it would have a significant impact on credit costs. The bureau also said some of the data it used when designing the rule is confidential information not suitable for publishing.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB said the OCC's analysis is "based on flawed statistics and is contradicted by publicly available historical data that the OCC did not consider."\par \par \uc2 Congressional Republicans hope to use the Congressional Review Act, a legislative tool that allows them to overturn a new regulation with a simple majority vote.\par \par \uc2 The House voted in July to kill the rule; the Senate has until early November.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Andrew Ackerman contributed to this article\par \par \uc2 Social Security Numbers: Hacked, Hated\u8212\'20\'14and Irreplaceable\par \par \uc2 By Telis Demos and Peter Rudegeair\par \par \uc2 No one intended for the Social Security number to become the cornerstone of Americans' financial lives. But it has, and the \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . hack has shown how ill-suited the nine-digit figure is to this role.\par \par \uc2 Now, bankers and policy makers are saying it is time to find a better tool to help establish an individual's identity. The trouble is, at least when it comes to finance, there is no easy replacement.\par \par \uc2 Having a universal, standardized data point for establishing someone's identity has helped fuel the drive toward increasingly seamless digital access to financial services and credit. Millions of consumers can open a bank account or get approved for a credit card online with just a few pieces of information, among them their Social Security number.\par \par \uc2 Alternatives are available, including ones based on smartphones or biometric data. But they each come with their own problems, and rarely have the ubiquity of Social Security numbers.\par \par \uc2 The risk is that new methods of authenticating a person's identity throw sand in the gears of the U.S. consumer credit system, making it slower or more difficult for people to get financing. That could affect the U.S. economy: Americans had $3.7 trillion in outstanding credit in the second quarter, helping to fuel $13.3 trillion in spending\u8212\'20\'14roughly 70% of the total U.S. gross domestic product, according to Federal Reserve data.\par \par \uc2 "There isn't in the market right now a viable singular replacement for a Social Security number," said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security at consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research. "That Social Security number has become a linchpin from an identity point and an authentication standpoint."\par \par \uc2 But the flaws in the status quo are becoming increasingly apparent. The Equifax breach exposed Social Security numbers, along with other vital pieces of information used to authenticate someone's identity, of potentially 145.5 million Americans.\par \par \uc2 That has prompted policy makers to think about ways to cut back on the use of Social Security numbers. Earlier this month, the Trump administration's top cybersecurity official said the Social Security number has "outlived its usefulness." Last week, a top Republican in Congress introduced a bill that would require the major credit-reporting firms to phase out by 2020 the use of Social Security numbers to verify consumers' identities.\par \par \uc2 Despite its pervasiveness, the Social Security number, created in 1936, was "never intended to serve as a personal identification document," according to a history published by the government agency that administers it.\par \par \uc2 Yet, by the 1960s, its use was widespread. Banks began using the identifier to solve their own headaches matching up the account records of "literally millions of Smiths, Joneses, Williamses, and Johnsons," according to a 1968 report by the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "When the banks adopted the Social Security number, it lent legitimacy to the entire idea" in the private sector, said Josh Lauer, an associate professor at the University of New Hampshire and the author of a history of credit-reporting firms.\par \par \uc2 The ABA said at the time that it liked the Social Security number because it was unique, permanent and used by more than 80% of adults. It also said the number was secure because "knowledge of an individual's Social Security number gives no one any access to any information about that individual."\par \par \uc2 Credit-reporting firms such as Equifax also started using the number to help authenticate applicants. Such firms took on the role of stockpiling consumers' digits because the \uc2 Social Security Administration\uc2  made it difficult to cross-check an applicant's information with what it had on file.\par \par \uc2 After 1972, Social Security cards no longer had "Not for Identification" printed on them.\par \par \uc2 The advent of the digital era only accelerated the trend. As banks moved away from branch-based service\u8212\'20\'14in which they could at least eyeball every customer as part of verifying them\u8212\'20\'14toward web and mobile services, the need for a speedy way to identify unknown borrowers increased greatly.\par \par \uc2 The problem, credit specialists said, is that Social Security numbers weren't simply used as numerical versions of a first name to identify a person, but as a keyword to authenticate that the person is who they say they are. "It is basically a public number," said Ram Palaniappan, chief executive of financial-technology startup ActiveHours. "It should have never been used for authentication, to unlock anything."\par \par \uc2 Over the years, banks have defended this usage. In both 2001 and 2006, the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council, a banking industry group, told Congress that by using Social Security numbers to "verify individual identities," credit-reporting firms can "quickly provide financial institutions with accurate credit histories."\par \par \uc2 Restrictions could result in "costly delays" and drive "up processing costs," the group said.\par \par \uc2 More recently, banking industry groups have advocated the use of multiple ways to verify identity. Some lenders have started asking applicants to submit additional electronic documents to prove their identities, such as a picture of a driver's license. Others have enlisted service providers that can pull in additional information about customers behind-the-scenes.\par \par \uc2 One set of those tools scans the features of the computers or smartphones that their customers use to log on to their accounts. It then matches that device history with what they have on file. Another tool looks at behavior quirks of customers, such as how long they take to type in their credentials, and flags logins that look unusual.\par \par \uc2 Consumers may also simply be issued new identifiers. For example the government agency overseeing Medicare next year will begin shifting away from its current IDs, based on Social Security numbers, and issue new, unique codes.\par \par \uc2 While some of those processes could make the credit system more cumbersome, that might be the price to pay to ditch Social Security numbers. "Lenders will have to introduce friction. That's the only stopgap that works today," said Thomas Nicholas, chief executive of Alloy, an identification software startup that works with banks. "There may be long-term, frictionless solutions. But the rollout of that\u8230\'20\'26might be decades."\par \par \uc2 EU's Dombrovskis Sees Trump Team Cooperating Positively on Financial Rules\par \par \uc2 By Ryan Tracy\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14European officials see cooperation with the Trump administration on financial sector oversight "developing in a positive way," according to a top official who met with U.S. regulators on Friday.\par \par \uc2 European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis in an interview said \uc2 European Union\uc2  fears about President Donald Trump's financial deregulatory agenda haven't been realized.\par \par \uc2 "We had certain concerns after having listened to President Trump's announcements of doing a big number on Dodd-Frank and what the implications of that would be," Mr. Dombrovskis said, referring to the U.S. president's promises to dismantle the 2010 financial regulatory law.\par \par \uc2 "What is reassuring for us [is] we are not seeing a push toward financial sector deregulation," but rather the U.S. and Europe are both seeking "targeted adjustments" to the regulatory regime, he said. "There is a clear understanding of the lessons learned from the crisis."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis leads financial-services policy work at the EU's executive arm and spoke after recent meetings with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton and other senior U.S. officials.\par \par \uc2 One example of cooperation occurred Friday when U.S. and European policy makers agreed on steps toward harmonizing postcrisis swap rules. The moves will allow U.S. and European firms to follow home region rules while doing business across the Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 "These measures are critical to maintaining the integrity of our swaps markets," \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said at a joint press conference with Mr. Dombrovskis.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis has expressed concerns in the past about signals from the Trump administration that it would pare back regulations the Obama administration had agreed to implement as part of international agreements.\par \par \uc2 For instance, a report from the Treasury Department in June suggested that the U.S. pause work on rules related to banks' liquidity and trading books.\par \par \uc2 After meeting with U.S. officials, Mr. Dombrovskis said it appears they are willing to work with other countries to recalibrate the rules, rather than pulling away from them unilaterally.\par \par \uc2 "It was also clear that the U.S. is willing to work on those standards," he said. "What we are emphasizing is not to depart unilaterally from the agreements and I would say today's meetings were also more reassuring in this regard\u8230\'20\'26. We currently see that there is commitment for international financial cooperation."\par \par \uc2 Asked about the progressing international discussions about modifications to bank capital rules, Mr. Dombrovskis said "we believe that the agreement is within reach."\par \par \uc2 That was consistent with comments earlier Friday by William Coen, secretary-general of the Basel Committee group of global bank regulators, which is working on sticking points between U.S. and European regulators. The outlines of the agreement are "fairly clear," Mr. Coen said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis also gave an upbeat assessment of the global economy, saying he sees "broad-based economic growth" across the world.\par \par \uc2 He said European banks in particular have made progress to improve their health, though he acknowledged some large firms have been struggling to achieve sustained profitability, as outlined by the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  in a report earlier this week.\par \par \uc2 "Yes, this is an issue, but we believe that Europe's banking system can cope with this issue," he said, pointing out that over time the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  should be able to raise interest rates, which should help boost bank profits.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis said consolidation between banks could help improve efficiency, and he doesn't believe authorities are holding back mergers: "So far, I would not say that there have been major regulatory barriers for mergers, especially for those banking sectors where those mergers would help to improve profitability and bank efficiency."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Gabriel T.

Rubin\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14U.S. and European policy makers Friday took steps toward harmonizing postcrisis swap rules with agreements that will allow U.S. and European firms to follow home region rules while doing business across the Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  and the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  reached an agreement to recognize each other's collateral rules and vowed to complete a plan to do the same for swap trading venues that operate in each others' jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 Global regulators have generally sought to harmonize their approach to these rules, but progress has been slow, particularly in Europe where the completion of collateral rules was delayed repeatedly. And now, with major new market rules, known as Mifid II, slated to come into effect in Europe in 2018, U.S. and European regulators needed to reach agreements that would allow firms to continue operating in each others' jurisdictions while not causing major market disruption and fragmentation.\par \par \uc2 "These measures are critical to maintaining the integrity of our swaps markets," CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo said at a press conference with European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, who was in Washington for the annual meetings of the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  and \uc2 World Bank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It is important that European counterparts can continue trading in derivatives on authorized U.S. markets," Mr. Dombrovskis said.\par \par \uc2 The agreement on collateral affects derivatives rules in both the U.S. and Europe that require banks to set aside cash as a cushion against the risk of certain swaps trades going bad. The cash cushion, or margin, applies to swaps contracts that aren't routed through central clearinghouses.\par \par \uc2 The second half of the agreement, on trading venues for uncleared swaps, won't be finished until November because the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  must vote on its terms following a period of consultations. But with Mr. Dombrovskis' strong support, the agreement is virtually assured of passage.\par \par \uc2 Under the terms of the trading venue agreement, the CFTC will provide exemptions for certain European swap trading platforms that want to do business in the U.S. After Mifid II goes into effect in 2018, European regulators will give the CFTC a list of Mifid-compliant firms that would be eligible for exemptions from U.S. rules. The CFTC will vote on that exemption once Europe has provided the list of eligible trading platforms, according to Eric Pan, the CFTC's director of the Office of International Affairs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giancarlo said the agreement on trading venues "goes a long way toward assuaging concerns" about market fragmentation that could result from the implementation of Mifid II.\par \par \uc2 The two agreements come as the EU and CFTC are engaged in more tense negotiations over standards for clearinghouse supervision. While an agreement was reached in early 2016 after years of hard-fought negotiations, the deal is now at risk of falling apart amid the uncertainty of Brexit.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  has proposed legislation to have its own regulators, including the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 , oversee U.S. clearinghouses that clear euro-denominated swaps. The proposed law could force clearinghouses that do a large of chunk of business in euros to move into the EU and could subject large, or "systemic," clearinghouses operating outside the EU to tougher oversight, including on-site inspections and access to financial accounts.\par \par \uc2 Currently, under the 2016 agreement, the EU accepts CFTC oversight of U.S. clearinghouses operating in London. The agreement allows major U.S. clearinghouses like \uc2 CME Group Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Intercontinental Exchange Inc\uc2 . to do business with European banks while adhering to U.S. regulatory standards, because both the U.S. and the EU accept each other's rules as equivalent.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giancarlo told a congressional committee earlier this week that the EU plan posed major risks for markets and that he wasn't interested in renegotiating the agreement.\par \par \uc2 "Where I come from, a deal is a deal," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis didn't comment on clearinghouse supervision during Friday's briefing.\par \par \uc2 Two Chinese Firms Bidding for Chicago Exchange Withdraw From Deal\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14Several Chinese investors vying for a piece of the U.S.'s last regional stock exchange have dropped out of the deal, people familiar with the matter said, after the deal weathered intense political criticism of their bid.\par \par \uc2 Two of the Chinese investors, Chongqing Jintian Industrial Co., Ltd. and Chongqing Longshang Decoration Co., Ltd., withdrew in the past two weeks, after the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  sought more details from the participants about their bid, the people said. The SEC's three commissioners are deciding whether to approve the sale after the commission's chairman overrode an earlier staff recommendation to approve it.\par \par \uc2 The Chicago exchange plans to file records with the SEC disclosing the investors' exit as soon as next week, the people said. The filing will probably require the SEC to once again seek public comment on the ownership change, further delaying a decision on a deal that was announced 20 months ago. A ruling from the SEC now likely won't be issued before November.\par \par \uc2 An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Chinese conglomerate Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group Co.\u8212\'20\'14which is seeking to buy 20% of CHX Holdings Inc., with other Chinese and U.S. investors buying the rest\u8212\'20\'14remains the lead investor in the deal. It isn't clear whether existing U.S. bidders plan to increase their stakes to replace the Chinese suitors who dropped out. Alternately, CHX Holdings could recruit new American investors to replace the lost funding, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Chongqing Jintian Industrial Co. Ltd. and Chongqing Longshang Decoration Co. Ltd. had agreed to invest about $8 million as part of a consortium that offered $20 million to purchase the exchange, rising to $25 million if the exchange hit future revenue targets. The firms' managers dropped out about two weeks ago because they felt abused by political criticism of the deal in Congress and the slow progress of approval at the SEC, the people said.\par \par \uc2 Their withdrawal means China-based investors would own just 20% of the exchange, down from 49.5%. The group's U.S. investors include Raptor Group, the family office of former hedge-fund manager \uc2 Jim Pallotta\uc2 ; and Anthony Saliba, a current board member of CHX Holdings who runs an options-trading and technology firm, Matrix Holding Group.\par \par \uc2 Chongqing Jintian is a real estate and construction firm, while Chongqing Longshang produces indoor and outdoor decorations, according to documents that Casin filed with the SEC.\par \par \uc2 The sale sparked a political outcry about a Chinese takeover of a key U.S. market utility, despite the Chicago exchange's tiny role in the American equity market. The Chicago exchange handles less than 1% of daily trading volume.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.) has led a political attack against Casin's role in buying the Chicago bourse. Mr. Pittenger started criticizing the deal just after it was announced, citing national security concerns in a letter to regulators that was signed by 45 other House lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 "While it is alarming that several Chinese government-affiliated companies made it this far in the process, this is a good sign that our system still promotes the well-being and security of our national interests," Mr. Pittenger said Friday.\par \par \uc2 One of Mr. Pittenger's own former staff members, Chas Thomas, has signed up to lobby Congress against the deal. Mr. Thomas's firm, Thorn Run Partners, disclosed on Sept. 28 that it is lobbying alongside Adam Olsen, who represents another group of potential investors seeking to buy the Chicago market if the SEC denies Casin's proposal.\par \par \uc2 The members of Mr. Olsen's investor group remain a secret. He said in late September that his clients are "very substantial." He didn't respond to a request this week seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 CHX Holdings has recently pushed back against Mr. Pittenger's criticism, saying the lawmaker's rhetoric has mischaracterized the deal and the independence of its investors.\par \par \uc2 CHX and Casin executives say the Chinese company is independent of its national government. Casin has 1,300 employees and $1.2 billion in assets, with interests in several banks, insurance and construction firms, according to a recent letter it filed with the SEC. Casin has agreed to make all of its pertinent records available to the SEC and would respond to any regulatory or legal inquiries in the future.\par \par \uc2 "CHX has responded to concerns from legitimate commenters as well as \u8216\'20\'18fake news' comment letters containing blatantly false and misleading information," wrote James Ongena, CHX's general counsel. "A constructive dialogue must be based upon accurate facts."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Randal Quarles Takes Oath of Office\par \par \uc2 Randal Quarles took the oath of office to become the newest member of the \uc2 Federal Reserve board\uc2  of governors Friday, assuming the role of vice chairman for supervision.

"We are hopeful to get a package of something, I don't know what exactly," said Joe Carapiet at a banking conference. He said moving the $50 billion asset threshold for stricter bank rules, tweaking midsize bank stress tests, and help for community banks are under consideration as bipartisan ideas.

Former Fed Vice Chairman \uc2 Donald Kohn\uc2  discussed Mr. Taylor's presentation. They also took questions and comments from the audience, which included Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and former Fed governor Frederic Mishkin. Here is a transcript of the discussion, lightly edited for length and clarity.\par \par \uc2 JOHN B. TAYLOR: OK, thank you very much. Thanks for inviting me. I'm looking forward to this conference. I really enjoyed listening to Eric Rosengren to get us started, a very comprehensive overview. I appreciate that. It's good to see lots of old friends here, and I'm really looking forward to a good discussion today.\par \par \uc2 I thought that the preparation of the \uc2 Boston Fed\uc2  staff was really good. In fact, in my discussion I want to focus on the questions that they addressed. I thought it was a very useful format.\par \par \uc2 One thing I might just say at the beginning, the "Are Rules Made to be Broken? Discretion and Monetary Policy," of course, is the overall title. And in the advertisement, the N in "broken" is falling over sideways. I didn't do that in my picture, but it reminded me, I was telling President Rosengren beforehand, of a little book I like to read to my kids \u8211\'20\'13 actually, now grandkids \u8211\'20\'13 called "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom." "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom" is about letters going up a tree. And it gets so high, overweight, they all fall down and they hurt themselves. And so the N is stooped in and the O is a twisted alley-oop, and the \u8211\'20\'13 all the letters \u8211\'20\'13 K is crying K. It's beautiful, but maybe when we actually get the official version up I'll put the letters from this \u8211\'20\'13 from this book. But it reminded me of that.\par \par \uc2 So let me just go through the questions, because I \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 the questions which the \uc2 Boston Fed\uc2  staff suggested we address \u8211\'20\'13 I address in this session.\par \par \uc2 One is how policy rules have changed over time. I think it's very important.\par \par \uc2 Second, to what extent have ways that we have thought about tying central bankers' hands, and how has that evolved.\par \par \uc2 Third, very important, is how do we demarcate rules versus discretion. It comes up all the time. It's somewhat easier to do that with a little formula than I think to do that in practice.\par \par \uc2 Fourth is how has \u8211\'20\'13 how has this research on policy rules affected the practice of central banking over time.\par \par \uc2 And fifth, how this congressional legislation that Eric referred to fits into the whole discussion.\par \par \uc2 So what's quite comprehensive, and I'll try to stick to that \u8211\'20\'13 those five questions as I go.\par \par \uc2 So starting with how thing have changed over time, I think it's very important to recognize that thinking and research on policy rules really goes back to the beginning of economics. Economists have always been thinking about this. I have some quotes from Adam Smith, Henry Thornton. I have the dates wrong for Thornton, Ricardo basically mixed up \u8211\'20\'13 I apologize \u8211\'20\'13 for my slides. It's correct in the paper. Thornton wrote in 1804, looking for an explicit mechanism for monetary policy. Ricardo, his famous book talked about that you had to have a rule of sorts for central banks. And of course, (Swedish economist Knut) Wicksell, with his formula for interest rates. Irving Fisher \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 theory. (Henry) Simons and (Milton) Friedman, writing about policy rules.\par \par \uc2 And throughout this work, I think if you look at it, you see that the goal of these economists \u8211\'20\'13 and, of course, some of them very involved in policy \u8211\'20\'13 was to find a system that prevented monetary shocks, prevented the kind of strong shocks that affected our system adversely, but also that cushions the economy from other shocks. Because there are other shocks that hit the economy. We know that. They're very important. So you want to have something that's resilient to that. And because of those \u8211\'20\'13 both of those things, reduce the changes of high inflation, financial crises, and recessions.\par \par \uc2 And the idea that came out of this work, as I look at it and reviewed it in a handbook paper with (San Francisco Fed President) John Williams several years ago, was that there was really not so much a choice between a rule and discretion. It was frequently a rule versus a chaotic monetary policy. So just to start it's kind of rules versus chaos, because there really was a concern of a very chaotic monetary policy both causing shocks and not responding to shocks very well. So that motivation, to me, has always been there to some extent. Rules versus chaos may be a little extreme to put it, but basically that was the concept.\par \par \uc2 This idea was taken forward in this century. And I like to think about going back to how models have been used to help us formulate rules. As economists, we use models, economic models.\par \par \uc2 So first model in macro was (Dutch economist Jan) Tinbergen's famous model almost 80 years ago, and it was \u8211\'20\'13 it was actually designed to examine a monetary policy question. And that was: Should the guilder be devalued? Would that stimulate the economy? And his little model said it would stimulate the economy. And soon after he wrote and presented his paper, the Dutch authorities devalued the guilder by 20 percent. And so that had an impact on policy, an impact on monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 This kind of thinking about how to use policy and deliver on policy decisions I think of now as being done in what I'll call "path-space." Tinbergen is famous for distinguishing between instruments and the targets. His calculations in the '30s generated an enormous amount of important research.\par \par \uc2 Cowles Commission, Cowles Foundation, Lawrence Klein developed models really with the purpose of evaluating policy, the distinction between structural and reduced forms. That whole thing was like that. And this research fed into monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 And one example of that was the MPS \u8211\'20\'13 the MIT-PENN-SSRC \u8211\'20\'13 model that came to the Fed and many other central banks, too. You can see this going on. But for the most part, this was what I call "path-space." You've got this structure of the economy summarized in the model, and you simulate different paths for the money supply \u8211\'20\'13 mostly that, but also for the interest rate \u8211\'20\'13 and you saw what would happen. And I think to some extent that's how \u8211\'20\'13 that's a quick, but a reasonable description of how it worked.\par \par \uc2 This began to change fundamentally in the '70s, I think. Part of it has antecedents. It goes back to people I just mentioned, like Milton Friedman, the advantages of rules. But there was a recognition that you didn't have to have a fixed money-growth rule to see the advantages of rules.\par \par \uc2 And so a whole new way of thinking came into play. Models with rational expectations were built. Models with sticky wages and prices were built. And pretty soon you were able to answer \u8211\'20\'13 ask and answer questions about what would be a good rule for policy, what would be a good system \u8211\'20\'13 systematic way to design policy.\par \par \uc2 I mentioned the Brookings (Institution) Model Comparison project here because I think it was very important. It showed how you could use models to see which rule worked better and which didn't. It was really just calculations what works better and what doesn't.\par \par \uc2 And pretty soon after, the Fed's model changed. FRB/US came \u8211\'20\'13 F-R-B/U-S \u8211\'20\'13 replaced the MPS model. And this occurred in many other central banks and around the world. Around the same time, different kinds of lags.\par \par \uc2 Volker Wieland has, I think very constructively and valuably, summarized a lot of this with his macro model database so you can see how this changed over time. So it's certainly not just the Federal Reserve. It's a general phenomenon.\par \par \uc2 Now, as these models came into play, they were very complicated. They included everything, all the things and more that Eric referred to. Very, very complicated models. And as a result, the calculations or the rules that came out of these were very complicated. The rules were very complicated. And that's \u8211\'20\'13 I remember that very well. And that was a problem because they weren't very useful. So complicated, how could you have policy makers use these? You had lags and 15 variables and things.\par \par \uc2 So a change occurred, and the rules became simple. And I was part of that, but many other people were too. And this gave a lot of attraction to the idea, really going back to the beginning of economic thinking on this, that you could have something relatively simple that would not create shocks and could react to shocks well. They were very easy to understand, and for some reason they got very popular, I think. So things like the so-called Taylor rule \u8211\'20\'13 and, obviously, I didn't name it that, but it came into play. And I think one reason is that we \u8211\'20\'13 useful in financial markets. \uc2 John Lipsky\uc2  was working at Salomon Brothers at the time. He talks about that.\par \par \uc2 They turned out to be quite robust, surprisingly, because if you took not just the MPS, not just the FRB/US model but other models, they worked pretty well. I'll give you some references to these work. They were useful in research. They began to help explain things. For example, why does the exchange rate tend to appreciate when inflation rises? If you think \u8211\'20\'13 that's backwards; if inflation increased, maybe the currency should depreciate. But it was the other way, I think, when these policy rules were in play.\par \par \uc2 There were many variations. Again, this is the theme, how policy rules changed over time. There were many variations \u8211\'20\'13 inertial rules; when to include the lagged federal-funds rate; when to include other variables \u8211\'20\'13 the exchange rate, asset prices; when to include \u8211\'20\'13 put forecasts in rather than the actual variable. So many variations and many debates about whether this made sense or not.\par \par \uc2 Many of these I resisted myself. Forecast, yes, that sounds nice, but how good of a forecast? And to what extent do you already \u8211\'20\'13 have you already built in forecasts when you design a policy rule?\par \par \uc2 So those are some of the variations, and some of them are illustrated in the slides that we just saw a few minutes ago. A lot of international impact, as well, or international discussion.\par \par \uc2 Second thing about this thing, very important, is it seemed to work in practice, and I think that surprised lots of people. The best example of this was the work by (Richard) Clarida, (Jordi) Gali and (Mark) Gertler, which showed as the Fed became more rule-like in the sense I'm using, policy got better. And that's the so-called Great Moderation. And you saw inflation become \u8211\'20\'13 come down, the business cycle less volatile, unemployment come down as well. And that really occurred pretty much at the time that you didn't document a change to a more rule-like \u8211\'20\'13 not perfectly, a more rule-like policy that came under (Fed) Chairman (Paul) Volcker.\par \par \uc2 The very important phenomenon that then came, which is still controversial, is what happened, and when did the Great Moderation end, and why. And I've been writing for quite a while, and this is a very \u8211\'20\'13 should be a very important part of our discussion, that it was the deviation from those policies in 2003 and '4 and '5 especially that seemed to be the problem. So, when we think about the pros and cons of simple rules and rules, we need to remember that part.\par \par \uc2 I just looked up \u8211\'20\'13 (Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor) Jon Hilsenrath did a survey of economists' views of this. It was several years ago. He found that roughly 75 percent of economists felt that there was a problem in terms of policy that led to the crisis. Now, surveys are what they are, but it was a quite large fraction. So let's not forget that. And (former Fed Vice Chairman) \uc2 Don Kohn\uc2  has kind of written about it as well.\par \par \uc2 And, of course, there are other explanations: Something went wrong in the financial system. People became too complacent. (Former Bank of England Gov.) Mervyn King and (BOE Gov.) Mark Carney and (former Fed chairman) Ben Bernanke have written about that.\par \par \uc2 But then there's also work that tries to cover longer periods. David Papell, who's here, and his colleagues (Alex) Nikolsko-Rzhevskyy and (Ruxandra) Prodan, have documented as best they can that a more rule-like policy works better in terms of price stability and output stability, these criteria that we use. And there's international evidence. Yevgeniy Teryoshin, who's a student at Stanford, is working on this. OK. So that's this.\par \par \uc2 Now, just to continue this idea of rules changing over time briefly \u8211\'20\'13 because they're still changing, and partly because of the crisis, you know, what went \u8211\'20\'13 what went on in the crisis. So there's a renewed interest in nominal (gross domestic product) targeting, a lot of discussion of that.\par \par \uc2 The effect of lower bound or the zero lower bound has generated a huge amount of work. I think in some sense money-growth rules are coming back. There's people who want to look at those because they don't have a zero bound issue.\par \par \uc2 There's, I think, a very important work by (David) Reifschneider and Williams. It's meta rule \u8211\'20\'13 meta rule where, when the \u8211\'20\'13 when the funds rate is hitting close to \u8211\'20\'13 zero or close to zero, you have extra forward guidance about it staying low in the future. That paper was written before. It was written in 1999, by the way. It's been out there a long time. It's very important.\par \par \uc2 There's price-level targeting as an alternative. That's, to some extent, to the problems of the low inflation, higher inflation target.\par \par \uc2 There's the what I call R-star wars. And this is, in a sense, a debate we're having. Did R-star fall, as we saw in the charts before? And Thomas Laubach and John Williams have written a lot about that, and this is \u8211\'20\'13 the most recent work is with (Kathryn) Holston. They find it does, and it's very close to the chart that you showed us a few minutes ago. And so that has to be taken into account, and the rules are changing for that reason.\par \par \uc2 And then, finally, I think it's important to look at the future a little bit here. To me, nowcasting has changed a lot of this. It used to be that we \u8211\'20\'13 you know, it was hard to put the current quarter into these rules. Now it's not that hard. Nowcasting is much better.\par \par \uc2 And, of course, digital central bank currency. Mike Bordo and Andy Levin have done a paper on how that's going to affect central bank decision-making, and I think that's important for the future.\par \par \uc2 OK. So that's the summary of what has happened as background.\par \par \uc2 Now the second thing, which I'll try to go through a little more quick \u8211\'20\'13 second charge \u8211\'20\'13 was the reasons for tying central bankers' hands evolved. So I find this question a little difficult, because I don't think of policy rules as reasons to tie central bankers' hands. I've never thought of these as tying central bankers' hands, never. To me they are ways to make monetary policy better. There are ways for central bankers to use them to make policy better.\par \par \uc2 And I made a list of the reasons for policy rules 20 years ago. You know, the time-inconsistency problem. It's easier to explain policy, I think, if you have some principles. There's less short-run political pressure, greater independence. It reduces uncertainty if you're clearer what you're doing. This is \u8211\'20\'13 teaching the art and science of central banking, I can't emphasize that as much as \u8211\'20\'13 you know, I go around the world and you talk to central bankers, they love something \u8211\'20\'13 especially if they haven't been a central banker until the day they're on their job. (Laughter.) I mean, they like to have this. And accountability and benchmarking.\par \par \uc2 And when I look at these reasons, I think these are reasons why you should have a strategy of policy. And my good friend \uc2 George Shultz\uc2  and others \u8211\'20\'13 you know, he's had many Cabinet positions, including secretary of state \u8211\'20\'13 and emphasizes, as I do, a strategy \u8211\'20\'13 not so much a little formula but a strategy. And if you don't have a strategy, you don't get anywhere. So in many respects, these rules are ways to think about strategies, and they don't have to be as precise as that.\par \par \uc2 While we're talking about the idea of limits, sort of a side but important point is that for an independent agency of government there has to be limits. It can't do everything, and part of creating it is you don't do everything. And so that seems, to me, go without saying. And granted independence, one needs a well-defined and somewhat limited purpose. I think we all agree to that. The question is, how do we apply it in practice? So it's a related point.\par \par \uc2 Now, there have been \u8211\'20\'13 has been an evolution of reasons not to use policy rules, and they do have this idea of you don't want to tie central banks' hands. So I'll give you one example, and that's from (former Treasury Secretary) \uc2 Larry Summers\uc2 . He and I had a debate a few years ago, and he \u8211\'20\'13 I quote him: "I'd rather have a doctor that most of the time didn't tell me to take some stuff, and every once in a while said I need to ingest some stuff." That would be a doctor whose advice, believe me, would be less predictable, but he would like.\par \par \uc2 So the idea is you have a very smart \u8211\'20\'13 this is one person, OK, and not a committee \u8211\'20\'13 who makes the decision. And it's forget about the rules, forget about strategy, forget about everything, and it's right. It seems to me that misses an enormous amount of progress that has occurred in medicine, and that is the idea of checklists for surgeons, for doctors, for anything. And there's \u8211\'20\'13 people have been writing about this, and it's a way to improve medicine. And if doctors start to wing it and go off their checklist, it usually causes problems. So put that in mind when you think about statements like this. I write: "Checklist-free medicine is dangerous, like rules-free monetary policy."\par \par \uc2 Another thing, which we'll come back to later in this conference, is the idea of constrained discretion. So this is \u8211\'20\'13 this is \u8211\'20\'13 Bernanke has written about this a lot, and the idea here is all you need is a goal \u8211\'20\'13 2 percent inflation, something on unemployment \u8211\'20\'13 and then you do whatever you need to do. Don't need to talk about the strategies for instruments at all. And it is an appealing term, but to me it's not really a description of a strategy if you don't talk about what you're doing with the instruments, OK? And when I say the evidence is that it has not worked very well, I'm talking about the poor performance over the last dozen years and the Great Recession and things like that, because I think there is a sense in which that approach didn't work. We're going to debate this, I understand. But it is quite different. It's different than an instrument rule, instrument strategy approach.\par \par \uc2 And then the last thing I'll mention in this section is the idea of forecast targeting, which Lars (Svensson) will discuss a lot. It's quite different from the constrained discretion, because there's a specific way to think about the settings of the instruments of policy, the interest rate, so that they deliver certain outcomes with respect to it. And this is my little picture of inflation and output. And so in this case you'd set your instruments so that the forecast of those are in a certain range.\par \par \uc2 And they do have advantages over other instrument rules because they include more information. They're inherently more complex. They include everything in the model. And therefore, they're somewhat model \u8211\'20\'13 they are model-dependent. And so we have to worry about that. And I think also, for that reason, you have to find a way how \u8211\'20\'13 how do you use it for accountability or communication.\par \par \uc2 I think this is progress. I would not say that this is not a way to go, by any means. But I think this is progress, but you do need to worry about these \u8211\'20\'13 what's the model on how you do the diagnostic checks. I have argued in a paper gave at the \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 by the way, that a method like this might very well fit into the legislation that's passed the Congress.\par \par \uc2 OK, third thing: demarcation of discretion. I think this is a very important issue. McCallum, this is from his handbook paper a while ago. When it comes to practical applications of the behavior of actual central banks, the distinction is not easily drawn. And when I wrote the paper, whenever it was, '93, the whole purpose was to go away from simple algebraic formulations and, as I say, to study the role of policy rules in a world where simple algebraic formulations of such rules cannot and should not be used mechanically by policy makers. So, anyway, that's the whole \u8211\'20\'13 that's the whole purpose. How can you make this workable in a real world where discretion is inherently needed?\par \par \uc2 It was that kind of decision, that kind of definition that led me and others, to some extent, to say that the '85-2003 period was more rule-like compared to immediately before and immediately before. And of course, the policy performance was better. Now, to be more formal about this you have to be more specific. And that's what David and his colleagues \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 have done. They've defined discretion as deviations from particular rules. And I don't see any way around that in terms of doing the research on this. Got to do something like that. I did it more informal. I think the more informal way is correct. But it's an issue to address.\par \par \uc2 So when you think about this in practice, there's lots of things that make it more complicated. And we're going to come back to some of this in this conference as well. So, for example, if you have a policy rule that you're analyzing with a model, it depends on whether you have a lag-dependent variable. And you know from doing any kind of econometrics the leg-dependent variables always show up in time series. They're just \u8211\'20\'13 they sometimes mimic zero correlation. So they're always going to be there. And is that the way to think about policy?\par \par \uc2 And deviations from that are going to be much different than deviations from a simple kind of Taylor rule. It absorbs a lot of stuff that you might not think is the right policy. So it's very hard. There's some optimal reasons to have that. And I'd say we need to think about when we do the research. I don't think there's anything wrong with the approach that I've suggested, but it needs more work.\par \par \uc2 One thing I just would add here, in some cases there are efforts \u8211\'20\'13 and you've all gone through them \u8211\'20\'13 to make deviations from simple rules more systematic, to try to find a way to do that. So one example I have in the \u8211\'20\'13 and I talked about this a lot at the time, 2007, 2008 \u8211\'20\'13 there was this big movement in Libor-OIS spread. We didn't know what was going on. John Williams and I wrote about it. We thought it was a sign there was a problem with the banks. A lot of people ignored us. But there was a problem. So you want your policy rule to adjust for that. In this case, it would be about a 50-basis-points reduction because of the spread between Libor and OIS. Libor, unfortunately, is not as reliable in people's minds as they thought it was then. But the point is still the same.\par \par \uc2 OK. Last two things on the list. The influence of this on central banking \u8211\'20\'13 I don't think I need to say too much about this. I was surprised, quite frankly, how much these ideas have been discussed in policy circles. Of course, there's been this correlation that I mentioned between rules and performance decisions. But evidence of direct effect is harder to come by. A very good paper by (George) Kahn of the \uc2 Kansas City Fed\uc2 , who went through all the transcripts and records and found, in the early '90s, huge discussions of policy rules at the Fed. And they looked at central banks as well. I think it's \u8211\'20\'13 it would be of some interest to see how this changed \u8211\'20\'13 or to what extent it changed in 2003, '4 and '5. And you really can't rely entirely on the transcripts, because there's lots of discussions that occur in other places. That's just the way it is.\par \par \uc2 So I think it's very important to try to understand that better. But there is a \u8211\'20\'13 really, for me, a striking degree to which these things have been discussed inside central banks. I know this from talking to central bankers. But the deliberation is quite interesting. So one thing that is also very interesting to me is how this seems to have changed a lot recently. And I'll just \u8211\'20\'13 I mention this in the paper. We all know this so well. But and partly it's related to the decision to normalize the balance sheet. And quite a bit of specificity about being predictable and gradual about this is the addendum that was added this past June. It's very specific about, you know, the balance sheet will be reduced in size, the numbers are given. It didn't ask for more than that, it seems to me.\par \par \uc2 It's just different than the discussion of the taper tantrum, which was quite a shock to people. So that's a \u8211\'20\'13 that's a tremendous improvement. This year (Fed Chairwoman Janet) Yellen has given speeches, and (Fed Vice Chairman) Stanley Fischer has given speeches which, again, I think reflect some of these changes. So I quote from Chair Yellen, Janet, earlier this year: When the economy is weak and unemployment is on the rise, we encourage spending and investing by commissioning short-term interest rates lower as a strategy, as a rule. Similarly, when the economy is threatening to push inflation too high down the road, we increase interest rate, as a strategy, as a rule. There's, of course, a 2 percent inflation target. There's a 3 \u190\'00\'BE estimate of the natural rate. And now a discussion of the 3 percent equilibrium federal-funds rate, relatively speaking.\par \par \uc2 So that's a change. Even more than that, in another talk earlier this year, Janet Yellen compared this with other rules. She looked at three. One of them was the Taylor rule. And I just summarized it at the bottom. So the paragraph I wrote sort of has the interest rate reacting to inflation and output, coefficients are not specified. The equilibrium rate is one in that picture. So the Taylor rule, the specific number, so it's not hard to do this comparison. And you might want to compare with something else, but it's not hard. And I think it illustrates how it can be fruitful.\par \par \uc2 And then this summer the monetary policy report of the Fed for the first time, as far as I know, had a whole section comparing decisions with policy rules. And specific statements, these are key principles of good monetary policy, that's a quote. And one of the principles \u8211\'20\'13 this is sometimes called the Taylor principle. I'm not sure who made that name up. The policy rate should be adjusted by more than one for one in response to persistent increases or decreases in inflation. That's in the report that's written. So that's a change. And there's other things in this, but I think what's good here is there's some other influence that is coming. And I think that's important.\par \par \uc2 I'll just mention this is not for the United States. These are some quotes from people who have many different viewpoints \u8211\'20\'13 Paul Volcker, (former head of \uc2 India's central bank\uc2  Raghuram) Rajan, (ECB President) Mario Draghi \u8211\'20\'13 all indicating that we need a more rules-based international system. And I'm written a lot about that. And I think that's something to think about when you're discussing whether a more strategic, more rules-based approach is good for one country. Because it ultimately will lead to a more rules-based international system. And there are many reasons to want that, including these quote from Volcker, Rajan and Draghi, OK?\par \par \uc2 OK, the last thing is this policy rule bill that's passed the (House) Financial Services Committee, passed the House of Representatives. It's now part of the CHOICE Act. I think it's quite important and I'm glad that Eric raised it. So this is actually a proposal I made in 2011. And it was a paper about the proposed legislation. It's quite different from the actual legislation. You can imagine writing legislation is different than writing a proposal no paper. You got to be a lawyer to do that, for one thing. So it's different. But maybe think about this: Why did we start thinking about this?\par \par \uc2 In '92, we didn't talk about legislation. This is something that central bankers can find useful to think about. I think what motivated me at least was policy did seem to go off track. We did seem to lose what was working well before 2003, \u8216\'20\'184, and \u8216\'20\'185, one of these very unusual policies. So there's a reason, and I think the legislation can actually help to normalize policy, which seems to be the intent not just in the U.S. but other countries. I think it's \u8211\'20\'13 it will restore this on a longer-term level. We're going to have deviations in the future.\par \par \uc2 And if you can think a little bit about that just as a counterfactual. You don't know for sure, but imagine that something like this was in place in 2003, and \u8216\'20\'184 and \u8216\'20\'185. Then the chair wouldn't have to explain why we are a little off, why is the rate still low. Maybe we would have had a good explanation, I don't know. But it would have discussed I think more publicly. And that would have been good. It's like the discussion that we're having more recently. So I think there's reasons to do this.\par \par \uc2 The actual legislation \u8211\'20\'13 it's actually called requirements for policy rules for the (Federal Open Market Committee)\u8211\'20\'13 it would require that, and I quote, "the Fed would describe the strategy," strategy's important here, "strategy or rule of the FOMC for the systematic quantitative adjustment of its instruments." And so, first of all, it would be the Fed's job to choose a strategy and describe it. Congress wouldn't do that. The Fed could change its strategy, it could deviate from it, just explain why. It would describe \u8211\'20\'13 it would decide how to describe the policy.\par \par \uc2 The legislation wants the Fed to compare its strategy with some referenced rule. It could be rules, by the way, it doesn't have to be one. And people have raised questions about independence, flexibility, how does the committee decide on a strategy, and other things. But it seems to me that this is a productive way to have a better engagement with the Congress and the public about what seems to be going on in many respects.\par \par \uc2 OK, so just to wrap up, I considered five questions that were part of the agenda, part of the charge. And there are many suggestions and proposals for rules. But if you think about what I just said, almost all of them are based on some kind of models, methodologies, empirical work. It's not just throwing things out, for the most part. At least, there's a lot of analysis going on. I think it's important to continue that. The models are not perfect. They need to be changed. I know the problems pretty well. I know they need to be changed.\par \par \uc2 But one thing to say is because there's many proposals does not imply \u8211\'20\'13 I'll read \u8211\'20\'13 does not imply we should discard a systematic approach. So in any policy situation I've been involved with or I'm aware of, there's lots of strategies to choose from. Foreign policy, think of all the strategies people are thinking about we should choose now. It's the job of the policy makers to choose the strategy and explain it and make it work. So this is not unusual, to have different proposals or different strategies. It's not a reason not to \u8211\'20\'13 not to follow the strategy, not to have as best you can.\par \par \uc2 Second thing: I don't think rules should be viewed as ways to tie central bankers' hands. They are meant to help policy makers make better decisions, and also operate in a democracy, and also operate in a global monetary system, where central banks' decisions affect other central banks. I think it's important to recognize that research distinguishing between monetary policy from rules is difficult. That demarcation is difficult. But it doesn't prevent policy makers from internalizing these strategic principles as they make decisions. It's important for the research to make this distinction as best they can. It is difficult. We'll find out more about that in this conference. But again, it seems to me it's still possible to internalize the idea of having a strategy as best as possible.\par \par \uc2 Research on policy rules has, again, to me, impacted policy in lots of ways. And even the periods of deviation, there's a sense of going back. I think to the extent there's a going back that influences the decisions now. And maybe the impact has waxed and waned. I think it's perhaps coming back, again, based on the evidence that I just showed you. And then, finally, central bank independence is very important. But it hasn't been enough to prevent these swings back and forth. And so, given that Congress has this responsibility under the Constitution, it seems that some legislation \u8211\'20\'13 maybe not exactly what's out there, some modifications \u8211\'20\'13 and then always \u8211\'20\'13 the Federal Reserve Act has always been modified with communication and discussion between the Fed and the Congress. So that should not be left out.\par \par \uc2 Thank you very much. (Applause.)\par \par \uc2 DONALD KOHN\uc2 : Thanks, John. Thanks, Eric and Jeff for inviting me to be back here at this podium. I feel like I've been here a number of times over the years. This discussion, this conversation I've had with John Taylor for probably 30 years' time \u8211\'20\'13 from the hiking trails of Jackson Hole to the witness tables at the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2 . And I've gotten an awful lot out of this discussion. And I've tried to bring some of it back into the Federal Reserve. So I think some of the emphasis on rules, the discussion of rules within the Federal Reserve, certainly I was a strong backer of that. I think \u8211\'20\'13 and obviously you can tell me if I'm wrong \u8211\'20\'13 I started putting these thing in the Blue Book in the mid-'90s. So I think there's definitely a role to be played.\par \par \uc2 I'm not sure I agree with exactly what the role is with John, but it's a valuable time to take stock of where we are. There's the legislation. I also think as we lift off the zero lower bound, the issue of how to adjust that federal-funds rate and the extent to which rules should play in that adjustment becomes, perhaps, a more effective, more cogent kind of discussion. And I would say, I got an awful lot out of reading the paper. It's a really valuable summary of where we are in the discussion and confronts a lot of the issues that have come up. And I commend it very highly. There's a lot of overlap between what I'm saying and what Eric said. I'm not sure \u8211\'20\'13 I'm not sure how much confidence you can take from that. I take some myself.\par \par \uc2 I think one of the issues is \u8211\'20\'13 to emphasize, as Eric did \u8211\'20\'13 is policy makers should be held primarily accountable for achieving their legislative objectives, the so-called dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. And they have been granted a lot of independence to do that, instrument independence. And I think accountability for the setting of the instrument is subordinate to accountability for achieving the goal. And so \u8211\'20\'13 and John just said this, I'm sure he agrees \u8211\'20\'13 the point of the rules and how they fit into policy is whether to \u8211\'20\'13 how they might improve achieving the goals, fostering progress towards the objectives, and explaining how that progress is going to be made, because the explanation is very important, helping private agents form their expectations in a stabilizing way and building trust and confidence in the institution. And I think rules as references can be helpful here.\par \par \uc2 Reading this paper led me to reflect perhaps more deeply on where the lines are and where I disagree. And so a quote from the paper, rules tend to use formulas or equations for the policy instrument at least as a guide \u8211\'20\'13 and those underlines are mine, not John's \u8211\'20\'13 when making decisions. Decisions can be described reasonably well by a stable relationship which shows a consistent reaction to observable events. So as I thought about it, I thought perhaps where we differ a bit here is in the degree of presumption that you're going to follow the rule, and the role of prediction in the rule.\par \par \uc2 So this \u8211\'20\'13 John can tell us whether I've mischaracterized him, but I think the way I see John's view is we look first to an algebraic rule, usually based on a small number of variables. The rule doesn't vary over time, or not much over time. Deviations from the algebra are unusual, otherwise it wouldn't be a rule, require a very strong \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). And you rely on \u8211\'20\'13 and he just said this \u8211\'20\'13 you rely mostly on the current estimated values of upward inflation gaps and R-star.\par \par \uc2 In my view algebraic rules are a reference point to be used for thinking about an explaining policy strategy. But in a complex, ever-changing, poorly understood economy, the presumption for following algebra is weak and the appropriate reference rule can change. And monetary policy \u8211\'20\'13 good monetary policy will be made with a heavy reliance on tradition. Mike Tyson said: Everyone has a plan until they're punched in the face. Dwight Eisenhower said: When preparing for battle, I have always found plans are useless. Planning is indispensable.\par \par \uc2 So I do think we need the role of rules and thinking about the strategy and where you're going, but it's the presumption of adherence that I think divides us to some extent. I think the central irony in some of this, the golden age of rules, 1985 to 2003, was a period in which policy makers weren't trying to follow a rule, right? So certainly, (former Fed Chairman) Alan Greenspan gave several speeches at (the \uc2 Hoover Institution\uc2 ) \u8211\'20\'13 I remember helping write them \u8211\'20\'13 about how following a rule, a strong rule would produce suboptimal policy. And my impression is that the FOMC, although there were discussions of rules, we had it in the blue book, it was part of the discussion, they weren't following it. It was a discretionary policy, but it would adhere to a certain number of principles \u8211\'20\'13 certainly the focus on containing and reducing inflation, following the Taylor principle, but not in a rule-based manner. Remember opportunistic disinflation? So if inflation came down, it kind of cemented in there when we were at three, trying to go to two, but there wasn't a deliberate attempt to go down? So it wasn't rule-based in that way. There was a lot of attention to output and employment and its potential effects on inflation, but there was a lot of discussion about the measurement of the output gap and the role of the output or unemployment gap in causing inflation, and as certainly not an automatic buy-in to those things. Very conscious of policy lags and a lot of focus on the future. So where were \u8211\'20\'13 the incoming data, what were they telling us about where we'd be in six months, a year, a year and a half, two years, and then how would that affect today's policy setting. So not just looking at today's things.\par \par \uc2 And emphasis on risk management. So what sorts of things were we most concerned about? Where would the \u8211\'20\'13 missing would cause the most disutility in leaning that way? That's not really part of the rule. I think Eric pointed that out as well. And a lot of adjustments of the policy setting were perceptions that financial markets had changed, and the translation of a particular federal-funds rate and a particular set of financial conditions had altered over time. So think about the credit crunch in the early '90s, think about the stock market boom which caused interest rates perhaps to be a little higher than the Taylor rule might have said. Even before 2003 or around that time, the Enron/WorldCom junk bond problems which caused spreads to widen \u8211\'20\'13 so there were a constant, constant reassessment of where the policy rule \u8211\'20\'13 what the \u8211\'20\'13 I'm sorry, what the policy rate would imply for output in employment and then what that would imply for inflation.\par \par \uc2 And of course, there were committee discussions and a lot of diverse views brought to the table, and I think that helped to enrich the discussion. So I think there were a lot of principles that were being used, and the rules were discussed increasingly over the 1990s, but especially in the first half of that period they weren't really there. So I guess my question is, why don't we just say to the policy makers whatever you were doing in '85-2003, following a set of principles, continue doing that. Don't obsess on the rule that algebraically, arithmetically describe what you're doing, but keep doing those things. And I think that's a strategy. There's a tendency in this discussion to equate rule and following rule with the word strategy and to say you don't have a strategy if you don't have a rule, and I disagree with that. I think you can have certain principles and ways you react, and that's a strategy.\par \par \uc2 Eric emphasized the role of changes in these unobservable variables, what's the potential GDP, the (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment), R-star, and they certainly did it in a way of using rules. The relationships are also changing. We've already talked to some extent about the relationship of interest rates and the output gap, and we've seen a lot of disappointment, particularly early in the recovery from the Great Recession, to how the economy wasn't responding as much as we thought \u8211\'20\'13 we thought it should to very low interest rates, and then recently now a lot of discussion about what the relationship of the output gap to inflation is. So when you have these uncertainties, I think it makes the adherence to algebraic rules produce less than optimal outcomes. One reason that the activities of the FOMC look like rule-based in that '85 to '03 period is because it was the period of the great moderation, so-called nice period, as Mervyn King dubbed it. Some of that was caused by better monetary policymaking, but I think there are a lot of other factors involved, too. So I think Watson (sp) had a thing about how there were fewer shocks to the system, et cetera. And so it's not just monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 Since then, since 2003, as Eric pointed out, there's been a lot of \u8211\'20\'13 a lot of changes, a lot of differences, the declining R-star, falling productivity growth, huge changes in the financial system and long stretches with policy rates constrained at the effective lower bound that I think made policy rules much less valuable even as guidelines.\par \par \uc2 So what are the problems that we're trying to solve with the policy rules? One of course is the ultimate one is poor outcomes, and recently the slow recovery and low inflation. I guess my impression is that since 2008, following many of the rules called for higher interest rates than actually existed, and many of the people who were advocating rules were highly skeptical of (quantitative easing) and I think past the first quantitative easing, first large-scale asset purchases \u8211\'20\'13 and I guess my concern would be that if we had been following rules over the last several years, the outcomes for the economy would be worse. Inflation would be lower following many of the rules. Outcomes would be worse, inflation would be lower, unemployment would be higher.\par \par \uc2 I think a second issue is accountability. And again, to repeat what I said before, I think if you put too much emphasis on rules, you're focusing accountability in the wrong place. Accountability should be focused on achieving the legislative objectives and explaining how your choices are going to get you there.\par \par \uc2 And then uncertainty: There's been some discussion. John didn't have it in his paper, but he certainly has discussed it before, about how he thought that the Federal Reserve's actions since the Great Recession created more uncertainty about policy going forward and made it harder for private agents to form expectations. So on the left here is the uncertainty index on monetary policy from Davis et al, and at least to my eye \u8211\'20\'13 and the golden age is to the left of the dash line and the bad period is to the right of the dash line \u8211\'20\'13 and it looks to me like uncertainty is certainly no greater than it was during the golden age, and probably a little less.\par \par \uc2 The right-hand chart is the \u8211\'20\'13 a survey that Brookings did \u8211\'20\'13 I think it was early last year \u8211\'20\'13 on how well people understood the Fed's reaction, how was \u8211\'20\'13 how well was the Fed communicating. And you can see the results. I think at least in the markets \u8211\'20\'13 so I think most people felt they had at least \u8211\'20\'13 they understood it sometimes but not always, and some \u8211\'20\'13 and there was a significant amount that thought it was clear or mostly clear. There were people who \u8211\'20\'13 particularly academics who had only a vague understanding or didn't understand the market, which is often complaining about this. The vast majority thought they understood sometimes but not always. So I would say looking at this, there's room for improvement, but it's not so awful. So you can always \u8211\'20\'13 you can always improve. And that's where I think rules could be used.\par \par \uc2 So I do see rules being used to help the Federal Reserve explain what they're doing, why they're doing it. I don't \u8211\'20\'13 I think to a considerable extent the Federal Reserve can replicate in the public what it's doing in private. So as Eric and John described what the FOMC was doing, they were looking at a suite of rules and then talking about where policy was relative to those rules. And I think that \u8211\'20\'13 in that way, it's forcing the Federal Reserve to think about what they're doing in a different kind of way and to explain it in a different kind of way. And I think rules are very helpful in that regard.\par \par \uc2 As John noted, there was a box in the monetary policy report that spelled out five different rules and where things were relative to those rules, and I think that was a helpful addition. David Wessel (director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy) and I suggested that about a year and a half ago, I think, and with long and variable lags \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 I won't take credit for it, but I think it was a good way to go.\par \par \uc2 What was missing from the box, in my mind, was an explanation of why policy had deviated and was deviating from those rules. So it enunciated some principles, as John said, and that was good and showed you where policy was. But it didn't take advantage. So the whole setup was there for saying, yeah, that's what a bunch of rules say and here's where we are, now what factors did we take into account? Why do we think the rules would \u8211\'20\'13 that adhering to these rules would have produced less good outcomes than what we did? So I think \u8211\'20\'13 I think we could take that box and expand it, and it would be a helpful addition to reducing some of that understand sometimes but not always or don't understand or have only a vague understanding. So I think it would be helpful to the Federal Reserve and to the public if the Fed used the rules as reference points for a fuller explanation of what it was doing and why it was doing it, and then \u8211\'20\'13 and that would be a good addition to monetary policy communication.\par \par \uc2 Thank you. (Applause.)\par \par \uc2 MR. TAYLOR: I'll have a few comments. Thanks, Don, very much for your thoughtful comments.\par \par \uc2 I agree completely with your last point, that some comparison with the rules out there, strategies out there with the decisions would be good. I think to some extent when I referred to Janet Yellen's talk earlier this year \u8211\'20\'13 it was San Francisco, actually \u8211\'20\'13 she did some of that \u8211\'20\'13 and so that could be \u8211\'20\'13 in a way, that was a strategy. I just quoted it in my talk. It was \u8211\'20\'13 it was verbal and it was \u8211\'20\'13 but it had many of the features that come close to a strategy.\par \par \uc2 I think the point about during the term of Volcker and Greenspan, it is interesting how the decisions were made. You know more about it than I do. But it did have a rule-like feature. In fact, when I was in the (Council of Economic Advisers) during some of that time and talking to Alan Greenspan quite a bit, and he actually one time said that the Fed deserves an assist in the Taylor rule. So I think there's a sense in which that's the case. So \u8211\'20\'13 but it's definitely true. And the idea that to do what you did in that period is a lesson, is \u8211\'20\'13 in a way that's what we're talking about. Do what you did then \u8211\'20\'13 it worked \u8211\'20\'13 and to try to find a way to do that.\par \par \uc2 I think one \u8211\'20\'13 just one last thing. The \u8211\'20\'13 I mentioned this as well before. The emphasis about disagreement about rules since 2010 is one thing, but the issue in 2003, '04 and '05 is more important to me at this point. There was a sense in which it was always we were going to go back. That was implicit, I think, in a lot of the discussions. But that deviation was huge, in my view, and that's one of the reasons we've been motivated \u8211\'20\'13 I've been motivated myself to come back to this. But anyway, thank you.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: OK. If you want to make a comment or ask a question, raise your \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). They'll come around with a microphone.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you. I'm \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 from the \uc2 Central Bank of Chile\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I wanted to \u8211\'20\'13 a little bit more on the distinction that you make or the similarities that you point out with the forecast-based targeting rule. So, in listening to your remarks, I think it's the notion that these two concepts are not that different. And perhaps you have more information with forecast-based targeting, but also more discretion. And in that sense, from a practical perspective, just a simple rule dominates.\par \par \uc2 So, yeah, at the \uc2 Central Bank of Chile\uc2  we actually follow a forecast-based rule \u8211\'20\'13 not all the way \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 but to a large extent that's what we do. And I would argue that in some situations the implication for monetary policy that arises from the Taylor rule, the simple Taylor rule, are actually quite different. And it's not only a matter of magnitude in a direction, the sign of what we do with policy.\par \par \uc2 Take the example of 2014 and 2015. We had an important fall in the price of copper. That affected the \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 and we had inflationary pressures in Chile. So what did our model said was going to happen in the next year or so? It said, well, inflation will be higher, but eventually, at the two-year horizon, you're going to have \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 output gap, a \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 output gap, and you're going to have lower inflationary pressures. So actually, the forecast-based targeting rule said you have to wait, and actually, you have to start lowering rates. But the Taylor rule basically \u8211\'20\'13 the Taylor rule would have said \u8211\'20\'13 and it did say \u8211\'20\'13 you have to actually raise rates.\par \par \uc2 If we go to the current situation, it's the same but the other way around. The Taylor rule says you need to lower rates, where \u8211\'20\'13 but our forecast-based rule says you need to wait a little bit because probably six months from now you're going to start raising rates. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, in many situations current inflation and current output gap is not a sufficient statistic. I would say it's not even a very good statistic of where we're going to be in a year and a half to two years from now. So \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: If you could just hand the microphone \u8211\'20\'13 thank you.\par \par \uc2 Q: OK. Lars Svensson. OK, I thought this was a very interesting exchange/discussion between John and Don and to hear them present their very thoughtful arguments. We certainly learned a lot from this discussion. (Off mic.)\par \par \uc2 I have \u8211\'20\'13 I have two questions or comments. First, I think John mentioned that Taylor rules or Taylor-type rules performed reasonably well in those models that we used. I think one reason is that there is a certain model bias in favor of Taylor-type rules in the sense that an optimal policy is normally to respond to all the determinant state variables of your target variables, the target variables, say, inflation and unemployment. In most models, the most important state variables are inflation \u8211\'20\'13 and often sometimes the only state variables \u8211\'20\'13 then it's pretty \u8211\'20\'13 it's pretty obvious responding to those two will normally give good outcomes. In the real world, of course, inflation and output is not \u8211\'20\'13 are not sufficient bases. There are lots more state variables, information relevant. For instance \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 experience. So in the real world, the set of state variables is much larger, and often there's lots of important information outside current inflation. And those things are usually not in our models.\par \par \uc2 My second point is that John told at the end about the targeting rules and forecast targeting, and made the point that then you can include more information in determining the forecast, but also that there is some model dependence there. I would actually say that there can be model dependence, but also you can actually incorporate judgment. There's a lot of information outside our models. You can actually have \u8211\'20\'13 in practice, many forecasts have been used in central banking and monetary policy are kind of model averages. You look at the forecast of different models and you take an average of them. So, in a way, you're taking into account \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). And the more you think about it, it's actually taking into account all information that you think is relevant. And in the end, the lack of judgment is not \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 MISHKIN: John, one thing that you said that \u8211\'20\'13 I actually think is actually not only wrong, but also unfair, that \u8211\'20\'13 Ben Bernanke and the whole issue of constrained discretion. And obviously, I'm involved in this because it was Ben and I that coined the term in our discussion of inflation targeting.\par \par \uc2 When you read what we talked about, both in the initial paper but also the book that we wrote, it's very, very clear that what we're talking about is a strategy, and it's very consistent with some of the principles that you've talked about. And I don't \u8211\'20\'13 you know, I could be wrong \u8211\'20\'13 I don't know everything that Ben's said since we wrote that \u8211\'20\'13 but I don't think it was inconsistent with that view. And in particular, we talked a lot about \u8211\'20\'13 in that book and in the paper, we talk a lot about the issue about the need for communication to talk about exactly the things you discussed, which is how are you setting policy today in order to achieve the actual objective of inflation targeting and actually to constrain discretion.\par \par \uc2 And I'm going to talk a lot about this later on. You're starting the conference, I'm ending it, so we'll have a long-running debate over this thing. But I do think that there is an issue that is the case, which is how do we actually improve discretion and constrain discretion? And I think I'm going to talk \u8211\'20\'13 that's something I'm going to talk a lot about later on.\par \par \uc2 But I really do think it's absolutely unfair to characterize Ben as thinking that, yes, you talk about a goal, and then you do whatever you want. It's not consistent with what he said. It's not consistent with what the Federal Reserve did during this period, which I actually argue that during this period \u8211\'20\'13 the issue of the 2003 to 2005 period is a tough one. I happen to agree with you that monetary policy was too easy, and I disagree with Ben on that point when he countered your arguments. I don't think, however, that that's the main reason we had the disaster we had. If you've studied financial crises, which is \u8211\'20\'13 and the history of financial crises, this is a classic; that basically, there was a set of events that occurred \u8211\'20\'13 new technologies \u8211\'20\'13 this is typical of the way you get financial crises \u8211\'20\'13 new technologies, there was an unawareness of how these technologies could be a problem both in the private sector and by regulators, and in that sense the regulators can be blamed. And then it blew up in a disastrous way and brought bad outcomes. And in that sense, I do agree with Ben. But I actually don't defend \u8211\'20\'13 I was unhappy that he defended monetary policy which was, in fact, too easy beforehand.\par \par \uc2 So I think that, from my perspective, that we better be very careful in terms of terms. And I think the same issue comes up in terms of this format. There's subtleties involved.\par \par \uc2 The way you've described it actually today I had much less problems with. But I think the reality that we have to understand \u8211\'20\'13 and, in fact, the issue of accountability and the need to actually talk about how you set policy instruments in terms of achieving the dual mandate is actually critical in terms of good monetary policy. There are subtleties here in terms of the Act which I really worry about tremendously, in particular that the Congress has this tendency to talk about flip-flopping all the time. Don mentioned this. I think he's absolutely right. Think about what happened if the format was in place when the Fed had to clearly deviate very strongly from Taylor rules. And, in fact, I would argue that's exactly one of the reasons why we shouldn't have rules as something that we have to follow, even if they're used as guidance. It would admit that the Fed would have been doing something very different, and I can tell you the constraints on the Fed from the political process would have been even worse.\par \par \uc2 So these are issues that we're going to debate over the next bunch of days. And so I think that there's a lot of subtlety here. But I think we have to be very careful in terms of our terms. Constrained discretion, Ben Bernanke was not somebody who was a pure discretion guy. By the way, I happen to agree with you on \uc2 Larry Summers\uc2 . Larry is somebody who is a pure discretion guy. And, by the way, at the Federal Reserve, (former Treasury Secretary) Tim Geithner and I had a lot of fighters before the crisis where I was arguing for constrained discretion, more rule-like behavior, and he was not keen on it. But I think that the case of the actual way the Fed acted and the way Ben Bernanke acted, it's actually completely incorrect to say that he was somebody who was advocating discretion and not being accountable to have a strategy and be very clear about the strategy.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: Go ahead. (Inaudible.)\par \par \uc2 KAPLAN: OK. And this will build a little bit on the previous comment.\par \par \uc2 First of all, I think it was a great discussion, and I particularly agree with some of \uc2 Don Kohn\uc2 's recommendations at the end, which sound like there may be a consensus on. The one comment we'll probably build on (inaudible), it probably makes sense that '03 to '05 there were \u8211\'20\'13 may have been monetary policy mistakes. For someone who was in the markets at a firm \u8211\'20\'13 at a firm at that point, I wonder, though, for the Fed whether the bigger lesson \u8211\'20\'13 I guess we'll get your reaction in the Q&A \u8211\'20\'13 the bigger lesson is on macroprudential policy. And I think that's an important thing for us to think about today. In particular, growth in leverage in the financial system, and particularly the explosion in (credit default swaps), which would have been caught with strong, rigorous stress testing, which we do in fact have today. And some legislation is \u8211\'20\'13 wants to dilute that to some extent. I wonder if that's the bigger lesson from '03-'05, and so I'll be curious to hear your reaction to that.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you both for really excellent, excellent comments.\par \par \uc2 I guess my question is to learn a little bit more on the issue of international versus domestic as the driver. In our very global world, where spillovers tend to come from all kinds of direction(s), looking at current policy and how it's being determined by current domestic inputs, where the future might be impacted quite substantially if a big trading partner or bloc has a problem, how does that get put into a model versus discretion?\par \par \uc2 And the related part would be, then, something that was just mentioned in terms of financial spillovers. It's very, very \u8211\'20\'13 so I come from a private-sector background, and I think one of the things that I am particularly keen to hear about is really the financial-sector spillovers that are often not visible right away in the economy but, as we have seen with the large debt that we have across much of the developed world, does show up in very substantial ways down the path. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: Charles?\par \par \uc2 Q: Sure. Charles Lieberman, Advisors Capital Management.\par \par \uc2 One of the underlying problems here, I think, is the interaction between politics and economics. Congress would like to impose accountability on the Federal Reserve, and that requires rules. Without rules, there can be no accountability. And yet, John Taylor sort of straddles the line between rules and discretion because he recognizes that you can't impose some rules without some discretion. And yet, of course, that wouldn't be convenient for Congress. It's typical of politicians that they want to impose rules, and often those rules are very simplistic. A good example: Dodd-Frank, where Congress tried to impose rules, couldn't even figure out how to implement them, so they passed the problem along to the various agencies. And I think they would discover again, if they impose any version of the Taylor rule, that they would run into problems and have to allow discretion.\par \par \uc2 Q: V.V. Chari, \uc2 University of Minnesota\uc2  and \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I'll try to keep this short. The substantive point made and a linguistic point I think is actually important. That sounds minor. Let me start with the substantive point.\par \par \uc2 I think everybody is right. John emphasized this, and he's exactly right about this: You cannot think about policy as anything other than a strategy, which is a contingent plan of how you are going to choose policy in various situations you might find yourself. There are two important aspects of strategy which are often confused in the way people think about it. One is strategy is my contingent plan for what I will do. And the second is a strategy is also other people's beliefs about what my contingency plan is. And both of them are important in any dynamic or any interesting situation.\par \par \uc2 Let me \u8211\'20\'13 let me explain. There's a great scene from "Dr. Strangelove" where the United States has built a doomsday machine which is going to go off if the Russians attack. Unfortunately, they've chosen \u8211\'20\'13 that's a strategy \u8211\'20\'13 they've chosen to keep that secret from the Russians. (Laughter.) And Dr. Strangelove says, what sort of idiots are you? The whole point of building the doomsday machine is to tell the other people you've got the doomsday machine!\par \par \uc2 So once you think about things that way, it's not particularly important whether the FOMC gathers together and looks at its particular rule and says, oh, are we deviating, are we not deviating. What is critically important is that market participants and private agents and firms and households and everybody else have consistent, sensible beliefs about how you are going to act in the future. And so that is what is going to help.\par \par \uc2 The relevant question that in \uc2 Don Kohn\uc2  \u8211\'20\'13 the survey that \uc2 Don Kohn\uc2  quoted is not do you think the Fed \u8211\'20\'13 do you think you understand the Fed's reaction function. The relevant question is: Do you all agree on what the Fed's reaction function is? The proposal at hand, which John has been pushing, I understand it, is to try and reconcile those two notions of strategy. Forget about legislation. Think about a different framework for how the Federal Open Market Committee should make its decisions.\par \par \uc2 Let's say every three to five years they get together and they choose a strategy: This is how we are going to react in the future in various contingencies. Obviously, you're not going to label every contingency. That's too many pages for anybody to read. You're going to label the important contingencies. That's what you're going to do. Then you \u8211\'20\'13 whenever you deviate from it \u8211\'20\'13 and you will deviate from it \u8211\'20\'13 you have an obligation to explain what you're doing.\par \par \uc2 What is the advantage of doing all this? The whole point of doing all this is you communicate to the public at large this is how I am going to behave in the future. Right now we've got a whole bunch of really smart people out there in the FOMC, right? Ask anybody in the market \u8211\'20\'13 ask any five people in the market, how do you think they're going to respond to five different \u8211\'20\'13 to a couple of different circumstances in the future? I'm willing to put a solid amount of money on the proposition that you are not going to get any agreement at all. That is the world we are currently living in, where I have no idea \u8211\'20\'13 or, at least, I have ideas. But my ideas don't agree with the other guy's idea on what they're going to do in the future. So the whole point of this proposal is to enable people to coordinate on how they think the Fed will behave in the future.\par \par \uc2 I just don't see how anybody could object at a conceptual level to a straightforward proposal like that. It shifts all the discussion at the FOMC away from silly ideas about should I go up 25 basis points, should I go down 25 basis points, should I stay where I am. What nonsense is this? Because we have no way of using economics to understand that. To a much more focused strategic conversation, which says: How are we going to react in the future? What are we going to communicate about how we're going to react in the future to changes in circumstances, to changes and shocks? That enables private agents to coordinate on what \u8211\'20\'13 coordinate their beliefs.\par \par \uc2 I think overall, that kind of framework is likely to lead to much better outcomes. That's what I see, what it is. Reducing the debate to simple notions of should I should I follow the Taylor rule with a coefficient of 0.5 misses the whole point of changing the framework of this country. As far as the minor linguistic point is concerned, even under discretion, the people are going to be believed to be following certain rules. So the discussion is not between rules and discretion. I think (Finn) Kydland and (Edward) Prescott chose the wrong title for their very important and influential paper. I think the real question is one \u8211\'20\'13 is the distinction between commitment and no commitment.\par \par \uc2 Commitment says I choose a strategy and I tell you what strategy I'm going to follow in the future, and I will not deviate from that strategy. Discretion says I'm going to choose a rule which is optimal at each date. That is the difference that I think we should keep in mind. Sorry for having gone on so long.\par \par \uc2 MR. KOHN: So very briefly, very important comments. I would like to respond to everything, but the comment from \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 I agree that the forecast is in principle better, if you can forecast well. And what I learned a lot from your colleague over to your left was that the rules are very helpful for inflation targeting connects. And that's, in a sense, how they can implement it. So it's kind of a different approach to rules. And I tend to be worrisome about it, because forecasts are not all that great. And, second, if you have a forecast, is forecast based, the rules are going to be a little different than if you don't.\par \par \uc2 So that's \u8211\'20\'13 I think (inaudible) points about the model bias I think are very interesting. In some sense, I think that's why the simple rules worked in the models. I completely agree. There's some important things in the models. Now, there is a lot of work with \u8211\'20\'13 different kinds of models don't have that property and they seem to work well. And maybe the world will be different in the future.\par \par \uc2 MR. TAYLOR: So, (inaudible) and I have discussed this constraint, discretion issue many times. And I maybe over-characterized it. I think there is a difference, which is worthwhile going into. And I think the forecast targeting is more specific about this than pure constraint, discretion. So I agree with Rob very much about the other issues that occurred in 2003, '4, and '5. I sometimes say that there were kind of two rules broken.\par \par \uc2 One was the regulatory rules \u8211\'20\'13 a lot of things going on at the financial institutions that probably should have \u8211\'20\'13 if we had some policies we could have dealt with, probably should have dealt with them in any case. International spillovers is a big interest of mine now. I've written about it as much as much as I can. I'm seeing impacts on exchange rates that I think people were not aware of, and maybe not understand that, because it is part of the international spillover, which is \u8211\'20\'13 which is very important.\par \par \uc2 So just on Jerry's points, I agree about the fact that this \u8211\'20\'13 you want the strategy to be understood by others. That's a very big part of this. And whether Don's surveys addressed that or not I don't know. So I'll just pass it to him.\par \par \uc2 MR. KOHN: So I don't \u8211\'20\'13 I don't think they asked did you all agree on the strategy. But let me make just two points here, or cover two topics. One is the 2003, '05. And I think, like Rob, I think the regulatory breakdown was much more important than excessive reliance on the private sector to manage \u8211\'20\'13 or, to understand and manage the real risks and complacence on the part of both the private sector and the regulators that they were doing a good job. And encapsulated, in some sense, in Basel II, which said: You guys know how to manage your risk. We're going to rely on your risk \u8211\'20\'13 your risk models, which were totally \u8211\'20\'13 ended up being totally inadequate.\par \par \uc2 On the level of interest rates \u8211\'20\'13 I litigated this a few years ago at a conference \u8211\'20\'13 I think there are reasons why the interest rates at most were only a little too low. We were \u8211\'20\'13 depends on which price index you're looking at. There were changes in financial conditions that affected what the appropriate interest rate was. So I think the regulation's much more important. But on the interest rates, the thing I regret, John, is that \u8211\'20\'13 is the measured pace language. So, it wasn't so much the level of rates. It was the predictability of the rates. And I think when we started that language in 2004, we didn't \u8211\'20\'13 we didn't mean it's going to be a quarter point each meeting, but that's what it ended up meaning.\par \par \uc2 And we got into that thing. And perhaps we didn't \u8211\'20\'13 and, frankly, (former Boston Fed president) Cathy Minehan was one of the people who pointed out at FOMC meetings: There's too much certainty out there. People are doing carry trades. They're counting on this. And they're building up positions that they're going to regret. So I think of the policy \u8211\'20\'13 of the monetary policy mistakes we made, the communication mistakes we made, I think was being too predictable rather than being too low and not responding to changing conditions.\par \par \uc2 And then on (inaudible) points, one problem is anticipating what's going to happen. So there are so many possible things that could happen. Letting people know how you'd respond to this, that, and the other thing is going to be very, very hard. But I do \u8211\'20\'13 there are some \u8211\'20\'13 and I think the FOMC is trying to say over the last few years how it might respond to inflation coming in a little faster, a little slower, how it might respond to unemployment. They have the threshold thing on the zero.\par \par \uc2 So I think they've tried to do that. I do think talking about why your interest rate is where it is and the things you considered in getting to that point relevant to, say, some rules, or relevant to, say, previous expectations, will help people understand how you're going to react to contingencies. You can't always \u8211\'20\'13 and, as I said, rules \u8211\'20\'13 you can have a strategy without following the rule. But you should be following some principles that help people know how you're going to react to unexpected developments. And I think any central bank can always improve on how to enunciate that principles \u8211\'20\'13 those principles and how that \u8211\'20\'13 those principles got them to where they are.\par \par \uc2 MR. TAYLOR: OK. So one quick reaction about \u8211\'20\'13 the communications in 2004 and '5, mainly, a little bit in '3, I agree with you. It's not just the low rates. It's the commitment to low rates for a while. And in fact this convinces me \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. KOHN: It's not so much \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 MR. TAYLOR: Yeah, exactly. It was the measured pace, absolutely. But it's a little more than the uncertainty. It's the certainty it's going to be low. You know, it's not just the predictability. It's not \u8211\'20\'13 that the low rates and the statement they would be low for a while together. I completely agree, that was part of the problem.\par \par \uc2 MODERATOR: OK. So we'll now take a break.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Transcript: Panel Discussion With BOE's Haldane, ECB's Coeur\u233\'00\'E9\par \par \uc2 Bank of England Chief Economist Andrew Haldane gave a presentation that was followed by a panel discussion with Princeton University professor Markus Brunnermeier, European Central Bank executive board member Beno\u238\'00\'EEt Coeur\u233\'00\'E9, Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy senior fellow Nellie Liang, and Harvard University professor Jeremy Stein, during a Peterson Institute for International Economics conference on "Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy" in Washington on Thursday, Oct. 12, 2017. Peterson Institute President Adam S. Posen served as moderator. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity.\par \par \uc2 ADAM S. POSEN: I look at this panel and I'm awed by its intellect and its real-world relevance. And then I worry these are too many insiders. So let's see where this discussion goes.\par \par \uc2 Let me turn first to Markus Brunnermeier of Princeton University.\par \par \uc2 MARKUS BRUNNERMEIER: Thanks a lot for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be here. It's always hard to follow up on [Bank of England Chief Economist] Andy [Haldane], because I don't have a Frisbee and I didn't bring a dog either.\par \par \uc2 So I recommend highly to read this piece of work Andy wrote with his co-authors, which covers a lot of ground. It's very detailed and it goes \u8211\'20\'13 it's very comprehensive on what happened in the regulatory framework. And it also goes into macro models, to what extent we can use these macro models to calibrate, you know, what capital requirements we need and all the other dimensions Andy mentioned.\par \par \uc2 So rather than going over the whole thing, because it covers too much, in my eight minutes I will just highlight five different points I think where there were shifts in our thinking in the last few years how to deal with that.\par \par \uc2 The first thing I would say, within the macro models, is a shift away from thinking about stocks and flows to think much more about the risk focus. And I will mention this paradox of prudence compared to a paradox of thrift later on.\par \par \uc2 The second dimension I would like to mention is the focus before the crisis was very much on the risk of a financial institution on its own and the risk in isolation, focusing much more on the spillovers, the externalities an institution can cause onto the system. That was a fundamental shift how you measure risk and how you capture risk.\par \par \uc2 And the third dimension is more in the time dimension, where it's essentially saying if you measure volatility, current volatility, it's very low. That's actually not a sign that the system is healthy. It might be a sign that there's some risk building up in the background. OK, so that's what [Peterson Institute senior fellow] Olivier [Blanchard] mentioned early on. So it can be very misleading if current volatility measures are very low. That's the volatility paradox.\par \par \uc2 The fourth dimension I would like to mention is the separation principle we saw before the crisis all over the place. You put things in little boxes and you treat them in the box separately. And we saw that actually many of these things, in particular prudential policy, which is now macroprudential, is very closely tied to monetary policy. And monetary policy has a lot to do also with shifting wealth around and recapitalizing certain sectors.\par \par \uc2 And finally, I would like to contrast some stability focus and contrast it with some resiliency dimension.\par \par \uc2 OK, let me focus on the first one. The first one is shifting from a focus on stocks and flows to much more focusing on the risk dimension. What I mean by the risk dimension, of course, we always have models where there's some uncertainty and risk in it. But to focus on the volatility dynamics itself, rather than have a one-time shock and then you see how the impulse response is and how you go back, you focus on the whole volatility dynamics, how the volatility would play out. If you have a one-time shock, is the volatility going up further or further down? What's the whole volatility dynamics?\par \par \uc2 I think this is very important to focus on these high-water moments because it then also feeds back in precautionary savings and consumption behavior and so forth. And also, one aspect which played out very prominently in the crisis was this flight to safety, flight into safe assets, and the role of safe assets, which became way more prominent in the crisis, and in the research has enlarged and has \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 in the optimal regulatory framework.\par \par \uc2 Let me contrast this just with two paradoxes. And Andy mentioned this in the paper, this fallacy of composition, which is very, very important. You should not consider something which is true in the microsphere is also true in the macro sphere. And there's the famous Keynes paradox of thrift. If everybody is more thrifty, spends less \u8211\'20\'13 your spending is my income, essentially \u8211\'20\'13 then my income is going down. And if everybody lowers their marginal propensity to consume, actually, at the end of the day, I try to save more, but in dollar terms actually I might actually save less, because the economy contracts because of that.\par \par \uc2 You can do a similar thing \u8211\'20\'13 and Yuliy and I, we're pushing this term, "paradox of prudence." When you try to be more prudent instead of cutting back your spending, you actually cut back on your risk-taking, so you're more \u8211\'20\'13 less risk-taking. Actually, this increases endogenous risk in the system. So everybody tries to take on less risk, but by doing so, actually endogenously the risk in the system is going up.\par \par \uc2 So what's micro-prudent is actually not macro prudent, because by being more prudent on your own, on your microsphere, and banking regulation is imposing it on you, then actually you create more risk in the macro sphere, and that actually makes the whole system much more volatile. And actually, that's very counterproductive.\par \par \uc2 So the same thing you can do in the stock-and-flow basis on the Keynes consumption-savings decision, you can also do it in portfolio choice decision on the risks base as well. So that's the first, this movement away from, you know, impulse response functions. One-time shock and have an impulse response, much more to overall analysis of the whole volatility dynamics, how the volatility dynamics is playing out.\par \par \uc2 The second aspect I would like to mention is \u8211\'20\'13 which is not in a time dimension; it's much more in the cross-section \u8211\'20\'13 is a focus away from the riskiness of a financial institution. How likely is it that the financial institution is going under? But the riskiness of a financial institution being in difficulties causes on the whole system. What are the spillovers? What are the externalities in terms of risk on the system?\par \par \uc2 And these spillovers come in two flavors. One of the spillovers are direct contractual links. So if we have some contractual connections, there's a whole network structure you can actually figure out how the bankruptcy of one bank causes a bankruptcy for the next bank, and so forth. And this is the first network domino-effect type of spillovers.\par \par \uc2 And then there are, of course, the indirect ones, which turn out to be way more powerful than the direct ones. That's through some liquidity spirals through common exposure to similar assets, so there will be some \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 asset prices going down, and that drags down others as well. And that can, again, come in the level space, where the asset price is going down. It can also come in the volatility space, where the asset price become more volatile, hence the margins are actually going up. And that's why it forces people to de-lever. So the value at risk is going up, people have to de-lever. And this actually feeds on its own, makes the situation even worse.\par \par \uc2 And what's a fundamental difference between the first one and the second one, the first one you can characterize very nicely, because you know when a bank goes bankrupt, then it will cause some direct spillover effects. The second one depends on the behavioral response of the particular player in the marketplace. So you have to figure out what is the behavioral response on that. Measuring this behavioral response is way more difficult. And then the outcome is a general-equilibrium outcome, which has a lot of feedback effects and amplification going on.\par \par \uc2 So what one needs essentially is some response indicators. So we have to collect data, not about positions or something, but on something on the funding conditions, combined with the market liquidity of these positions, which indicates will this particular player be a shock absorber or will it be a shock amplifier. So essentially you can classify things. If you have these response indicators, you can then say, oh, this institution, it's more likely to \u8211\'20\'13 when there's a negative shock, it will actually contribute to the shock and will amplify the shock. And the other institution is \u8211\'20\'13 you know, the price is going down, it sees it as a good buying opportunity, is actually providing liquidity, it will be a shock absorber. So to classify these institutions in different ways.\par \par \uc2 And you can liken the domino effects. You can build up a network with virtual links, which, because they're not contractually linked directly, they will be virtual links, but you can say some of them are shock amplifiers and some of them are shock absorbers. It depends where in the network they are placed how stable the whole network is at the end of the day.\par \par \uc2 So that was a second dimension.\par \par \uc2 The third dimension is, again, the volatility paradox, where essentially if you measure contemporaneous risk with the value at risk or some volatility measure, it can be very misleading. Right now all the volatility measures are very, very down. That actually can be very misleading, because this leads to lower margins, as I mentioned earlier; leads to higher margin debt, higher leverage. And that makes you vulnerable to some more risk down the road.\par \par \uc2 And then, when there is a shock and the vulnerable are shocked, then actually the value at risk is shooting up, and then you suddenly have this huge adjustment and the whole thing goes into reverse. You have this risk-on, risk-off phenomena playing out. So you have this huge pro-cyclicality. And the paper talks at length how the countercyclical buffer helps to overcome this pro-cyclicality. The old Basel II framework essentially was very dangerous in this regard because, you know, the risk weights were, to some extent, very much related to the value at risk, and having this countercyclical buffer is actually helping on this dimension.\par \par \uc2 On a more subtle note, you can show in models that actually if you have a financial system which can better ensure idiosyncratic risk, endogenous risk of the system is actually higher. So actually going from a very incomplete market setting to a less incomplete market setting, you make the whole system less stable because, essentially, if you insure people's idiosyncratic risk, they will take on more leverage to bet more along the aggregate-risk dimension, and that makes the whole system more risky.\par \par \uc2 So these are all complications which we have learned during the last \u8211\'20\'13 and the paper touches upon them. That makes calibrating macro models or finding the right macro models challenging, because whether you put this mechanism in or not affects very much your calibration of capital requirements.\par \par \uc2 So let me just illustrate this buildup that is just a little \u8211\'20\'13 craft a buildup of this risk in the background. Oh, two minutes, OK.\par \par \uc2 So the buildup of the background. So if that's just a best response function, as a function of what the others are doing. And when the risk is building up in the background, nothing happens, you have this equilibrium up there. This is that dot. And it's all \u8211\'20\'13 only what happens is actually the best response changes, but you don't see the best response because it's off equilibrium. But now if there is \u8211\'20\'13 a shock occurs, then actually you move down dramatically because there was first amplification. And later \u8211\'20\'13 I mean, there's also multiplicity in this particular example. We can jump to a much lower equilibrium as well. So the high nonlinearity is showing up.\par \par \uc2 The fourth dimension I would like to mention is that macropru and monetary policy are highly connected. I think there is a tendency to have separation principles everywhere and have little boxes to put this together. Why is this so highly connected? If you look at emerging economies, it's also the case that you don't want those. Macropru now in the advanced economies is actually part of their monetary policy toolbox in emerging economies. Of course, they are connected also because most of the money is created by the banking sector. So inside money is created by the banking sector. And we know that, you know, in downturns the banking sector shrinks and the banking sector will not take out so much idiosyncratic risk. More of this risk is then held by the households, so money demand goes up. So just replacing the missing inside money with new outside money, that's what the monetary risks would do in order to keep the total money supply constant is actually not enough, because inside money and outside money are not substitute from a social perspective.\par \par \uc2 And that's something where we have to be very aware of, that these two things are not separate from each other. They interact and, hence, we need coordination, as came up many times before, but in fiscal and monetary. But we also need it between these two authorities or these two branches of stabilization of the macro economy.\par \par \uc2 And then there's, of course, the whole balance sheet of a central bank is highly interlinked with all bank regulation. At the moment, why are the banks holding so much of the short-term claims? It's, of course, because liquidity regulation makes it \u8211\'20\'13 forces them, essentially, to hold these excess reserves from the central bank. So this interacts very strongly with the central bank, and has implications how big the central bank's balance sheet should be in this regard. Let me just say \u8211\'20\'13 and then, of course, it is the case that it is \u8211\'20\'13 recapitalizing monetary policy is affecting stealth recapitalization. There are more income effects rather than substitution effects playing out.\par \par \uc2 Let me, finally, say something about volatility and resiliency. I think there are two ways you can measure stability. One is just looking at the volatility, which is just having a concrete wall, essentially, is that I don't want to be there, and it's more about the standard deviation of variance. The other thing is resiliency, where it's more a rubber wall. So there is a \u8211\'20\'13 you know, there's a shock, you give in at the time on the shock, but then actually there's stronger mean reversion along this. And I think we should focus more on the resiliency component rather than on purely measuring the volatility. If you have a resiliency aspect to it, we can have sometimes facing a bigger shock, as long as we are coming back. This is actually an easier way to deal with a certain situation.\par \par \uc2 I'm running out of time, so it's \u8211\'20\'13 let me jump over that.\par \par \uc2 And let me just summarize briefly. Again, I think what happened in the last 10 years, away from an impulse response, stock floor analysis; more to a volatility dynamics risk focus, from risk in isolation for an institution to the spillovers from systemic \u8211\'20\'13 to systemic risk measures; away from measuring just contemporaneous risk at this point in time \u8211\'20\'13 which is very misleading \u8211\'20\'13 towards analyzing hidden risk, which might suddenly appear when the crisis materializes; and then to be aware that it's not so simple just putting things in separate boxes. The separation principles we have to be very careful about because everything in a crisis tends to be interlinked. And finally, I think there should be a focus more on resiliency on top of purely volatility measures.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Thank you very much, Markus.\par \par \uc2 Let me turn now to Beno\u238\'00\'EEt Coeur\u233\'00\'E9 of the European Central Bank.\par \par \uc2 BENO\u206\'00\'CET COEUR\u201\'00\'C9: So good evening. It's very difficult to pay justice to all dimensions of Andy's paper because there's even much more to it than what Andy actually said here. So we could spend a whole week assessing it, which is probably not what you want to do tonight. So I will \u8211\'20\'13 I will try to be focused. And let me start by saying right first that paper is very timely. It comes at a time where the regulatory community want to take a step side and look back and what has been achieved since Pittsburgh, and review and evaluate. And the FSB [Financial Stability Board] will have this big evaluation project which is starting. So the paper I think is very helpful to put a little bit of an analytical structure on it, which we are not very good at doing. So it's good that you're doing it.\par \par \uc2 And second, I agree with most of the conclusions. So I will be very focused. I agree that the ever-higher capital requirements haven't led to lower lending. So that lends some credit to the assumption that capital requirements could have been calibrated at a higher level. Notwithstanding the TLAC [total loss-absorbing capacity], which you mentioned, which add a little bit of complexity. Also notwithstanding the fact that it could look different in an environment with higher rates, generally. So the kind of \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 distortion that capital requirements introduce are very benign today, but they could look different in an environment where the \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 structure would be \u8211\'20\'13 would be wider. So that's an open question.\par \par \uc2 And I also agree with the conclusion that different roles are complementary, and that the \u8211\'20\'13 what you call the multipolar regulatory regime, which I would call silo-based, is probably what we need when we know so little about these consequences of the difference \u8211\'20\'13 of the different roles. So this I agree.\par \par \uc2 So let me focus on two issues. First one is about regulatory spillovers and the \u8211\'20\'13 precisely this silo-based approach, or the multipolar approach to regulation. And the second one is something which you've not developed too much, which is about financial structures. And I will make the hypothesis that financial structures are to some extent endogenous to the way we do regulation, and that's something that we \u8211\'20\'13 we're not very good at looking through.\par \par \uc2 So the first point is on the tradeoffs which are involved in multipolar regulation. And again, I agree with the main conclusion of the paper that it's probably right to have these regulatory systems being over-constrained when we look banking regulation. But the point is that everything that we've done since Pittsburgh has created a financial system which is much more diverse than it was 10 years ago, both in the way risk is being intermediated \u8211\'20\'13 and that's about nonbanks rising and doing risk transformation the same way as banks do. And that's also about the way risk is being processed, pooled, and redistributed. And that's in particular about the rise of CCPs [central counterparties] as engines of risk transformation. And that was not the case 10 years ago.\par \par \uc2 And when you move to a system which is very much focused on banks, to a system which is \u8211\'20\'13 which has a more diverse set of actors, the risk is that regulatory spillovers can be more likely and can be also more difficult to identify. So just to give you an example which is an issue I've been \u8211\'20\'13 I've been spending some time on, which is the interaction between bank regulation and CCP regulation. And more practically, the interaction between the delivered ratio and the clearing mandates. ... You have clearing clients depositing margins with CCPs. These margins are accounted for in the leveraged ratio. So the leveraged ratio is non-risk-based, as it should. But the mere fact that it does include the initial margin and the variation margin creates a disincentive to central clearing.\par \par \uc2 So here you have a tradeoff. And it's not that clear where we're standing \u8211\'20\'13 on which side of the tradeoff we're standing. That's something we have to look deeper into. But we have a clear tradeoff which did not exist before the reform started. And that could be many more examples of it. So that's the kind of issues we will have to look in more depth. And by the way, the FSB will do it \u8211\'20\'13 will have the review of incentives to central clearing, under the barbaric acronym of DAT, Derivatives Assessment Team. So when you hear about the DAT, that will be about whether the ratio is rightly calibrated or not rightly calibrated. But that's an example.\par \par \uc2 And I don't think that \u8211\'20\'13 it's very difficult for us to address for us, because if you would like to characterize these kind of tradeoffs you will need first to define the loss function between the social value of central clearing and social value of higher capital \u8211\'20\'13 higher leveraged ratio, for that matter. How would you define the loss function? How would you put rates on the different objectives? And then you would need a model which is granular enough to have CCPs and banks and the kind of interactions between CCPs and banks. And we don't have it. And we're still a long way from having it. So it's very difficult to put numbers on these kind of discussions.\par \par \uc2 And one other example, which is pretty obvious is international spillovers. And coming back to CCPs, again, now that CCPs are big, super-systemic infrastructures, we need \u8211\'20\'13 we need to be serious about cooperative oversight of CCPs. And we still have some way to go before we have proper \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 oversights for large CCPs. So that's also an example of a regulatory spillover which did not exist some years ago, which is the \u8211\'20\'13 in a sense, the outcome of what we've, ourselves, created since Pittsburgh. And the European proposal to have a new third-party regime for CCPs is an attempt at dealing with it by providing instruments to properly supervise risks being created outside of the EU. It is controversial, but it is one attempt to deal at this kind of spillover that weren't there some years ago.\par \par \uc2 My second \u8211\'20\'13 my second point is on financial structures. And it's more difficult, in a sense, because I'm not sure that you've properly accounted for the fact that our own supervisory or regulatory decisions, also regulatory stance, can have an impact on financial structures, which can work through either some forms of financing receiving preferential treatment, or by protecting incumbents from competition, which are two ways where this kind of an impact on the financial mix. So in a sense, regulatory decisions or regulatory framework has allocative consequences for the way the financial system works.\par \par \uc2 And regulators are really caught between a rock and hard place. You can't ignore the effects of regulation on the financial system, because that would be \u8211\'20\'13 that would be delusional. It has an impact on the financial system. At the same time, if you want to internalize too much the impact of regulation on the financial system, you run the risk of moving from a prudential mandate to an industrial mandate, which is, I believe, a deadly sin for a regulator. And not everyone will agree, but I think that that create a huge risk of confusion in mandates and instruments.\par \par \uc2 And for long, the academic research hasn't been very helpful because it has more or less considered the different financial structures were equivalent, from an allocative standpoint, but it's no longer the case. So we now know that moving from \u8211\'20\'13 say, from a bond-based system to a market-based system is helpful when you move closer to the technological fronts here. That's what we are trying to achieve in Europe with the Capital Markets Union. So the \u8211\'20\'13 also the kind of academic evidence that we have here has changed. And that comes at a time where banks themselves are challenged by technological shifts. And you mentioned fintech, which is an obvious challenge to the \u8211\'20\'13 to the future and the profitability of banks.\par \par \uc2 So the \u8211\'20\'13 so one question we have here is how much should regulators care about it? And I see two scenarios for the future. One scenario is one where banks will rise to the challenge. And they will \u8211\'20\'13 they will internalize all the technological change. They will join forces with start-ups, et cetera. And that outcome would probably be benign from a regulatory standpoint, because we know how to regulate banks. So it doesn't change much to the landscape. But it \u8211\'20\'13 there are crucial assumptions. First, it assumes that banks will be profitable enough to be able to invest in that kind of new activities. So in Europe, that would mean that they have to cut costs and they have to address NPLs [nonperforming loans] in a more forceful way to be able to do it.\par \par \uc2 And it may create different challenges for regulators. For instance, if we want to let banks reap the benefits of economies of scale, which are inherent to new technologies, while not recreating the risk of "too big to fail." And that's something that is still ahead of us, in a sense. How much do we want to let banks look more like Apple and Google, without recreating "too big to fail"? I don't think we have a proper answer to that.\par \par \uc2 So the last remark, and I'm done, is that this is not only about regulation. It's also \u8211\'20\'13 it's not only a challenge for regulators. It's also a challenge for central banks. And I would argue that to some extent, as much as financial structure are to some extent endogenous to regulation, they are also endogenous to the way we do monetary policy. And Markus made the point minutes ago that the size and composition of central bank balance sheets has an impact on financial intermediation, and I'm quite sure that Jeremy also will make that point. So we have to be mindful about the impact of our own decisions on the future of financial structures.\par \par \uc2 And there are a number of examples. Negative rates are an example. So, so far we are very comfortable with the conclusion that negative rates haven't harmed financial intermediation, and that the general equilibrium impact of negative rates and the other monetary policy instruments have dominated by far any negative impact on bond profitability. But that could change over time, so that's something we have to \u8211\'20\'13 we have to monitor.\par \par \uc2 Same for QE [quantitative easing]. It's very hard to believe that central banks keeping very large balance sheets for a considerable amount of time will not have an impact on financial intermediation.\par \par \uc2 So what I'm \u8211\'20\'13 the point I'm making here is, is essence, the opposite of the points Jeremy has made, which is that you may want central banks to have large balance sheets, because if you believe that commercial banks are not doing it the right way or that you can \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 created by liquidity creation in the commercial banking system are too \u8211\'20\'13 are too harmful to society and are not addressed by regulation. I am making the opposite point, that if for monetary policy reasons we keep a very, very large balance sheet for a very long amount of time, you may crowd out financial intermediation in a way that can spill back into monetary policy.\par \par \uc2 So I am not arguing that central banks should have a different mandate. We have a price stability mandate, so that matters only to the extent that it spills back into monetary policy or that it would have an impact on monetary policy transmission. But the longer it lasts, the more likely this is going to happen.\par \par \uc2 And I stop here, Adam.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Thank you, Beno\u238\'00\'EEt.\par \par \uc2 Nellie Liang of the Brookings Institution.\par \par \uc2 NELLIE LIANG: OK. So thank you very much for inviting me to be here.\par \par \uc2 I do recommend that you all take a look at \u8211\'20\'13 I'm going to go back, OK \u8211\'20\'13 to read Andy Haldane's paper. It's actually \u8211\'20\'13 it's very nice, it's a very comprehensive review of the state of financial stability policy and research. And it is a very convenient time for a stock take.\par \par \uc2 I'm not going to \u8211\'20\'13 he mentions also multiple areas for further research. And I'm going to sort of take up two of these. And the two are models of how the financial sector interacts and affects the real economy and, second, the governance structures for macroprudential policies, which are actually very important for taking actions.\par \par \uc2 And you should take my comments today in the spirit of work in progress, next steps in financial stability.\par \par \uc2 Let's see. So first, on the models, let me just say Andy points out that the Bank of England as early as 2009, where macroprudential policy was sort of still just a word that wasn't well known and repeated, raised the questions of what are the objectives. Should it be the resilience of large institutions and markets, or should it be the credit cycles, trying to smooth credit cycles of households and businesses?\par \par \uc2 So, for economists, there's arguments for both lenders and borrowers, creditors and debtors, since there are negative externalities associated with each if either of them become stressed. So then you get a bunch of different kinds of tools. You can have capital requirements, like the CCYB [countercyclical capital buffer], or you can have LTVs [loan-to-value ratios] for the lenders. But there's a whole bunch of different tools.\par \par \uc2 And then there are arguments for structural versus dynamic. And I guess I would make one point on the dynamic policies. There are important reasons to consider dynamic policies and not just think about structural. One, risk-taking appears to be pro-cyclical. Two, regulations appear to be pro-cyclical and regulations can be arbitraged. And in the U.S. in a very market-based economy, this is not an abstract concern.\par \par \uc2 But I am very sympathetic to implementation. It's not easy. We don't have reaction functions. We have multiple tools, we have multiple targets. You know, we don't even know what the arguments in a reaction function are. So in this vein I'm going to mention a couple of things that are ongoing.\par \par \uc2 Again, recent developmental-stage work in this, which try to develop measures that express financial stability risks in terms of risks to output or real activity. And I'm going to mention just three exercises.\par \par \uc2 So this first one is just an illustration. It's a VAR [value at risk], but it's a threshold VAR, so we're going to allow for some nonlinearities. We talked this morning about VARs. And it looks at whether the effects of financial conditions on economic growth vary with macro financial imbalances. In this case, like, private, nonfinancial credit and we use a credit gap here. So you define \u8211\'20\'13 and excess credit gap has been used or a credit gap or excess credit, some measures, have been used by many countries in helping them thinking about implementing the CCYB, or the counter-cyclical capital buffer.\par \par \uc2 So this is a threshold VAR based on U.S. data, 1975 to 2014. And the idea is to see if the effects of financial conditions on the economy vary by whether you've got a high credit gap or a low credit gap. And just think financial conditions here. Don't think too technically if they're sort of indictors of financial stability risks.\par \par \uc2 And what this shows is, like \u8211\'20\'13 and we use red lines and blue lines. And so in red-line periods, that's high credit. So you shock financial conditions and you find that looser financial conditions, a shock to it is loose, is going to boost GDP [gross domestic product] in the near-term quarters and it's going to be a little bit higher in a high-credit period, and then in the blue, which is the low credit.\par \par \uc2 But then you can see it's, like, it falls, growth declines, you have a recession. It's just basically less sustainable. So this allows sort of for these nonlinear effects. There's some work here that looks at robustness, that this high credit is not approximating for other factors.\par \par \uc2 A second exercise, which takes a different empirical approach that I'm going to just mention, it was presented in the IMF GFSR [International Monetary Fund Global Financial Stability Report] current Chapter 3. And here they develop a measure of growth at risk as a macro measure of financial stability. And what they're trying to do is look at whether financial sector conditions can predict the probability distribution of future GDP growth. And they're obviously interested in the left tail of the distribution, the downside risks.\par \par \uc2 And this chart shows the 95th, the top, and the 5th percentile of predicted year-ahead GDP growth based on financial conditions. This is averaged for 21 countries, so some of the variability is lost in the averaging. And this is work that's built on work by Tobias Adrian and co-authors when he was still at the New York Fed.\par \par \uc2 And the takeaway from this work is that financial conditions can shift the distribution of future growth. And they find that tighter financial conditions, which are based on asset prices, are predictors of greater downside risks in the near term, say, like, a year ahead, which this shows. And in the medium term, the greater downside risks tend to be brought about by, say, higher borrower leverage. So in this sense, there's a little bit of consistency with what Markus mentioned, a volatility paradox, that you can get looser conditions, can reduce your growth volatility in the near term, but maybe increasing them in the medium to long term.\par \par \uc2 So basically, this measure is, again, trying to put financial stability risks into the same language that's being used to assess other macro risks. And you could imagine countries could develop such a measure over time, gives them a sense of the need for macroprudential policies or, you know, in some imminent, a crisis-management policy.\par \par \uc2 And a third exercise is basically to continue to extend this and condition it on whether credit is high or low, similar to the first exercise I mentioned, which allows even more for some nonlinearities. And for advanced economies, sort of some preliminary work suggests that these kinds of nonlinearities exist.\par \par \uc2 So these three examples are basically testing and finding results that are consistent with a framework for financial stability as the ability of a financial system to absorb shocks rather than to amplify shocks, and they allow for greater downside risks and nonlinearities. OK.\par \par \uc2 My second area I want to pick up on is governance for macroprudential policies. And this is basically asking a question, who makes the decisions about macroprudential policies? And are the governance arrangements effective?\par \par \uc2 All countries have preexisting microprudential regulatory structures and they have central banks, and neither were really designed to implement macroprudential policies. And those kinds of policies require a great deal of coordination across regulators. They may need focus on time-varying risks. Many of these skills don't cross regulators.\par \par \uc2 So, in a new paper I've been working on with Rochelle Edge, we thought we would try to collect some information about what these new authorities look like. And we constructed a data set of authorities for 58 countries. And it's based on public official documents, you know, you look at the central bank websites and the financial stability things, reflects information through 2016.\par \par \uc2 So what we find, and I have two simple bar charts to simplify a few things, 41 of the 58 countries have established financial stability committees or councils. Most of them have been established since 2010. And 15 countries have designated a single entity to be the macroprudential authority and that's generally the central bank.\par \par \uc2 Now, if you weight by GDP \u8211\'20\'13 so the blue line shows what we call the FSCs, the financial stability, the blue bar, and the lighter blue to the right is weighted by GDP, just to give a sense. So you can see that it's the bigger countries that have created the committees. And if you actually think about global activity, this is basically it. The countries that have set up the central banks as the authority don't account for that much. OK.\par \par \uc2 And we then looked at the membership and the leadership. So most of these committees have three or four members. A central bank is always on it, one or two prudential regulators. The ministry of finance isn't always on, but when it is it's almost always the chair. So the next chart to the right shows that the ministry of finance is, you know, the chair about twice as often as the central bank. That raises issues about implementation and whether there's any present bias, I think is the word I heard this morning.\par \par \uc2 And by the way, prudential regulators are always on the committees, but they are never the chair, maybe there's one country. So clearly, they're just sort of delineating responsibilities.\par \par \uc2 Now, judging the effectiveness of these committees is really subjective. I'm just going to use three things which the IMF has set out as being important. Can they coordinate? Are they able to take actions? And are they willing to take actions?\par \par \uc2 So, on coordination, you know, all the committees work to promote information sharing, they all say that. And they seem to have the right setup for their membership, and we do a little testing in the paper. This seems like a good step forward. There is coordination.\par \par \uc2 On the ability to act, we looked at whether any of these committees themselves had specific tools. Did they have the authority to set a counter-cyclical capital buffer, implement a stress test, set an LTV? We found that actually only two councils, the U.K. and France, have what we call hard tools that they can direct an action of any of its members or itself. Another nine have comply or explain, which means they can sort of express a view that somebody should do something, but that agency then has a choice to say whether they think they should do it or not. That means most of these committees meet just to share information.\par \par \uc2 Now, the separate regulators continue to have these authorities to set the policies. And the central bank can provide the sort of time-varying risk analysis. But many regulators themselves do not have financial stability mandates, so there may well be a very big disconnect in many countries over the authority for tools and the responsibility for financial stability.\par \par \uc2 A willingness to act, I think it's too early to tell and it's the hardest, but I think this point that they don't have tools, they're run by the ministry of finance suggests that there are some challenges ahead.\par \par \uc2 So I think one takeaway from this is, in the meantime, monetary policy makers or macro policy makers should not assume that there are these new committees in place to offset pro-cyclicality. OK.\par \par \uc2 And then I guess to conclude, just to repeat, I'm optimistic on models to make progress on defining targets and assessing nonlinearities and linking them to the economics. But we're pretty far away from setting policies. And there's clearly a need to invest in creating accountability for financial stability.\par \par \uc2 OK, thank you.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Thank you very much, Nellie.\par \par \uc2 Finally, turning to Jeremy Stein of Harvard University.\par \par \uc2 JEREMY STEIN: So this is a terrific paper, as the other discussants have mentioned. It covers a lot of ground. I agree with much of what Andy has to say. And in particular, you know, there's a big part of the paper which I think basically has the message that we're probably at the low end of the ideal range on overall capital and that some of the most dramatic complaints that the banks had about loan supply have not been borne out. So, if anything, if we were going to err in one direction or another, we might err on the side of increasing it. So I agree with that.\par \par \uc2 What I thought I would do is spend my time \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Our elves are \u8211\'20\'13 our elves are apparently behind the curtain.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: OK. I'm going to spend my time on \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: I'm sorry.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: I think there is one place where we do have different views, and that's holding fix the level of capital. How do you \u8211\'20\'13 how do you implement it? And in particular, the whole belt-and-suspenders thing. I mean, you had a kind of British joke about suspenders, yeah.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Braces, suspenders.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: I don't think it's a good look. So that's basically the point of my discussion. (Laughter.) I'm not a fan of belt and suspenders. I'll tell you, I actually have tried on and off over several years to try to think analytically. You know, what is the \u8211\'20\'13 you know, is there a model in which you can actually make sense of sort of the informal logic? It's really hard. So that's the point I wanted to make. But I could kind of use my slides.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: All right. I'm terribly sorry.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: No, no, no. So let me start. Let me start with the cons, and then I'll come back to the pros. I'll come back to the pros that you raised.\par \par \uc2 There's two sort of obvious cons, I think. So actually, let me be clear. I'm not arguing in any way against capital and liquidity requirements, because I think those are distinct. I'm arguing a narrower point, which is, in the world of capital, do you want to have two binding constraints, in some sense, on the same item, which is how much equity, OK? And, you know, the concrete thing is a risk-based capital requirement and a leverage ratio which, in the U.S., has been dialed up pretty substantially via the supplementary leverage ratio.\par \par \uc2 An easy argument I think everybody sort of appreciates is if the supplementary leverage ratio is calibrated so aggressively that it actually binds \u8211\'20\'13 look at that; all right, the little bubbles and everything \u8211\'20\'13 OK, if the thing is so aggressive that it actually binds, well, then you're left with just an unrisk-weighted ratio, and that has kind of some goofy properties like it's pretty tough on Treasurys and on repo and all that. OK, and there's some evidence that it's been binding, at least in the U.S., and that it's had some effect on treasury markets.\par \par \uc2 I'm going to sort of set that aside and focus on a sort of subtler \u8211\'20\'13 what may be a subtler point, which is, if banks are heterogeneous and have different business models, and in particular different ratios of risk-weighted to not risk-weighted assets \u8211\'20\'13 one constraint may bind for one and another constraint may bind for the other.\par \par \uc2 So, concretely, think of Wells Fargo, sort of a typical bank bank. It's got a relatively high ratio of risk-weighted to total assets. It's more likely to be bound by the traditional risk-based. Think of Goldman Sachs. It has more securities, basically, on its balance sheet, so it's more likely to be bound by the other. So they're now going to be operating essentially in different regimes. It's like operating in different tax regimes. And that's going to create some forces towards migration that basically, for Wells Fargo, they're not bound by the leverage ratio. They don't face any marginal risk charge for, like, treasury securities, so they ought to do, like, more investment banking.\par \par \uc2 Lo and behold, Wells Fargo is doing more investment banking. OK, Goldman Sachs has got to think, geez, if I only had a bank, this leverage ratio wouldn't be preventing me from doing the stuff I like to do in the repo market. So, lo and behold, they're going to acquire a bank, which they have done.\par \par \uc2 So, you know, that's the concern. And basically, if you just work through the algebra of it, what it does is it drives everybody essentially to some kind of a universal banking type of model.\par \par \uc2 So what I've got here \u8211\'20\'13 here's just a picture of which constraints bind or are closest to binding for different banks. Don't stare at it too hard. What it's basically saying is the bankier kind of banks, those that are more kind of traditional commercial banks \u8211\'20\'13 Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank or PNC \u8211\'20\'13 tend to be bound either by a pre- or post-stress version of a risk-based ratio, whereas many of the others, the investment banks and the universals, are more bound by something like the supplementary leverage ratio.\par \par \uc2 So what you can do \u8211\'20\'13 this is a bit of a project, but basically you can take \u8211\'20\'13 for each bank, assume it's operating under only its most binding constraint, and then you can think, for each bank in each type of activity, what is going to be the marginal risk charge, given that most binding thing? This is my multiple-tax-regime point.\par \par \uc2 Let's see, do I have a laser pointer?\par \par \uc2 So, you know, the point here is if you look at Wells Fargo, which is bound by the Tier 1 ratio, it has very different capital charges than some of its peers. And in particular it has relatively high capital charges for a lot of lending types of activities but a much lower capital charge for securities-type stuff.\par \par \uc2 And you can see that this has changed behavior. So this is a regression where, on the horizontal axis \u8211\'20\'13 I'm sorry \u8211\'20\'13 on the horizontal axis, we've got the banks' initial RWA-to-A [risk-weighted assets to assets] ratio as of 2012. And again, there's sort of a natural pattern where the banky banks are down here \u8211\'20\'13 Wells Fargo, PNC and U.S. Bancorp \u8211\'20\'13 and either the custody banks or the investment banks are up here.\par \par \uc2 And what you see is essentially a convergence. So we're looking at the change in risk-weighted assets to assets as a function of the starting level, and there's a very, very strong relationship, which, again, the shorthand version is Wells Fargo is sort of moving in or guys like Wells Fargo are moving more into investment banking-type stuff, and the investment banks are moving more into banking stuff. And so the prediction is we're going to get guys looking more similar.\par \par \uc2 So that would be the concern. Now let's take some of the arguments on the other side. So this is a couple of the ones that Andy highlighted. And I just want to be careful on the tone here. The concerns that animate the leverage ratio are centrally important \u8211\'20\'13 OK, absolutely important. And it's just a question of whether the right way to deal with those concerns is by having sort of a competing capital standard or by trying to integrate those concerns into essentially a single rule.\par \par \uc2 OK, so, for example, there's the sort of idea of Knightian uncertainty, which is, you know, who knows what the risk weights are? Surely the standard risk weights are wrong in some sense, and wouldn't it be good to have another sort of alternative just, you know, for robustness?\par \par \uc2 So here's the analytical proposition, which is tell me whatever your favorite calibration is of these two things, OK. Now, think about a representative bank. That calibration is going to amount to \u8211\'20\'13 like, it's going to have a multiplier of 0.8 on this constraint and a multiplier 0.2 on the other constraint, right. It's going to be doing some averaging, OK.\par \par \uc2 I would prefer to then take a single constraint; that is, the average of those two. That gets you the same thing for the average bank, but it gets rid of the heterogeneity. That's a thing where I have a very hard time sort of thinking about the logic of there being two, because I can always, in some sense, take the virtues. So, you know, you don't like there being a zero-risk weight stuff \u8211\'20\'13 on stuff that looks low-risk, because we know it's not. So absolutely weight it up, OK.\par \par \uc2 I don't know that that means you want to go to the extreme of having a uniform risk weight, but that's sort of the idea, OK.\par \par \uc2 Let's see. How am I doing on \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Four minutes.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: OK. So the other point \u8211\'20\'13 again, enormously important point \u8211\'20\'13 and you have these pictures \u8211\'20\'13 you know, the risk-based requirements can be gamed. Yeah, they absolutely can be. But, of course \u8211\'20\'13 and, you know, you showed that historically the leverage ratio performs better in terms of predicting distress than the risk-based stuff did. Well, of course. I mean, that's in some sense Goodhart's law, which is the risk-based stuff was the stuff that \u8211\'20\'13 that was the thing that was in force, so that was the thing that was being gamed under the old regime.\par \par \uc2 My prediction is if you make the leverage ratio be more binding, it will be gamed as well and you're going to be \u8211\'20\'13 you know, you're going to be sort of back to square one. So the problem is not \u8211\'20\'13 I don't think the problem is so much with the risk-based thing per se. It's with the rule. I mean, you know, financial regulation is just a terrible, terrible business to be in \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 because \u8211\'20\'13 I mean, it's not a joke, right, because you \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 it's a sad thing. But it's because of sort of the timing of it. You move. You write a capital requirement. You set it in stone. And then guys have at it, right.\par \par \uc2 So, you know, what needs to be done, to some extent, is to change the timing of the game, to see, you know, can I fill in some of these contingencies ex post, after the banks have moved? So, in our view, you know, you've got to do something with this, but the something might be to try to use the stress test, for example, as a way to do some filling in of contingencies ex post.\par \par \uc2 So, for example, you know, what we have in mind concretely is you have a relatively simple and \u8211\'20\'13 you know, you understand going in it's not going to be a \u8211\'20\'13 it's going to be a far, far from perfect rule. And then you \u8211\'20\'13 each year, when you design the stress scenario, you say to yourself I'm going to look ex post. What are the banks doing? So what are the areas where they have been growing rapidly? Who are their 10 most highly compensated traders? What are their exposures? Stress those.\par \par \uc2 OK, it's understanding that you can't, ex ante, write the contract \u8211\'20\'13 no matter what you do, you can't write the contract all that well, and there needs to be a little bit more reliance on using the stress test or some device like that to fill in \u8211\'20\'13 to fill in ex post. OK, so that's the basic \u8211\'20\'13 that's the basic story.\par \par \uc2 Again, I think the sort of thing that has animated Andy's work and others who have sort of argued for multiple constraints are absolutely at the center of the problem. You know, and the regulatory arbitrage in particular is at the center of the problem. I just don't know that the problem is solved by essentially, you know, trying to replace one bad rule with another bad rule.\par \par \uc2 And then the last thing I'll say \u8211\'20\'13 and this sort of, I think, resonates with your earlier point \u8211\'20\'13 is, you know, another motivation, I think, especially in the political \u8211\'20\'13 in the political arena for, let's say, the leverage rate is just a general desire to be tough. It's just another \u8211\'20\'13 the more constraints, the more likely to be bound by one of them, and it's just sort of going to raise overall capital, which I think is great, but I think you can do that again by doing something like dialing up the GSIB [global systemically important bank] surcharges rather than by having multiples rules.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Thank you very much, Jeremy.\par \par \uc2 Andy would probably love to respond. I have a couple of questions I'd like to put to the panel. But I'm conscious we've run long, and more that we have enormous expertise in the room. So let me open it up to questions. Again, the drill is we have a couple of roving mics up front. Or if it's easier, come to the standing mic. No matter how brilliant and famous you are, please identify yourself when you ask a question so I don't have to.\par \par \uc2 Please.\par \par \uc2 Q: We're going to start out with somebody who's not brilliant or famous and does not have a deep reservoir of knowledge. But this is for Jeremy.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Then what's your name?\par \par \uc2 Q: Peter Coy from Bloomberg Businessweek.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Randy Quarles [incoming Fed vice chairman in charge of bank oversight] has been one of the people who has been sympathetic to the banks' view that the Fed's stress tests are arbitrary and that it's unfair to change the rules year after year. And yet, the way you described it, that's exactly what we need. So where do you stand on that?\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: I think this is the essence of the problem. So I freely admit that, you know, doing what I suggest and sort of having these stress scenarios change is more discretionary. It feels less like, I guess, due process. You could imagine challenges, I suppose, under the Administrative Procedures Act. But this \u8211\'20\'13 it's, in some sense, the central tension.\par \par \uc2 I think, you know, obviously, the banks, it makes sense. They would like to have transparency. That is kind of tell us what's going to be on the test. But then the whole stress-test thing really, at least in peacetime, just devolves to a complicated \u8211\'20\'13 another complicated capital rule. If it's going to have sort of a distinctive benefit, I think you have to at least be willing to try to push it in this direction.\par \par \uc2 I acknowledge that there are costs. And, I mean, the one way you might sort of try to, you know, find a medium, if you will, is transparency has a couple of dimensions. You can think of ex ante transparency and ex post transparency. So I think this theory suggests there's a limit to how far you can go with ex ante transparency. You can only \u8211\'20\'13 you can't just tell them exactly what's going to be on the test.\par \par \uc2 I think, at the same time, the Fed could do much more in terms of ex post transparency. They can explain, this is exactly \u8211\'20\'13 this is, you know, the way we varied the scenarios. This is the reason for why we varied the scenarios. Importantly, one thing that they don't disclose now is these are the risk weights that were implicit, essentially, in the scenarios, because, you know, if we had this kind of losses on small-business loans, you have a high capital charge, effectively, on small-business loans. They can do some of that. But if you \u8211\'20\'13 I think if you capitulate to the desire for perfect ex ante transparency, you've neutered a sort of important potential virtue of the stress test.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Does anybody else from our panel \u8211\'20\'13 does anybody else from our panel want to comment on stress testing in general or specific? No?\par \par \uc2 I'll just remind people, we have published a couple of months ago a book by Morris Goldstein on this topic, which I think, in some ways, comes down similar to where Jeremy does.\par \par \uc2 Next question. Please, Jose. I mean, sorry. You, Lorenzo. Go.\par \par \uc2 Q: I feel \u8211\'20\'13 and I want to be a bit provocative.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of Societ\u232\'00\'E8 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale.\par \par \uc2 Q: Sorry. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi. Now I am a banker. (Laughter.) So it's a kind of \u8211\'20\'13 I don't know in the Frisbee thing, even the dog, and if I am the Frisbee. (Laughter.) I never really understood. (Laughter.) But I understood a lot from this session what the incentive of the regulator is.\par \par \uc2 But just as a question or a thought, I'm not so convinced about your story, Andy, although I didn't really read the whole paper. I didn't have the 10 minutes warning. Because in the end, I mean, you have a nice story that, you know, we should have 19 percent capital, why don't we have 19 percent \u8211\'20\'13 although it doesn't have an impact on credits \u8211\'20\'13 and I'll come back on that one. I really sometime wonder where you live, which kind of world you live. But because the world is complicated, so you have \u8211\'20\'13 it's better to have different rules so we can have lower capital with all this TLAC and \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible). And you have these nice \u8211\'20\'13 these nice simulations, but I would say what \u8211\'20\'13 suggest what Jeremy Stein said, that, you know, once you incorporate this into a new world, it's not going to be that easy to catch, because you will \u8211\'20\'13 the banks will make a combination, an optimization of capital and liquidity that will make it again difficult for the regulator to catch you.\par \par \uc2 So the truth is that higher capital, at least in a transition, makes credit more difficult. And you can see it; otherwise, you would not be doing QE, very long-term refinancing operation in the ECB, and so on and so forth. So in the transition, if you move from one capital level to another, you will have an impact, and that's \u8211\'20\'13 we have seen that. And I'm not convinced by the BIS [Bank for International Settlements] papers. The BIS paper is a comparative static paper. And of course, in an economy which is well-performing, higher capital is better than lower capital. But you have to get there. And coming out from the crisis, it has been having \u8211\'20\'13 it has had an impact on credit, I think. But the key \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Do you want to put a \u8211\'20\'13 do you want to put a question mark at some point?\par \par \uc2 Q: Yes, no, the question is, the last point that you don't \u8211\'20\'13 that you raise, which in my view is fundamental. Is the financial sector to be \u8211\'20\'13 or maybe you want to generalize \u8211\'20\'13 what kind of financial sector do we want? And this maybe should be the first question, not the last one. And maybe you should see who say that this is not the role of regulators to ask this question. But if you don't ask this question at the beginning, you as regulator become involved with it and have an impact of it. And I think that if you put the capital requirement at 16, 20 or 25, you will have an impact \u8211\'20\'13 or maybe I should put it as a question mark \u8211\'20\'13 you could have an impact on the structure of the banking system. And if you look at \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: We'd settle for a period, actually.\par \par \uc2 Q: Yes. (Laughter.) And if you look at the banking sector and those that are \u8211\'20\'13 have these kind of capital ratios, they have monopolistic power. And is this desirable or not? I think that's the question that the regulator has to ask.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: OK, Lorenzo, enough joking. That's enough.\par \par \uc2 Q: Yeah, so the question is, shouldn't you start by where you ended? I mean, what kind of financial system do we want \u8211\'20\'13 in different countries, of course \u8211\'20\'13 and start your regulatory framework from that rather than asking the question at the end, which may be suboptimal in framing \u8211\'20\'13 as a result of your willingness to catch the frisbee.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: To restate, what would be \u8211\'20\'13 should you start with what should be the optimal financial system, and if you did, how would you go about defining it?\par \par \uc2 Andy.\par \par \uc2 MR. HALDANE: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Lorenzo, you've changed since you became a banker. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 So I think that is a good thought experiment but \u8211\'20\'13 and in some ways that is the one we're about to engage on. So I think the priority immediately after the point where the boat was sinking was to fill the leaks in the boat. And in some ways, that is the job we've been doing for the last decade or more. The public \u8211\'20\'13 rightly \u8211\'20\'13 don't forgive you if you don't fix the known problems. And in some ways that's what we've been doing, I think \u8211\'20\'13 to fix \u8211\'20\'13 fixing the known problems, market failure by market failure.\par \par \uc2 And now is the point, having patched the boat, to ask the question, where do we now sit? Is this actually the boat we want? Is it able to furnish the needs of the real economy, and the way we would wish? And I think that is the essay question that is now posed to us \u8211\'20\'13 rightly posed to us, because it's the one that society is posing. And I hope it's one that we come up with a decent answer to.\par \par \uc2 I should say on that front, I think some of the direction of travel has been pretty positive. And Beno\u238\'00\'EEt mentioned this \u8211\'20\'13 so the fact that Europe, including the U.K., is moving in the direction of having a second engine \u8211\'20\'13 in other words, a nonbank engine, a market-based finance engine is very much the right direction of travel. That's a different boat than what we had previously. It means the system is more diverse, and therefore, resilient I think than would have been the case in the past. So I think some of that's happened on the fly and some more of it will happen, I think, in the next decade. It's the right essay question.\par \par \uc2 On credit and capital, I mean, Sebastian (sp) is here and has a paper that speaks to this question, reaches a slightly different conclusion, as would a number of other papers in a similar sort of direction. I wouldn't say there's nothing here, Lorenzo, by way of tightening credit conditions, but it's \u8211\'20\'13 you know, from what I've seen, it's no greater than was already figured in the calculus when we arrived at the initial \u8211\'20\'13 at the initial numbers.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Thank you. Thank you, Andy.\par \par \uc2 Would anybody else care to come in?\par \par \uc2 Yes, Beno\u238\'00\'EEt.\par \par \uc2 MR. COEUR\u201\'00\'C9: No, I can \u8211\'20\'13 I can say a short word and just to illustrate \u8211\'20\'13 to illustrate one of Lorenzo's point, which is the adverse impact of capital ratios on lending, I mean, if you look at the eurozone back since, say, 2007, 2008, you had a starting in, say, 2011, 2012. You had a consistent and very quite steep increase in CET1 [common equity tier 1] ratios for a large eurozone bonds. And at the same time, you have an acceleration of credit. So the correlation is that way. It's positive.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Anyone else?\par \par \uc2 MS. LIANG: And I would just add the evidence from the U.S. would support what Beno\u238\'00\'EEt was just saying. We've gotten to a place where higher capital and higher growth have this positive feedback and not a less lending, and it's the strong banks that are resilient to shocks and can continue to lend. So there is a transition, absolutely. But in some sense, Basel tried to address that by a long transition period that works only somewhat since everything gets pulled forward. But there is, in practice, an opportunity for banks to transition \u8211\'20\'13 take a longer transition period.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Jeremy.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: Can I just say one other point on the capital and transition? So, you know, your point is essentially that the flow cost of raising new equity is higher than the steady state cost of having it on the balance sheet in some sense. So that's the sort of time. So that's of course completely right. Those flow costs tend to be private costs more so than social costs. Like, guys don't want to dilute their shareholders.\par \par \uc2 And the implication of that \u8211\'20\'13 so for example, the \u8211\'20\'13 you know, the extreme case of this is during the financial crisis, when the capital's really depleted. I don't think that the right answer is that we should have low capital. It's that sometimes you need to focus not just on capital ratios but on dollars of capital. So I thought the central design in sight of the 2009 SCAP [Supervisory Capital Assessment Program] was \u8211\'20\'13 when the stress tests were done, we didn't look at Bank of America and go, oh, you know, you don't have a lot of capital, you need to improve your capital ratio by 2 percentage points. We said you need 33 points whatever billion dollars of new capital. So they didn't have the ability to kind of get to the ratio by shrinking assets. You had to push. I mean, policy has to not take these flow costs as just a given constraint, but has to push against them. So I fully agree that they're there. But again, I think they're more \u8211\'20\'13 they're more in the vein of private than social costs, so that's something we're \u8211\'20\'13 you know, my wish for the stress test next time around when there's, you know, a stress scenario is that policy makers have the resolve \u8211\'20\'13 unlike in 2007 \u8211\'20\'13 to be more aggressive about essentially, you know, cutting off dividends and compelling new equity issues.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 Another question. We can probably fit in three in that amount of time. Yes, next person.\par \par \uc2 Q: (Inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 Bloomberg View.\par \par \uc2 I have a question for Andy Haldane about the key question which he underlined in his presentation, which is basically whether you can reduce capital requirements just because you think you have an effective resolution regime. I mean, you seem to suggest that's the case.\par \par \uc2 Now I have two doubts with regard to that proposition. One is \u8211\'20\'13 was actually pointed out in your presentation. How credible are these resolution regimes? We just don't know, particularly for large banks.\par \par \uc2 And the second point is, if you have in mind multiple \u8211\'20\'13 in a way multiple constraints or multiple rules, I wonder whether this is undermining that logic, because in a way, just because you have a resolution regime, you are making the capital requirement be less effective by lowering it. And I know this is very important also for the Bank of England, because I believe you've taken a decision not to enforce the full systemic risk buffers, partly because of this idea that resolution regimes can \u8211\'20\'13 I think John Baker (sp) has pointed out that that was a mistake you made last year. So I just wonder whether, you know, any \u8211\'20\'13 not just you but other people on the panel had comments on that.\par \par \uc2 MR. HALDANE: So the question is the right one, and it's true enough that at this stage we cannot have the case law on whether the shiny new resolution arrangements that are being put in place statutorily throughout the world, and the accompanying nonequity sources of \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 debt will indeed be bailed in in the sort of situations of stress that we saw during the crisis. So I have a lot of confidence that if failures are small and singular, that this will be relatively easy to pull off, and U.S. experience over many decades speaks to that being the case.\par \par \uc2 But the rubber hits the road \u8211\'20\'13 and this certainly has resonance in the systemic states of the world that you mention. In those states, I do think that \u8211\'20\'13 you know, a lot of talk today about the time-consistency problem as it pertains to monetary policy. I think that is as nothing by comparison to the time-consistency problem as it pertains to financial stability in those systems, as Adam said next to me. I absolutely believe that. I think the problem, both on the way in, given the longer duration of buildup of stress and the scale of the cost when stress hits, means that the knife edge, the \u8211\'20\'13 (inaudible) \u8211\'20\'13 is that much greater, and therefore the pre-commitment problem is that much greater.\par \par \uc2 And if you look at the history of bail-in debt, bail-in debt's got a history of at least 150 years, and bail-in has tended to be honored in the breach. It hasn't happened for these \u8211\'20\'13 for just these reasons. Because if you were the finance minister or treasury secretary of the day faced up against, you know, do I write the check or do I punish the widows and orphans, it's easy which \u8211\'20\'13 it's easy to know which choice to make.\par \par \uc2 Will next time be different? I hope so. And lots of thought, much more thought than ever previously over this 150 years has gone into the design of instruments and design of a regime that can make it materially more time consistent than any in the past. But ultimately \u8211\'20\'13 ultimately \u8211\'20\'13 this is in part an act of faith, and only time will tell.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Let me say, since Larry set the model that one doesn't have to be a neutral chair, one can editorialize a bit, I'm nodding vociferously not because I'm a hundred percent in agreement with Andy or because I fully have his sophisticated views, but two weeks ago at his conference I was pushing the idea that the time and consistency moral hazard problem for policy makers and regulators is far worse on the financial side than monetary side. And we've spent so much broken crockery through the years, including recessions and hard money constraints, to prove we're tough on time and consistency, and then we wring our hands about proving we're tough and perhaps taking away some of the discretion from policymakers and say, oh, my god, it's a terrible tradeoff on the banking side. And so just the spirit of Andy's comments, I at least think I'm very much in favor of.\par \par \uc2 But allow me to let the real experts speak. Does anyone else to care to come in on this?\par \par \uc2 Yes, Beno\u238\'00\'EEt.\par \par \uc2 MR. COEUR\u201\'00\'C9: Just one short remark exactly \u8211\'20\'13 I mean, to that discussion on time and consistency. I mean, there is a \u8211\'20\'13 there is always a tradeoff between ex ante incentives and ex post incentives. So that's not new, and it is very \u8211\'20\'13 it's much more severe in the field of financial regulation than in the field of monetary policy. I agree with that. But if it's only between ex ante incentives and ex post incentive, it's fine. But what we've seen is regulators being soft ex ante. So you \u8211\'20\'13 at least you want it to be a tradeoff.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Yes. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. COEUR\u201\'00\'C9: You want to see the tradeoff. And so if you're too \u8211\'20\'13 if you're too nice ex ante, it's not even a tradeoff.\par \par \uc2 MR. BRUNNERMEIER: Can I just point out one thing?\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Yeah, please, Markus.\par \par \uc2 MR. BRUNNERMEIER: So I totally agree with that the time inconsistency on the financial regulation side is much more pronounced. But, on the other hand, we have also heard we would like to have more discretion on stress tests rather than rules. So typically, when we have a lot of time inconsistency, we need more strict rules and more binding constraints. On the other hand, rules will be gamed. So this makes this whole ground \u8211\'20\'13 playground even more dangerous and difficult to handle.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Interesting. OK.\par \par \uc2 Another question, please.\par \par \uc2 Please, there, if you could stand up at the mic. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Q: Yeah, I'm Christian Kopf, now at Union Investment.\par \par \uc2 Andy Haldane, you argued that if you impose a leverage ratio in excess of 3 percent, then you get more false alarms when banks are fine. Actually, my question is, so what? So what actually is the social costs involved in there? I mean, what is the actual cost to the economy?\par \par \uc2 And likewise, Jeremy Stein, you said that if you pulled a very high leverage ratio, then the system converges to a universal banking model. My question is, so what?\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: And I take it, sir, you mean so what from the social welfare point of view. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 MR. HALDANE: Yeah, so on your first point, so what, I mean, I was sort of \u8211\'20\'13 I was inadvertently invoking my inner Lorenzo when arguing anything above 3 percent might come at some cost, of course. If you buy the argument that going high, it need not be costly, then that falls away.\par \par \uc2 Just because I've got the floor, just on that point, I mean, many people have rightly made the point that there are sort of kind of actual experiments that I showed you come with huge caveats and cautions for Lucas critique-y, Goodhart law-y type reasons. Absolutely that must be true. Equally, it was the case that even pre-crisis some countries, including this one, did have a leverage regime. Russia had a regime in place. So, too, did Canada. And actually, even in those countries that had that regime in place, the leverage ratio did a better job of picking losers than did the other regime. So that isn't a knockdown argument, but it goes in the direction that there's more here than the regime in explaining what was \u8211\'20\'13 what was going on there.\par \par \uc2 It was a question also for Jeremy.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: Yeah. This is the so what question of whether \u8211\'20\'13 you know, what's the big deal if everybody becomes a universal. It's a really good question. I don't \u8211\'20\'13 it's sort of easy for me to go they're all going to be universal banks. Ooh, you know? I don't know. I mean, you know, in the short run you'll get guys moving away from things that they're used to doing that they have skill at and that that's an issue. I sort of have some ill-defined sense that in a stress scenario, having everybody have the same business model may not be ideal in terms of the resilience of the system, but I'd be hard-pressed to kind of put a number or a magnitude on it.\par \par \uc2 But the way I would push back is, you know, the bar on that depends on how much benefit we're getting from this system on the other side of the ledger. So, again, my real point would be, I think you can get many of the benefits \u8211\'20\'13 again, these are important benefits that Andy alludes to \u8211\'20\'13 with a more intelligently designed single constraint type of system. So if you can get those benefits relatively cheaply, the bar on the so what question is lowered somewhat. Again, so I would do \u8211\'20\'13 I would try to take a lot of the benefits of the leverage ratio in my ideal risk-based system that wouldn't be zero risk weight on anything, uncertainty would drive up risk weights in general, all that kind of stuff. But, again, if you do it the same for everybody \u8211\'20\'13 again, what's crazy about the sort of dual system is both of these regimes, which we've all sort of stipulated we don't like either one by itself, basically some guys are facing one and some guys are facing the other. So you're not even getting some of the benefits that \u8211\'20\'13 some of the robustness benefits you'd ideally like to get.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Thank you.\par \par \uc2 Just I'm required to make one more advertisement. Our colleague, William Cline, also published a book with us a few months ago that takes on some of these issues and tries to say from a first principles basis, much like Andy started, what are the tradeoffs of higher capital from a social welfare function. And he comes out with a lower number for capital than many of these other studies, but still at least as high as currently is held.\par \par \uc2 Let me take one more question. This has been a terrific discussion, everybody. Please, someone? Or else I'll ask a question.\par \par \uc2 Yes, at the back, Richard.\par \par \uc2 Q: Richard Cantor from Moody's.\par \par \uc2 Questions for Jeremy or anyone else who wants to answer. You spoke of the advantage of having a single capital measure, and you also spoke of the wonders of stress tests. I wondered how those two go together. My own thought about stress tests is that if you knew the capital model you wanted, risk-based model, you would just impose that. You wouldn't need the stress test. It's probably too difficult politically to evolve this risk-based model over time as your views of risk change, and so that it's really a backdoor way of imposing the higher capital requirements on the banks that you think already need them, but doing it privately without a rule that drives it.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: So let's see. So a couple points. One, I mean, you're right that, you know, for many banks there \u8211\'20\'13 I talked about the multiple constraint problem of there being the risk-based capital and the leverage ratio. There's another dimension to it, which is there's the pre-stress and the post-stress capital requirements. So Nellie and others in Fed and [former Fed governor] Dan Tarullo have talked about those being merged by having essentially a single requirement where the stress test stuff feeds into \u8211\'20\'13 what do you call it \u8211\'20\'13 a risk something buffer \u8211\'20\'13 a stress capital buffer \u8211\'20\'13 a stress capital buffer that sort of \u8211\'20\'13 and again, so then you have a sort of more in the mode of a single constraint.\par \par \uc2 But then, again, I think we have exactly the \u8211\'20\'13 you've highlighted once again the tension. If the stress tests are going to do something useful beyond just being part of the standard regime, you'll have to be kind of doing something a little discretionary, but it does take us away from a rule. And if you think that regulation has to be done by rules and that's sort of the right way to do things, you're \u8211\'20\'13 you know, there's a real \u8211\'20\'13 there's a real problem. But again, we know the problems with rules, and I think we need to at least explore whether we can kind of equate the marginal cost a little bit by pushing the \u8211\'20\'13 you know, pushing the discretionary bit at least a little bit \u8211\'20\'13 little bit more.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: Would anyone else \u8211\'20\'13 yes, Nellie, please.\par \par \uc2 MS. LIANG: So I \u8211\'20\'13 if I could just expand on that a little bit, I think if we knew risk weights, we could just use a single risk weight count-based system. And if the risks also did not vary over time, and it didn't matter if risks were rising or \u8211\'20\'13 and it was symmetric, it wouldn't matter. But in general, we care if risks are rising and the risk weights, the constant risk weights don't go up with it. So I think there \u8211\'20\'13 this is this nonlinearity that I think is important.\par \par \uc2 The stress tests have tried to incorporate the current balance sheet and current risks that are from the balance sheet. So stress tests let you get a little bit forward-looking and time-varying capital. It does introduce complexity, and I think this proposal to integrate using the stress test to calculate what would be sort of the capital conservation buffer would sort of \u8211\'20\'13 help to simplify the capital regime over time. But it a proposal, and it's probably at this point not a formal proposal, but has been out there. And with the spirit of simplifying the capital requirements, but allowing the \u8211\'20\'13 a bit of discretion because the economy is sort of \u8211\'20\'13 it's not constant, you know? And so you get \u8211\'20\'13 you care about the downside risks more than you care about the upside risks.\par \par \uc2 MR. BRUNNERMEIER: So I was pondering about this timing consistency and the stress tests, so perhaps one way out is to delegate it to committees and delegate it to the right people who have the right incentives. And \u8211\'20\'13 because we can't use rules, in one sense.\par \par \uc2 MR. STEIN: If I might say, this is very analogous to monetary policy. If you believe that a Taylor rule doesn't work, you need some discretion. But then of course, the chair testifies twice a year and is really \u8211\'20\'13 is on the hook for explaining why they did what they did, and you try to cure the ex ante discretion with a lot of ex-post transparency. I mean, it's not obviously perfect, but that's \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: I would push \u8211\'20\'13 sorry, go ahead.\par \par \uc2 MR. BRUNNERMEIER: Finally \u8211\'20\'13 but let me just \u8211\'20\'13 one more comment. The problem that, you know, all banks merging because of these different multiple regulation, of course, one could make it even more complicated and say we have a functional approach. So whenever you're a traditional commercial bank, yes, we apply the rules \u8211\'20\'13 all the rules of this unit and we apply all the rules to investment arm separately; then you get around this merging wave phenomenon. But, of course, it makes, then, the whole setting way more complex.\par \par \uc2 MR. POSEN: I think one \u8211\'20\'13 I wouldn't push too hard on the monetary analogy in that sense. There's a difference between saying there's a rule that every bank or every regulated financial institution under the appropriate remit gets a stress test every year and broadly the terms and goals of the stress test are X, and then there's some operational independence that you can change and alter the stress. Again, I'm not saying you're disagreeing with that, but I just \u8211\'20\'13 I'm worried we're confusing levels of the problem here.\par \par \uc2 But anyway, look, this has been a fantastic session. This week we sort of talked not jokingly this morning about technocracy, and in our conversation with [former U.S. Treasury Secretary] Larry [Summers] and Olivier to start the day. This, to me, is an example of technocracy at its best, that academics, public servants and financial sector participants, market people really coming together and trying to grapple in Andy's sense of what are the risks, we've got to repair the boat now, but then as Lorenzo rightly raises, we also have got to decide what's the boat we want to be in.\par \par \uc2 And so I commend to you Andy and his co-author's paper. I commend to you the fact that all these discussants came in with real comments and discussions. I commend to all of you for your stamina in going through the whole day.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Commodity Traders Field Questions On Bitcoin\par \par \uc2 Attention around bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is leading some to seek advice from traditional commodity traders.

Investment in the sector this year is on track to eclipse last year's total of $13.3 billion, with $13 billion already raised this year to date.\par \par \uc2 That funding pace comes amid an increased overlap in computer science and biology that has enabled earlier-stage companies to receive venture funding.\par \par \uc2 "It's an incredible new era of drug discovery, not just in actual drugs but in the therapies and the technology to deliver them," said \uc2 ARCH Venture Partners\uc2  Managing Director \uc2 Kristina Burow\uc2 . "There are these really difficult situations that we're able to get new insights on because of computer aided technology and a deep understanding of genomics."\par \par \uc2 Deal flow is also up, with 687 financing rounds done year to date, vs. 641 at this point last year.\par \par \uc2 Across all investment sectors in the U.S., two of the third quarter's biggest venture deals were in health-care companies. \uc2 Auris Surgical Robotics Inc\uc2 . raised $280 million in late-stage financing to continue developing robotics-assisted tools for surgeons, and \uc2 23andMe Inc\uc2 . got a $250 million round led by Sequoia Capital as the consumer-genomics startup turned its attention to drug development and drew a valuation of $1.7 billion.\par \par \uc2 23andMe\uc2 's genetic sequencing and analysis coupled with life science discovery opportunities may best exemplify the crossover appeal spurring investments. But smaller, newer startups merging biology with advanced computing are also renewing interest in firms more traditionally rooted in technology.\par \par \uc2 Data Collective, which has been wading deeper into life sciences in the past couple of years, just led an oversubscribed {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/recursion-pharma-gets-second-round-this-year-1507030200"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $60 million Series B }}}\uc2 in Utah startup Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which uses \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to spot new drug targets. \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , which recently hired Jorge Conde as another general partner to its two-year-old bio fund, led {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mariss-section-32-anne-wojcicki-back-freenomes-quest-to-detect-cancer-earlier-1503660622"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 a $72 million Series A}}}\uc2  round in biotech startup \uc2 Freenome Inc\uc2 . \uc2 Menlo Ventures{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-menlo-ventures-its-back-to-biotech-1507670482"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 just hired }}}\uc2 Greg Yap to lead its push into the intersection of life sciences and technology.\par \par \uc2 Seed funding, while still the smallest in regards to the sheer number of rounds, is also having something of a moment, particularly for biopharmaceuticals and health-care services. This early stage funding accounted for $60 million worth of investment across all health-care categories vs. just a few million dollars a year ago.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the advances in life science discovery, previously overlooked areas like home health care and lab services are getting more funding. Investment in health-care services rose year-over-year, with a 29% increase in the number of deals and a 26% jump in dollars invested.\par \par \uc2 "Services are making a comeback," said Lisa Suennen, senior managing director of health-care investing at \uc2 GE Ventures\uc2 . "They are coming more en vogue again, thank God, because we know that actually getting the care to people is what matters."\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Mack at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Heather.Mack@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heather.Mack@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171016edag0008f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Dozens of high-speed traders and others from Wall Street are helping the Pentagon study how hackers could unleash chaos in the U.S. financial system.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Defense's research arm over the past year and a half has consulted executives at high-frequency trading firms and quantitative hedge funds, and people from exchanges and other financial companies, participants in the discussions said. Officials described the effort as an early-stage pilot project aimed at identifying market vulnerabilities.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\uc2 , or Darpa, began the initiative before the revelations of attacks on \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . and the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  brought public scrutiny of risks to U.S. market infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Participants described meetings as informal sessions in which attendees brainstorm about how hackers might try to bring down U.S. markets, then rank the ideas by feasibility.\par \par \uc2 Among the potential scenarios: Hackers could cripple a widely used payroll system; they could inject false information into stock-data feeds, sending trading algorithms out of whack; or they could flood the stock market with fake sell orders and trigger a market crash.\par \par \uc2 High-speed traders and quant-fund managers, who use sophisticated computer programs to buy and sell stocks, sometimes in fractions of a second, form the core of the group. Such traders tend to have deep expertise in the inner workings of financial markets and the automated systems that account for huge swaths of trading activity today.\par \par \uc2 Darpa\uc2  officials confirmed the effort, which is unclassified but hasn't been previously reported. The Wall Street Journal spoke with several traders who participated in the initiative, called the Financial Markets Vulnerabilities Project.\par \par \uc2 "We started thinking a couple years ago what it would be like if a malicious actor wanted to cause havoc on our financial markets," said Wade Shen, who researched \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  at the \uc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\uc2  before joining Darpa as a program manager in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Darpa\uc2  famously developed the technology behind the internet and stealth bombers. It recruits experts from academia and industry in a bid to keep its thinking fresh. The agency declined to release a list of its financial-industry advisers for the project.\par \par \uc2 There have been three meetings for the project since last year, with another one expected later this year, an agency spokeswoman said. The last meeting took place in a conference room at \uc2 New York University\uc2  this spring over pizza, participants said.\par \par \uc2 High-frequency traders have been vilified by critics such as author Michael Lewis, who accused them in his book "Flash Boys" of exploiting slower-moving investors by "front-running" their orders, though these traders deny doing this and say it isn't even possible.\par \par \uc2 Some of the biggest names in the high-speed trading business have advised Darpa. They include \uc2 Jamil Nazarali\uc2 , senior adviser to the chief executive officer of Citadel Securities, a trading giant responsible for around 20% of daily volume in U.S. stock markets. Misha Malyshev, CEO of trading firm \uc2 Teza Technologies\uc2 , has "advised Darpa on vulnerabilities within the U.S. financial markets," Teza's website said. Manoj Narang, CEO of quant hedge fund Mana Partners, said he had advised Darpa, too.\par \par \uc2 Among potential targets that participants have worried could appeal to hackers given their broad reach are credit-card companies, payment processors and payroll companies such as \uc2 Automatic Data Processing, Inc\uc2 ., or ADP, which handles the paychecks for one in six U.S. workers, participants said.\par \par \uc2 An ADP spokesman said, "We work diligently to protect our clients' data, which includes efforts to prevent, detect and respond to attempted cybersecurity incidents."\par \par \uc2 The Mana Partners CEO said he began taking part in the Darpa meetings as a skeptic, thinking the U.S. stock market was resilient and it was unlikely for attackers to cause anything more than temporary damage. But since then, he has gotten more worried.\par \par \uc2 One scenario he fears: a hack of a U.S. exchange in which the attacker sends a wave of fake sell orders to every firm offering to buy shares. That could potentially erase hundreds of billions of dollars of market value as prices drop and firms try to cover losses by selling on other exchanges, Mr. Narang said.\par \par \uc2 Project participants have also debated the impact of attackers transmitting false data via the electronic feeds that traders use to monitor stock prices, or publishing "fake news" to shake investor confidence.\par \par \uc2 The goal of Darpa's project is to develop a simulation of U.S. markets, which could be used to test scenarios, Mr. Shen said.\par \par \uc2 Such software would need to model complex, interrelated markets -- not just stocks but also markets such as futures -- as well as the behavior of automated trading systems operating within them.\par \par \uc2 Many quantitative trading firms already do something similar, Mr. Narang said. His company won a small contract from Darpa this year to test whether its simulation tool could be used by the agency, according to Mr. Narang and a Darpa spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 The project isn't the first time the Pentagon has studied such risks.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, military experts took part in a two-day war game exploring a "global financial war" involving China and Russia, according to "Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis," a 2011 book by James Rickards. The Applied Physics Laboratory at \uc2 Johns Hopkins University\uc2  hosted the event, a spokesman there confirmed.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20171016000082"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020171016edag0001p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The security issue that caused visitors to \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 .'s website this week to encounter malicious software happened because the site was attempting to use a discontinued web product, security researchers said Friday.\par \par \uc2 The story behind \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's latest web problems is a digital whodunit illustrating the complex nature of the credit-reporting company's online operations and the struggles it has had in securing its systems despite several data breaches in the past year.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, security researchers at security vendor \uc2 Malwarebytes Corp\uc2 . identified a small piece of code on \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's website that connected users to the Netflame.cc internet domain, which was the source of the malicious software. That domain once was used by \uc2 Digital River Inc\uc2 ., an e-commerce and digital-marketing vendor, for a now-defunct web-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  product called Fireclick, \uc2 Digital River\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 But the domain's registration was released in October 2016, three months after \uc2 Digital River\uc2  ended support for Fireclick as part of an "ongoing domain cleanup," said \uc2 Christopher Rence\uc2 , the company's chief information and risk officer.\par \par \uc2 That domain was registered Nov. 15 to an individual with an address listed southeast of Bangkok, according to internet records.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, the Netflame.cc domain was serving up a variety of malicious software, including fraudulent online surveys, adware and software designed to steal online-banking credentials, said Jerome Segura, an analyst with \uc2 Malwarebytes\uc2 . It is common for scammers to be on the lookout for soon-to-expire web domains so they can snatch them up and use them to deliver malicious software, he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Segura also discovered the Central America site of \uc2 TransUnion\uc2 , an \uc2 Equifax\uc2  competitor, connecting to the Netflame.cc domain, he said.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  didn't respond to a message seeking comment Friday. On Thursday, the company blamed its security issue on a third-party \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  website, without naming \uc2 Digital River\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Neither \uc2 Equifax\uc2  nor \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  have been \uc2 Digital River\uc2  customers directly, but Central Source LLC, a joint venture set up by the credit-reporting agencies to run annualcreditreport.com, had a contract to use Fireclick that expired in May 2014, \uc2 Digital River\uc2  said. Annualcreditreport.com is a site where people can check their credit reports with each of the three major firms free once a year.\par \par \uc2 Central Source couldn't be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 That joint venture is likely the reason \uc2 Equifax\uc2  and \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  were still trying to connect to the defunct Fireclick service, Mr. Segura said. "It's the responsibility of whoever owns the website to ensure that all scripts are relevant," he said.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  has blamed failures in its scanning and patch-management systems for a May 2017 data breach that compromised the personal information of 145.5 million consumers. The security issue reported this week was likely due to a similar type of failure.\par \par \uc2 Digital River\uc2  said Fireclick's last clients stopped using the service in late 2015, so there were no clients to notify when it took the Fireclick service down and released the domain.\par \par \uc2 In a statement Friday, \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  said it was aware its Central America site redirected users to download malware. After fixing the issue, \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  scanned its other sites and found no unauthorized access to its systems, the company said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WJCO20171016000058"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020171016edag00011\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Financial markets were unimpressed, sending shares in \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  down as much as 2.4 per cent and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  as much as 1.2 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The two stocks have been among the biggest winners of the "Trump bump" in US equities as investors have piled into the banking sector, hoping that a combination of lower taxes and lighter regulation would boost earnings. Shares in Citi and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  are up 50 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, over the past year.\par \par \uc2 Yet executives caution that many recent developments in Washington have been a hindrance, not a help. Policy gridlock is making corporate America more reluctant to borrow, putting a lid on banks' revenues from lending.\par \par \uc2 "We all would anticipate greater loan growth if there was a little more clarity", said \uc2 John Gerspach\uc2  , Citigroup's chief financial officer, pointing to uncertainty over tax policy. He added, though, that Citi had seen "good pockets of loan growth around the world".\par \par \uc2 Yet the results also highlighted several areas of resilience. \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  delivered a 7 per cent rise in net profits, as the Fed's rises in base rates supported lending profit margins. Improved car lease volume and credit card loan balances also supported revenues at its consumer and small business banking unit.\par \par \uc2 Citi eked out an 8 per cent gain in net income to $4.13bn, although the figures were flattered by the sale of its fixed income \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  unit to the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2 , which led to a $355m pre-tax gain. Conditions have been patchy, meaning institutional clients sat on the sidelines, pushing bond-trading revenues down 27 per cent at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and 16 per cent at Citi.\par \par \uc2 The result also showed that banks are braced for more consumer loans to sour after a long period of benign lending conditions. Citi booked $252m worth of credit losses. \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 's credit costs, meanwhile, were about $200m higher than last year because of higher charge-offs at its card business.\par \par \uc2 Lex page 10\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171013edad0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On the eve of his anointment by the Chinese Communist Party for a second five-year term as China's leader, \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  seems to be the master of all he surveys. He has centralized economic and national-security policy in his office. The military and the police are firmly under control. Legions of corrupt officials\u8212\'20\'14some of them political rivals, others caught brazenly on the take\u8212\'20\'14are in jail. Dissidents and activists have been sidelined or locked up.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Xi's most consequential political battle today has received little attention. As he has tightened his grip on the party and the military, he now faces only one potential set of genuine rivals: China's new class of wealthy entrepreneurs. China's communist leaders have long been known to dread a Soviet-style collapse, but Mr. Xi and his senior colleagues are equally worried about replicating what came in its aftermath: the rise of the Russian oligarchs, who snatched control of state assets and turned themselves into billionaires and pushy political players. Mr. Xi is determined not to let that happen in China.\par \par \uc2 Some of China's new tycoons have challenged the state; others have acquiesced after clashes with the authorities; most have kept their heads down and concentrated on making money. But whether or not the entrepreneurs are taking on Mr. Xi, Mr. Xi has decided to pre-empt any threat by taking the fight to them first.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Xi's campaign to corral the private sector seems to have begun in earnest in June, with the disappearance of the swashbuckling businessman who had become a standard-bearer for local tycoons leading a new wave of aggressive deal-making overseas. \uc2 Wu Xiaohui\uc2 , the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, went the way that communist members who fall afoul of the system do, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-disappearance-of-a-chinese-deal-maker-1497434038"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 vanishing without official explanation}}}\uc2  into the party's extralegal detention system.\par \par \uc2 Only months earlier, Mr. Wu had been leading negotiations to spend $14 billion buying \uc2 Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc\uc2 . before {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-anbang-tells-starwood-it-is-walking-away-1459455942"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the deal collapsed}}}\uc2 . Mr. Wu hasn't been heard from since his detention; no charges have been filed.\par \par \uc2 From a near-standing start in the 1990s, entrepreneurs now account for three-quarters of China's economic output and employ more than 80% of workers in its cities, according to \uc2 Andy Rothman\uc2 , an investment strategist with Matthews Asia in San Francisco. "The Chinese economy has been for the last decade\u8212\'20\'14and will be forever into the future\u8212\'20\'14driven by the private sector. That's not in dispute," said Mr. Rothman. "There's more people in Berkeley, where I live, who believe in Marxist-Leninist theory than in Beijing."\par \par \uc2 But while China's new entrepreneurial class may not believe in Marx, its leaders have other ideas. "If we deviate from or abandon Marxism, our party would lose its soul and direction," Mr. Xi told a meeting of senior party officials in September. That same week, the party and the government issued a joint statement defining for the first time the essential qualities of "Chinese entrepreneurship." At the top was "patriotism."\par \par \uc2 As this year's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-sets-date-for-party-congress-as-xi-looms-even-larger-1504181813"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 party congress}}}\uc2 , which opens Oct. 18 in Beijing, draws near, the conventional wisdom holds that Mr. Xi's central economic challenge is energizing China's sprawling and declining state-owned enterprises, which are clustered in heavy industry and utilities. But this view gets this issue upside down. Unproductive state ventures are hard to reform, but they have always been part of the Chinese system, with their top executives hired and fired by the party.\par \par \uc2 The private sector, however, was born outside of the party's control. To borrow an analogy from the popular geopolitical theory known as the "Thucydides trap," China's entrepreneurs are the rising power destined to battle the established power of the party and the state. "It's been clear from before Xi's time that if entrepreneurs try to use their business networks for political power, the party will quickly cut them down," said Ding Xueliang of the \uc2 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\uc2 . "But the party cannot control everyone in China in the private sector forever."\par \par \uc2 As China's private sector has blossomed, the state has hardened its Leninist core, which dictates that the communist party should face no rival centers of power. Mr. Wu's detention\u8212\'20\'14and the harassment of other rich entrepreneurs\u8212\'20\'14seems to be a taste of the struggles to come between the party and the business class.\par \par \uc2 A former auto dealer who married the granddaughter of the former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Mr. Wu had pulled off some big offshore acquisitions, including the 2014 purchase of New York's famed Waldorf Astoria Hotel. In the 18 months before his fall from grace, his company had outlaid more than $20 billion. His high profile, deep connections and audacious deal-making seem to have helped make him a target for a leadership looking to remind China's newly minted CEO class who was really in charge.\par \par \uc2 Several other tycoons running large private companies fell under clouds around the same time. In July, Mr. Xi blocked Chinese state-owned banks from giving the \uc2 Dalian Wanda Group\uc2 , which owns \uc2 AMC Theatres\uc2 , new loans for expansion abroad. \uc2 Wang Jianlin\uc2 , the company's billionaire chairman, backed out of major offshore deals under government pressure and, after the company's stock price plunged on rumors that he had been banned from leaving China, issued a statement {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wanda-dismisses-reports-chairman-wang-jianlin-cant-leave-china-1503904726"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 denying the travel ban}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Similarly, the billionaire \uc2 Guo Guangchang\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14whose Fosun Group in Shanghai bought the resort operator \uc2 Club M\u233\'00\'E9diterran\u233\'00\'E9e\uc2  and a stake in \uc2 Cirque du Soleil\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14has been forced more than once {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fosuns-guo-guangchang-appears-at-company-event-in-shanghai-1450063834"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 to deny}}}\uc2  that he was in detention after rumors circulated online and the local press. At one point in 2015, Mr. Guo traveled to New York, pointedly posting a photo of himself online to prove he was still at liberty\u8212\'20\'14and in business.\par \par \uc2 Ahead of the party congress, Mr. Xi has had a bruising firsthand experience with what can happen when an entrepreneur goes rogue. From his luxurious apartment in Manhattan, \uc2 Guo Wengui\uc2 , a onetime Beijing property developer, has been bombarding Beijing with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-tycoon-lobs-graft-claims-into-beijing-politics-1493803804"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 lurid disclosures}}}\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14in widely discussed video interviews and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  posts\u8212\'20\'14about alleged top-level corruption and Politburo members who have children out of wedlock. Not all of his sometimes outlandish claims about China's leaders can be independently confirmed, but the exiled entrepreneur's ties to former high officials\u8212\'20\'14notably Ma Jian, a onetime spy chief who is now in jail after a bribery and abuse-of-power probe\u8212\'20\'14lend him some authority.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Guo, who is fleeing charges of corruption in China, had promised further revelations\u8212\'20\'14contained, he has said on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , in "91 folders and 18 videotapes" that he had spirited out of China when he left in 2015. In October, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  blocked his online profile, saying that it had included someone else's personal information without their consent. Then the \uc2 Hudson Institute\uc2 , a Washington think tank, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-fugitive-guo-wenguis-d-c-event-postponed-1507074391"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 postponed an event}}}\uc2  featuring Mr. Guo, who said that he suspected pressure from the Chinese government. (A Hudson Institute spokesman said that the Chinese embassy to the U.S. had complained about the event with Mr. Guo but said that it was canceled because of "poor planning" on the institute's part.)\par \par \uc2 For now, Mr. Guo is an outlier. Few of China's big business leaders\u8212\'20\'14who range from robber barons to genuine visionaries\u8212\'20\'14have dared to challenge the party's leadership head on. For many, their party membership and connections have become paths to cheap bank loans, advancement and enrichment.\par \par \uc2 "The private companies were presented with a very clear choice: You can make money, but you must acknowledge the communist party's ascendancy," said Barry Naughton, an expert on the Chinese economy at the \uc2 University of California, San Diego\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Chinese Communist Party took a long time to declare its love for business. In the early 1980s, a few years after Deng launched his transformational market reforms, the party's constitution still boasted of socialism's "incomparable superiority over the capitalist system." Local officials, nervous about discovering thriving private businesses in their midst, often checked with Deng before allowing them to stay open.\par \par \uc2 The party didn't cross the ideological Rubicon until early in the 21st century, when Chinese leaders realized that they badly needed private business to provide more jobs as the state sector shrank. Jiang Zemin, who led the party from 1989 to 2002, fashioned amendments to party documents to put private business on a stronger political footing. "Entrepreneurs are all builders of socialism with Chinese characteristics," Mr. Jiang declared.\par \par \uc2 Even so, China's leaders remain wary about unbound capitalism. Over the past decade, Chinese officials at all ranks have been forced to attend study sessions about the collapse of the Soviet Union\u8212\'20\'14and about its aftermath, with the rise of a new class of Russian oligarchs enriched by their virtual theft of state assets.\par \par \uc2 Chinese leaders watched in horror as the Soviet Union disintegrated and its assets were privatized. Having seen business threaten to take over the state in Russia, officials in China decided to do the reverse. Over the past two decades, Beijing has tried to colonize the private sector to make sure entrepreneurs stay under control.\par \par \uc2 "The party has been trying to figure out just how long the leash should be," said Jude Blanchette of the Conference Board's China Center for Economics and Business. "Too short, and you stifle growth. Too long, and you lose control."\par \par \uc2 Entrepreneurs were encouraged to join the party, which had long styled itself as a home for workers, soldiers and peasants. In 2016, amid a sharp rise in entrepreneurs' membership, businessmen and women made up more than 8% of the party's 89.5 million members, according to its own figures. A 2015 study by Curtis Milhaupt of Columbia Law School and Wentong Zheng of the \uc2 University of Florida\uc2  College of Law found that 95 of the founders or de facto controllers of China's top 100 private firms and eight of the heads of its top 10 internet companies were or had been members of party-led political organizations.\par \par \uc2 The party "has figured out a way to incorporate the private sector fairly effectively," said Yasheng Huang, a China specialist at MIT. As one lever, he cited the state sector's control of such areas as finance, steel and electricity to exert strong pricing power over business. "There are many economic instruments they can exercise over the private sector."\par \par \uc2 The party's targeting of tycoons hasn't just been over alleged corruption. As tens of billions of dollars have headed offshore in recent years in search of foreign assets, Beijing has feared that a plunge in foreign-exchange reserves would destabilize China's currency. Senior officials also worried that the deal-making frenzy would end the same way that Japan's did in the early 1990s, with huge sums wasted on inflated assets.\par \par \uc2 Beijing has taken particular pains to keep the titans of China's internet industry in line, including \uc2 Robin Li\uc2  at Baidu and especially Jack Ma at Alibaba and Pony Ma at Tencent. The three companies\u8212\'20\'14respectively China's dominant search engine, e-commerce platform and messaging and social-media service\u8212\'20\'14are often known collectively in China by their initials, BAT. In just a few years, thanks to online searches and electronic payments, the companies have become an efficient, real-time storehouse of data that China's pervasive state security apparatus could only have dreamed of obtaining.\par \par \uc2 China's tech giants are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-and-tencent-set-fast-pace-in-mobile-payments-race-1506072602"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 world leaders in mobile payments}}}\uc2 , and they are also working with the government on \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 , handing China's surveillance state more tools, including face recognition. Chinese companies are using AI to try to plan and predict consumer behavior; the government wants to use the same tools to anticipate dissent and head it off. The elimination of cash is making it easier for the government to track payments\u8212\'20\'14and citizens.\par \par \uc2 Baidu and Tencent have both felt the government's wrath recently. In 2016, Baidu {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-issues-new-internet-search-rules-following-baidu-probe-1466920307"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 was investigated}}}\uc2  for selling rankings on its search engine; Tencent was driven to put {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gaming-company-tencent-questioned-over-honor-cuts-kids-play-time-1499173348"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 time limits}}}\uc2  on its top-grossing mobile game after state-media criticism that it was harmfully addictive. Both companies have also been investigated for alleged cybersecurity violations.\par \par \uc2 Jack Ma, the most outspoken and high-profile of the tech-company CEOs, has mostly stayed out of trouble with the authorities. The Alibaba founder likes to say that in China, entrepreneurs should avoid doing business with government officials. "Love them. But don't marry them," he says.\par \par \uc2 Not satisfied with threatening the tech companies, the government {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-pushes-for-a-direct-hand-in-chinas-big-tech-firms-1507758314"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 is now pushing}}}\uc2  companies like Alibaba and Tencent to sell Beijing shares in the companies and provide a seat at the table when business decisions are made. The government would presumably also get a steady flow of dividends from its stake.\par \par \uc2 Despite Mr. Xi's concerns about tycoons, his career should have helped him appreciate the role that business could play in making China\u8212\'20\'14and the party\u8212\'20\'14great again. Between 1985 and 2007, he was posted in Fujian and Zhejiang, two coastal provinces south of Shanghai that are among the most entrepreneurial in China. "I think it is assumed, based on where he has served, that he should have a very good idea of how the private sector works and its importance, but it's hard to see that," said \uc2 Nicholas Lardy\uc2  of the \uc2 Peterson Institute for International Economics\uc2 , a Washington think tank.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Xi's vision hardly seems to be one of unfettered entrepreneurship. Speaking recently about China's private sector, he declared that entrepreneurs owed their country a political duty. Business leaders, he said, should "strengthen self-study, self-education and self-improvement."\par \par \uc2 "They should not feel uncomfortable with this requirement," Mr. Xi added. "The communist party has similar and stricter requirements on its leaders."\par \par \uc2 Mr. McGregor is the author, most recently, of "Asia's Reckoning: China, Japan, and the Fate of U.S. Power in the Pacific Century" (Viking).\par \par \uc2 Related Reading\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-disappearance-of-a-chinese-deal-maker-1497434038"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Disappearance of a Chinese Deal Maker}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cranks-up-heat-on-exiled-tycoon-guo-wengui-1497006242"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 China Cranks Up the Heat on Exiled Tycoon Guo Wengui}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-pushes-for-a-direct-hand-in-chinas-big-tech-firms-1507758314"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Beijing Pushes for a Direct Hand in China's Big Tech Firms}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171013edad005eh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Inaction in Washington has been a boon for municipal-bond investors this year.\par \par \uc2 In the two months after the 2016 election, investors took $27 billion out of muni-bond funds. The fear was that President Donald Trump's agenda for taxes, infrastructure and health care would drive up interest rates, and thus make outstanding bonds less attractive.\par \par \uc2 Washington has made scant policy changes, and those concerns have since abated. In addition, the GOP tax framework leaves the tax-deductibility of municipal bonds intact. In short, little has changed, and investors are again doing what they had done in previous decades: buying munis.\par \par \uc2 "So far this year has been very good for returns for munis, and somewhat unexpectedly," said Jim Colby, senior municipal portfolio manager atVanEck.\par \par \uc2 Also driving up prices: Cities and states have so far issued much less debt than last year, leaving investors hungry for municipal bonds.\par \par \uc2 Though prices have drifted downward slightly over the past month alongside Treasurys, the S&P Municipal Bond Index is back to its pre-election level, 4.4% higher than at the beginning of January.\par \par \uc2 In trading this month, a New York state general-obligation bond carried a yield of 1.2%, compared with 2.1% in December. Yields fall as prices rise.\par \par \uc2 About $28 billion flowed into municipal-bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds from January through September, according to the \uc2 Investment Company Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 These investors are largely shrugging off two potentially disruptive events: multiple ratings downgrades in Hartford, Conn., where the mayor in July hired restructuring advisers; and what amounts to the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy, in Puerto Rico.\par \par \uc2 "Munis had a pretty good year," said J.R. Rieger, managing director of fixed-income index product management at S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. "That's kind of a surprise to me given all the headline headwinds that the muni market is facing."\par \par \uc2 Increasing demand also came from foreign buyers. More than $3 billion flowed into municipal bonds from outside the U.S. in the second quarter, bringing the total amount of munis held by foreign investors to a record $98.6 billion, according to \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  data. With global interest rates still low, munis appeal to foreign institutional investors seeking safe long-dated securities, even though they don't benefit from tax exemptions.\par \par \uc2 Despite high demand in both the U.S. and abroad, munis are in fairly short supply. Municipalities this year have issued $276 billion in new bonds as of last week, down 18% from this time last year, according to \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2 . The state of Massachusetts has sold about $1.7 billion in general-obligation bonds this year, half the amount it had issued by this time last year, according to \uc2 Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board\uc2  data.\par \par \uc2 The drop-off comes as cities and states are doing far fewer refinancing deals this year; many governments typically refinance before a new presidential administration, to head off potential uncertainty, said \uc2 Matt Fabian\uc2 , a partner at Municipal Market \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One of the few hiccups to the rebound in prices this year was in September. Since last month, bond prices have fallen slightly alongside Treasurys after the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  signaled it remained on course to steadily raise interest rates.\par \par \uc2 But that dip barely dented the upward trend in muni prices since January. Some bondholders were relieved after a Trump infrastructure plan that could have diverted the assets of large infrastructure investors away from muni bonds didn't materialize. Given that failure, the inability to repeal the Affordable Care Act and other setbacks for the Trump administration, investors became increasingly confident big changes weren't coming from Washington this year.\par \par \uc2 "As the year has worn on, there has been this understanding that these things, if they happen, they're not going to happen any time soon, and they may not happen at all," said Gary Gildersleeve, partner and portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw480\pich495\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal7200\pichgoal7425

Group-wide revenues improved 2 per cent year on year to $18.2bn.\par \par \uc2 A focus on costs also helped the bottom line. Operating expenses were $233m lower than the same period last year, at $10.2bn.\par \par \uc2 However, Citi reported a lacklustre performance in bond trading, an important source of profits. As the bank had warned in September, a period of calm in financial markets meant institutional clients sat on the sidelines. Citi\u8217\'20\'19s fixed-income revenues dropped 16 per cent cent from last year when a busy trading period followed the UK\u8217\'20\'19s vote for Brexit.\par \par \uc2 Earnings per share came in at $1.42, comfortably exceeding analysts\u8217\'20\'19 forecasts of $1.32.\par \par \uc2 Even though the results were better than analysts had expected, shares in Citi \u8212\'20\'14 the best performing of the big six US banks this year \u8212\'20\'14 fell more than 2 per cent by mid-morning trading in New York.\par \par \uc2 Citi also booked $252m worth of credit losses, primarily at the North America consumer bank, and added $100m to its loan loss reserves because of a series of hurricanes and earthquakes.\par \par \uc2 Steven Chubak, analyst at Nomura Instinet, said the figures \u8220\'20\'1Ccould dampen initial euphoria\u8221\'20\'1D given \u8220\'20\'1Crecent share outperformance\u8221\'20\'1D. Still, he added \u8220\'20\'1Cunderlying revenue and expense trends look solid\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The third-quarter results are the first since Citi\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cinvestor day\u8221\'20\'1D in the summer, its first such event in nine years, at which chief executive \uc2 Michael Corbat\uc2  laid down new financial goals to improve profitability and make payouts to shareholders.\par \par \uc2 After a protracted post-crisis recovery, investors have become more optimistic about Citi\u8217\'20\'19s prospects. The stock has been among the biggest winners of the \u8220\'20\'1CTrump bump\u8221\'20\'1D as investors have piled into the banking sector, hoping for higher earnings on the back of a combination of lower taxes and lighter regulation.\par \par \uc2 Citi shares have gained 26 per cent this year to leave them trading at book value for the first time since 2008.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171012edac007by\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

A period of calm in financial markets sent Citi\u8217\'20\'19s fixed income revenues down 16 per cent cent. The previous year had been supported by the UK\u8217\'20\'19s vote for Brexit, which encouraged clients to trade.\par \par \uc2 Citi\u8217\'20\'19s overall net income improved from $3.84bn a year ago to $4.13bn, although the figure was boosted by a $355m pre-tax gain that the bank booked selling its fixed income \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business to the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The third quarter results are the first since Citi\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cinvestor day\u8221\'20\'1D in the summer, its first such event in nine years, at which chief executive \uc2 Michael Corbat\uc2  laid down new financial goals to improve profitability and make payouts to shareholders.\par \par \uc2 After a protracted post-crisis recovery, investors have become more optimistic about Citi\u8217\'20\'19s prospects. The stock has been among the biggest winners of the \u8220\'20\'1CTrump bump\u8221\'20\'1D as investors have piled into the banking sector, hoping for a bank-friendly combination of lower taxes and lighter regulation.\par \par \uc2 Citi shares are the performing of the big six US banks this year, gaining 26 per cent to leave them trading at book value for the first time since 2008. They ticked up 0.2 per cent in pre-market trade on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Earnings per share came in at $1.42, ahead of analysts\u8217\'20\'19 forecasts of $1.32.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171012edac004s9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Financial markets were unimpressed, sending shares down in \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  3.4 per cent and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  0.9 per cent on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The two stocks have been among the biggest winners of the \u8220\'20\'1CTrump bump\u8221\'20\'1D in US equities as investors have piled into the banking sector, hoping that a combination of lower taxes and lighter regulation would boost earnings. Shares in Citi and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  are up 47 per cent and 41 per cent respectively over the past year.\par \par \uc2 Yet executives caution that many recent developments in Washington have been a hindrance, not a help. Policy gridlock is making corporate America more reluctant to borrow, putting a lid on the revenues banks produce from lending.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe all would anticipate greater loan growth if there was a bit more clarity\u8221\'20\'1D, said \uc2 John Gerspach\uc2 , Citigroup\u8217\'20\'19s chief financial officer, pointing to uncertainty over tax policy. He added, though, that Citi had seen \u8220\'20\'1Cgood pockets of loan growth around the world\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Christine Lagarde\uc2 , IMF managing director, also called on Thursday for US policymakers to press ahead with tax reform. \u8220\'20\'1CThe sooner it goes through, the better,\u8221\'20\'1D she told Bloomberg TV.\par \par \uc2 Yet the bank results also highlighted several areas of resilience. \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  delivered a 7 per cent rise in net profits, as the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s increases in base rates supported lending profit margins. Improved car lease volume and credit card loan balances also supported revenues at its consumer and small business banking division.\par \par \uc2 Citi eked out an 8 per cent gain in net income to $4.13bn \u8212\'20\'14 although the figures were flattered by the sale of its fixed income \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  business to the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2 , which allowed it to book a $355m pre-tax gain.\par \par \uc2 Conditions have been patchy on Wall Street, particularly compared with the Brexit-boosted period a year earlier. Calm in financial markets meant institutional clients sat on the sidelines \u8212\'20\'14 pushing bond trading revenues down 27 per cent at \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  and 16 per cent at Citi.\par \par \uc2 The results also showed that the US banks, which have piled into credit card lending in recent months to offset ultra-low interest rates, are braced for more consumer loans to sour after a long period of benign lending conditions.\par \par \uc2 Citi booked $252m worth of credit losses, primarily at its North American consumer bank. It added $100m to its loan loss reserves because of a series of hurricanes and earthquakes.\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s credit costs, meanwhile, were about $200m higher than last year because of higher charge-offs at its card business.\par \par \uc2 Still, \uc2 Marianne Lake\uc2 , JPMorgan\u8217\'20\'19s chief financial officer, said the increase did not reflect an underlying deterioration but was a result of the bank reaching \u8220\'20\'1Ca little deeper\u8221\'20\'1D into riskier customers. \uc2 Chris Kotowski\uc2 , analyst at Oppenheimer, added he was still \u8220\'20\'1Cnot concerned\u8221\'20\'1D about credit quality, as default metrics remain near historic lows.\par \par \uc2 Areas of strength at Citi included consumer banking in Latin America, where the bank is investing heavily in its large Mexico division, and equities trading, a business it is also trying to expand. Group-wide revenues improved 2 per cent year on year to $18.2bn.\par \par \uc2 A focus on costs also helped the bottom line. Operating expenses were $233m lower than the same period last year, at $10.2bn.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171012edac0093t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

It is the 15th most profitable business in the FTSE 100, according to Bloomberg data, earning a return on equity last year of 34 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Shares in \uc2 TransUnion\uc2 , once owned by the billionaire Pritzker family, have more than doubled since its launch on the stock market two years ago.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2 , too, was until recently an investor darling. The Atlanta-based company more than doubled revenues in the 12 years \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  spent at the helm. He stood aside last month after the data breach scandal caused its shares to drop as much as 35 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers say the model is not working for consumers. John Kennedy, a Republican on the Senate banking committee, likened it to a restaurant that charges to stop waiters spitting in food.\par \par \uc2 "You offer me a premium service to make sure the information you collect on me is accurate," he told Mr Smith on Capitol Hill last week. He added: "You can't run your business without me. My data is the product you sell."\par \par \uc2 Ms Warren and her colleague Brian Schatz have introduced a bill, the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation Act, that aims to give customers more control over their data.\par \par \uc2 The law would prevent \uc2 Equifax\uc2  and its peers charging customers to "freeze" access to their credit files. At present, depending on the state, the companies can charge $5 or $10 for the service, which prevents third parties from accessing individuals' data.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  itself, stung by criticism it was slow to respond to the hack, is making the freezes free and in his testimony to Congress, Mr Smith called on \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  and \uc2 Experian\uc2  to do the same.\par \par \uc2 Experian\uc2  responded by saying that while it was "looking at broader solutions that can help consumers", this should not "be done based on crisis-mode responses from \uc2 Equifax\uc2 ".\par \par \uc2 Even so, such a reform is likely to be manageable for the industry, given it makes most of its money not by charging consumers for freezes but from the companies that buy the data. Charles Gabriel, who runs policy analysis group Capital Alpha, said free freezes were "seen by investors as where the industry seems already heading, anyway".\par \par \uc2 More far-reaching changes are also on the horizon, however.\par \par \uc2 Patrick McHenry, a Republican, is bringing forward legislation to encourage US tax authorities to streamline how they share income data. That could make the financial industry less reliant on the credit reporting companies.\par \par \uc2 Other suggestions in Congress range from a ban on prospective employers assessing candidates' credit history to restrictions on insurance companies using it to determine premiums. Some senators have suggested consumers should have the right to "opt in" before \uc2 Equifax\uc2  and its rivals can deal in information about them.\par \par \uc2 The industry is stepping up efforts to defend its interests.\par \par \uc2 TransUnion\uc2 , for instance, has hired the Republican lobbying firm CGCN to work on "issues affecting data security, privacy and cyber security".\par \par \uc2 "Don't let this crisis generate legislation or regulations driven by panic," said Mr Ellman. "We would hope they'd take a step back."\par \par \uc2 The extent of political support for more radical reform is unclear. Even campaigners are cautious about their prospects.\par \par \uc2 "Legislation moves slowly at the best of times," said \uc2 John Breyault\uc2  of the \uc2 National Consumers League\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For now at least, Wall Street is betting that \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's two rivals should emerge largely unscathed. While shares in \uc2 TransUnion\uc2  and \uc2 Experian\uc2  dropped about 13 per cent and 6 per cent respectively after \uc2 Equifax\uc2  disclosed the data breach, they have since recovered.\par \par \uc2 The companies are here to stay, said Ken Fleming, director at Standard & Poor's, not least because their corporate clients still find the service valuable.\par \par \uc2 For instance, \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , which stand behind US residential mortgages, tend to require credit information from all three agencies before they sign off on a loan.\par \par \uc2 "The barriers to entry are fairly high," Mr Fleming said. "And they serve a real need for the lenders."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171012edac000by\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The group, started as a fund management company by three young graduates in 2000, has expanded rapidly.\par \par \uc2 Octopus Group's six divisions include investment management, venture capital, property lending, renewable energy generation, investing in healthcare and fintech. It now has 160,000 customers and is one of the fastest-growing private businesses in the UK. The company says that in the 10-year period to April 2017 revenue for the group grew at a compound annual growth rate of 34 per cent.\par \par \uc2 Simon Rogerson\uc2  and \uc2 Christopher Hulatt\uc2  were just 25 and 23 when they founded the business along with Guy Myles, who left in 2014.\par \par \uc2 "There are 23m households in the UK and we want to be in every one of them," says Mr Rogerson, chief executive. "We want to be a brand people feel so strongly about that they will recommend us to friends and family."\par \par \uc2 Revenue in the year to April 2016 was \u163\'00\'A3272m with \u163\'00\'A3127m post-tax profit. In 2006, the group earned revenue of \u163\'00\'A37m and made \u163\'00\'A3304,000 profit after tax.\par \par \uc2 The healthcare division builds care homes and luxury retirement homes - aimed at people who have cash to spend after selling their houses. It also develops hospitals and special educational needs schools.\par \par \uc2 The targets for expansion are carefully chosen for being in sectors or areas where the customer experience has been poor, giving Octopus the opportunity to offer a better service.\par \par \uc2 "If you ask people for their favourite companies there will not be any in financial services, healthcare or energy," says Mr Rogerson.\par \par \uc2 He says the secret to his company's success is its focus on people. Octopus has developed a reward system for staff based on customer service and teamwork as well as financial results Mr Rogerson believes Octopus has been able to compete with bigger competitors by treating customers better.\par \par \uc2 Octopus has become the third-largest owner of renewable energy assets in the UK. It is not the cheapest energy provider, but eschews the tactics of the UK's largest six energy suppliers, which usually offer low rates to new customers before switching them to more expensive tariffs when the deals expire.\par \par \uc2 "At the end of 12 months they will stick the price up. It is not OK. We will never do that," says Mr Rogerson.\par \par \uc2 Octopus Energy has 115,000 customers and there is "zero friction" for a customer who wishes to switch supplier and change to them, he claims.\par \par \uc2 All Octopus Group staff - the company now employs more than 500 - have shares and the founders retain a majority stake.\par \par \uc2 Octopus Ventures\uc2  manages \u163\'00\'A3650m and has invested in \b \highlight22\uc2 natural language processing\b0 \highlight\uc2  company Evi, predictive keyboard maker Swiftkey and AI video start-up Magic Pony, sold to \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  respectively. Octopus also backed property website \uc2 Zoopla\uc2 , from which it has now exited.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr Rogerson says Octopus is not intending to float or seek outside investors itself.\par \par \uc2 "We are not going to list this business or sell this business. You cannot invest for the long term as a listed business. Investors do not have the patience. A listed business is run for its shareholders. You cannot be run in the interest of customers and staff."\par \par \uc2 As for the name, Octopus was chosen simply because it stood out. "It had a 100 per cent name recall," says Mr Rogerson, who worked for \uc2 Mercury Asset Management\uc2  before he decided to set up his own business. "Most people call investment companies after planets or gods. There is not much humility," he notes with a smile. "We wanted to be different."\par \par \uc2 Octopus\par \par \uc2 In detail\par \par \uc2 Octopus Investments\uc2  , the UK fund management business; Octopus Healthcare , which develops and owns healthcare assets including GP surgeries, care homes and retirement housing; \uc2 Octopus Ventures\uc2  , a London and New York-based venture capital firm focused on early stage businesses; Octopus Energy , a renewable energy supplier; Octopus Property , which provides finance on residential and commercial property; and Octopus Labs , which focuses on financial technology.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171012edac0005m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It has removed the vendor's code from its webpage.\par \par \uc2 Equifax systems weren't compromised, the company said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 This latest cyber issue emerged five weeks after Equifax {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 disclosed a massive hack}}}\uc2  that compromised vital personal information for potentially 145.5 million Americans.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-ceo-richard-smith-to-retire-following-massive-data-breach-1506431571"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Following that}}}\uc2 , the company's chief executive, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-top-equifax-executives-to-retire-1505510863"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 as well as its chief information and security officers}}}\uc2 , retired.\par \par \uc2 The source of this massive hack was a bug in the company's online dispute portal. That dispute portal wasn't affected by this more recent issue, Equifax said.\par \par \uc2 Equifax shares fell nearly 3% at one point Thursday amid reports of a security problem and closed down 1.5% for the day.\par \par \uc2 The malicious content was discovered earlier this week by security researcher Randy Abrams as he tried to examine his own credit report on the Equifax website.\par \par \uc2 The problem was that Equifax's site was delivering fraudulent Adobe Flash updates to some visitors who tried to obtain free credit reports. The updates, while appearing to be a new version of \uc2 Adobe Systems Inc\uc2 .'s widely used software were fake, said Mr. Abrams.\par \par \uc2 If installed, the updates would likely install malicious "adware" on the user's computer, he said. "They just want to hijack your browser and redirect it to disreputable sites," Mr. Abrams said of the adware creators.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Abrams noted the problem {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://randy-abrams.blogspot.com/2017/10/new-equifax-website-compromise.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in a blog post}}}\uc2  and this was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/equifax-website-hacked-again-this-time-to-redirect-to-fake-flash-update/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 later reported}}}\uc2  on by website Ars Technica. Mr. Abrams later surmised that the problem likely stemmed from a third-party \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  website used on the Equifax website. Equifax confirmed this on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The link Equifax has taken down is on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.equifax.com/CreditReportAssistance/?/CreditReportAssistance"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 one of its pages}}}\uc2  that allows certain consumers, including those who have received notice that they have been denied for credit, to get a free or discounted credit report\par \par \uc2 Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Robert McMillan at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Related\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/key-house-republican-plans-bill-to-rein-in-credit-bureaus-after-equifax-hack-1507802400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 GOP Bill Would Boost Checks on Credit Firms}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-ag-eric-schneiderman-probing-deloitte-hack-1507815035?tesla=y"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 New York AG Probing Deloitte Hack}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20171013edac0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Terms it has asked for include seniority over other shareholders, IPO blocking rights, and multiple liquidation preferences that guarantee a return for SoftBank, potentially at the expense of other shareholders. It also tends to go after stakes of 20% to 40%, that provide it with a lot of influence.\par \par \uc2 "If you have a business that is on a growth trajectory that is repeatable and fast, then money like this enables you to accelerate and globalize it faster and experiment," said Michael Eisenberg, whose venture firm Aleph has a stake in WeWork Cos., which received a $4.4 billion investment from SoftBank in August. "If your business has issues either in management or unit economics it's a buy-time setup, which is a double-edged sword," he added.\par \par \uc2 A SoftBank representative declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Son speaks of a grand vision of a coming "information revolution" stretching from \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to the internet-of-things to robotics and beyond. And he's willing to spend big to see it come to pass.\par \par \uc2 This year Vision Fund has announced 11 deals, in addition to 16 done by SoftBank proper during the same time. These have included some of the largest investments on record in venture-backed startups, such as the WeWork funding and a $5 billion round with ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing Technology Co. Meantime, Mr. Son also is negotiating a $10 billion investment in \uc2 Uber Technologies Inc\uc2 ., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-shareholders-divided-over-softbanks-investment-offer-1505409810"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Wall Street Journal has reported}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Of course, operating with such a mammoth fund affords SoftBank the ability to take bigger risks.\par \par \uc2 That makes it attractive to entrepreneurs who say that pressure to show profitability may be shortsighted when there's a large market to pursue.\par \par \uc2 "The Vision fund fits within certain groups of companies where they are going to take very large losses in the next few years, as they try to figure out how to massively scale," Primary's Mr. Sun said.\par \par \uc2 By contrast public market investors have been skeptical of unprofitable tech companies, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/snap-blue-apron-shake-confidence-in-startup-valuations-1501585201"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 punishing newly public stocks }}}\uc2 like \uc2 Snap Inc\uc2 . and Blue Apron Holdings.\par \par \uc2 Instead of belt-tightening ahead of an IPO, companies that take SoftBank's money would be much more free to invest in growth and experiment, say people who have listened to the pitch.\par \par \uc2 Unlike many other growth investors, Vision Fund is open to long holding periods. Mr. Son said on one call with analysts that the fund would "have a policy to exit in some tens of years."\par \par \uc2 Rob Frohwein\uc2 , founder and chief executive of online lending startup \uc2 Kabbage Inc\uc2 ., which just{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-bets-250-million-on-small-business-lender-kabbage-1501756200"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  raised $250 million from SoftBank}}}\uc2 , said that SoftBank takes a flexible view of IPO timelines.\par \par \uc2 "If it's in the best interest for the company to go public 10 years from now, it's fine," Mr. Frohwein said of SoftBank's attitude. In cases when an IPO is primarily a fundraising event, he added, "They'd be more than happy to find another way to provide that capital."\par \par \uc2 Not having to worry about an IPO has particular value to consumer-focused startups in sectors such as transportation, real estate, insurance and food. They often require the kind of spending that public markets are sometimes reluctant to support.\par \par \uc2 "It's very appealing to have the support of such a deep pocketed investor," said \uc2 Adam Valkin\uc2 , managing director at \uc2 General Catalyst Partners\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  has also snatched up shares from existing shareholders. This helps alleviate the worries of early-stage investors who don't want to be tied up in startups for decades, and gives founders a chance to make some money even as they drive their startups to grow even larger.\par \par \uc2 WeWork's shareholders are selling about $1.3 billion in existing stock to SoftBank via its recent deal, according to a person familiar with the situation. \uc2 Social Finance Inc\uc2 ., also known as SoFi, conducted a secondary sale in conjunction with an investment from SoftBank and Silver Lake earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 WeWork didn't have a specific IPO timeline before SoftBank invested, according to the person, but the new capital moves that goal post further out.\par \par \uc2 Getting a SoftBank investment may kick an IPO down the road, but it also resets expectations for the size of the exit. Adds Spencer Lazar, partner at General Catalyst: "It sets the bar higher for an ultimate exit."\par \par \uc2 Write to Yuliya Chernova at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:yuliya.chernova@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 yuliya.chernova@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171012edac0005o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

It's Complicated\par \par \uc2 Now that the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  is clamping down on payday lenders, will banks step in to take their place?\par \par \uc2 In the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-federal-rule-clamps-down-on-payday-loans-1507221844"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 rule it unveiled last week}}}\uc2 , the agency sent a mixed message on that question. The CFPB effectively banned one type of bank loan: deposit-advance products, which were common before banks largely abandoned them due to 2013 guidelines issued by banking regulators. But the CFPB also exempted many small lenders from a core requirement of the rule\u8212\'20\'14having to verify that borrowers can repay the loans\u8212\'20\'14leaving the door open to community banks and credit unions to try to fill the void in the market.\par \par \uc2 Further complicating the equation, the CFPB rule's release caused the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2  to rescind its 2013 guidelines that drove banks out of the market. Many observers interpreted the OCC's action as going against the CFPB's rule.\par \par \uc2 Reflecting the complexity, reactions from the financial industry have also been mixed, and it might be awhile before a consensus is reached. One important consideration is whether small lenders will be able to make a profit on short-term loans. Many of the details of how the rule is implemented will depend on the Trump administration's plans for the CFPB's leadership once Director \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2  leaves office. While his term runs until July, many believe the Obama appointee will leave soon to run for Ohio governor.\par \par \uc2 Small loans' thin margins mean they are profitable for banks if they can be offered cheaply. The 2013 guidance from the OCC and \uc2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\uc2 . forced lenders to verify whether borrowers could repay the loans. That, combined with low interest rates, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-want-a-piece-of-the-payday-loan-pie-1495281601"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 made the loans costlier and less attractive for lenders}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 With the new rule, set to go into effect in the summer of 2019, the CFPB "has reiterated its earlier view that banks can play an important role in meeting the needs of small-dollar borrowers," said Virginia O'Neill, head of regulatory compliance at the \uc2 American Bankers Association\uc2 . Credit unions have also welcomed the CFPB's step, saying it has removed some obstacles for them.\par \par \uc2 Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said the CFPB should have left deposit-advance loans outside the rule's coverage, adding the regulator "whiffed at an opportunity to provide assistance to the millions of Americans experiencing financial hardship."\par \par \uc2 The CFPB makes an exception to the underwriting requirement for lenders that make 2,500 or fewer short-term loans per year and derive no more than 10% of their revenue from such loans. That includes many community banks. The rule also allows loans that generally meet the parameters of "payday alternative loans" authorized by the \uc2 National Credit Union Administration\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nick Bourke\uc2 , director of consumer finance at nonprofit group \uc2 Pew Charitable Trusts\uc2 , said bank and credit-union regulators must now create clear guidelines to help these lenders make small consumer loans safely and profitably. "Banks and credit unions have shown a willingness to serve these customers with small installment loans, and they can do it at prices that are six times lower than payday loans."\par \par \uc2 Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond\par \par \uc2 Exclusive: Key House Republican Plans Bill to Rein In Credit Bureaus After \uc2 Equifax\uc2  Hack\par \par \uc2 By Andrew Ackerman\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A top House Republican is moving to boost federal oversight of credit-reporting companies, the first broad legislative effort to rein in the industry in response to the massive hack disclosed by \uc2 Equifax Inc\uc2 . last month.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina plans to introduce a bill on Thursday that is expected to require the companies to submit to regular federal cybersecurity reviews. The bill also would require each of the three major credit firms\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 Equifax\uc2 , \uc2 Experian PLC\uc2  and TransUnion\u8212\'20\'14to phase out their use of Social Security numbers to verify consumers' identities by 2020.\par \par \uc2 The measure reflects efforts by lawmakers to bring federal oversight to cybersecurity at credit-reporting firms. It comes after a series of hearings in the House and Senate last week featuring former Equifax Chief Executive \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2 . Mr. Smith repeatedly apologized for the hack and said the company didn't initially understand its severity.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McHenry's sponsorship of the legislation is significant. As a deputy GOP whip, he holds significant sway among House Republicans. The bill is an important starting point for the \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  as it considers a legislative response.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Equifax\uc2  hack "exposed a major shortcoming in our nation's cybersecurity laws and Congress must act," Mr. McHenry said in a written statement.\par \par \uc2 Representatives of the three credit-reporting firms didn't respond to requests for comment. A person familiar with their thinking said the companies support some aspects of the legislation, including the heightened supervision.\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  disclosed last month that data belonging to about 145.5 million Americans was potentially compromised by hackers who began digging through its computer network this spring. The hack remained undetected until an internal security team discovered the breach in late July.\par \par \uc2 The attack, which is being probed by the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2 , is one of the most significant data breaches ever given the scope of the information disclosed: names, addresses, birthdays and Social Security numbers. Customers and regulators have raised questions on whether \uc2 Equifax\uc2  took sufficient measures to protect such sensitive information.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith expressed support for the idea of phasing out the use of Social Security numbers, saying policy makers might need to think about how secure the numbers are and if they are the best identifiers going forward.\par \par \uc2 The move to replace Social Security numbers as a form of identification is in its early stages, but also has the support of the Trump administration. Rob Joyce, the White House's cybersecurity coordinator, said at a conference last week that the Social Security number had "outlived its usefulness" and that the current system was "untenable." The White House has launched a working group to explore reducing government use of Social Security numbers to verify people's identities, a senior administration official said last week.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Equifax\uc2  hack is viewed as far more serious than past data breaches at private companies because people's Social Security numbers and birthdays cannot be changed after they are compromised, unlike passwords or credit card numbers.\par \par \uc2 Experts have for years warned about the vulnerability of the Social Security number and urged government entities and businesses to shift toward other means of personal authentication. The \uc2 National Institute of Standards and Technology\uc2 , a government agency, in June revised its guidelines for best practices for digital identity verification, excluding the Social Security number entirely.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McHenry's legislation leaves it up to the companies to formulate a more-modern method of identification, in an effort to spur the companies to innovate, according to a summary of the legislation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 The legislation doesn't specify which federal agency will inspect cybersecurity at the companies. Rather, the bill leaves it up to a panel of bank regulators, the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council, to designate one of the federal banking agencies as the future supervisor of the three major credit-reporting companies. The council, whose members include the Federal Reserve and the \uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 , also would set uniform cybersecurity supervision and examination procedures, according to the summary.\par \par \uc2 Another plank of the bill aims to set a more streamlined system for so-called credit freezes, which prevent a new creditor from accessing a consumer's credit report and block anyone from opening a new line of credit in the name of the consumer who enacted the freeze. The provision would require the companies to provide free credit freezes for certain groups of consumers, including the victims of identity theft, minors and people older than 65.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Survey: \uc2 Kevin Warsh\uc2  Seen as Trump's Most Likely Pick to Lead Fed\par \par \uc2 By Harriet Torry\par \par \uc2 Economists see former Fed governor \uc2 Kevin Warsh\uc2  as the most likely to be nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the Federal Reserve, according to a Wall Street Journal survey.\par \par \uc2 Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Fed governor Jerome Powell ran not far behind as the second and third mostly likely picks to run the central bank after Ms. Yellen's current term ends in early February.\par \par \uc2 Business and academic economists surveyed saw a 28% probability that Mr. Trump would choose Mr. Warsh, a 22% probability of Ms. Yellen winning a second term and a 21% probability of Mr. Powell getting the nod.\par \par \uc2 The results come after The Wall Street Journal reported in late September that Mr. Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had separately interviewed Mr. Warsh and Mr. Powell for the top Fed job, and after the president said he would make a decision within three weeks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warsh, a former \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  executive who served on the Fed's board of governors from 2006 to 2011, has expressed skepticism of the central bank's policy and communications, criticized its asset-purchase programs and accused officials of "trying to fine-tune the economy."\par \par \uc2 He was a member of Mr. Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of business leaders that disbanded in August in protest over what they said was Mr. Trump's failure to sufficiently condemn racism.\par \par \uc2 "Warsh has muscle memory of the crisis, is well-known by Republicans on the Hill and knows the president," Diane Swonk of DS Economics said in the survey, in which she assigned Mr. Warsh a 55% probability of becoming the next Fed chairman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell, who joined the Fed's board of governors in 2012, has emerged as a reliable ally of Ms. Yellen's on monetary policy, while also calling for easing some of the bank rules put in place following the financial crisis. This puts him largely in sync with Mr. Trump's positions favoring low interest rates and financial deregulation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell was a partner at the \uc2 Carlyle Group\uc2 , a private-equity firm, from 1997 to 2005 and a lawyer and investment banker in New York. He served as an undersecretary and assistant secretary for domestic finance at the U.S. Treasury from 1990 to 1993.\par \par \uc2 "I expect it will either be Powell as a continuity pick or Warsh as a disruptor," Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said in the WSJ survey. He assigned a 40% probability to Mr. Warsh and a 35% probability to Mr. Powell.\par \par \uc2 The survey gave the respondents a list of six names and asked them to assign to each a probability he or she would be nominated as Fed leader, and there was an option of "someone not on this list." The economists were asked to submit estimates that would add up to 100%.\par \par \uc2 Ranking below the top three were Mr. Trump's top economic adviser and former Wall Street executive \uc2 Gary Cohn\uc2 , Stanford University economist John Taylor, former BB&T Bank Chief Executive John Allison or another name not on the list.\par \par \uc2 Economists assigned Mr. Cohn an 11% probability, Mr. Taylor an 8% probability and Mr. Allison a 5% probability. They put the chance of Mr. Trump picking someone not on the list at 6%. Rounding in the survey meant the total of the responses added up to 101%, rather than 100%.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in an interview in July that he was considering nominating Mr. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, to become Fed chairman. But Mr. Cohn's public criticism of Mr. Trump's response to the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., made it unlikely the president would nominate him to the position, people familiar with the president's thinking told the Journal in September.\par \par \uc2 Market expectations of Mr. Trump's choice differ. Early Wednesday, Mr. Powell was the market front-runner with a 46% probability, according to PredictIt, a New Zealand-based online prediction market. Mr. Warsh had a 25% probability, Ms. Yellen had 14% and Mr. Cohn had 8%.\par \par \uc2 Nearly three in four economists polled in last month's survey said Ms. Yellen should be nominated for a second term as Fed chairwoman. Around two-thirds of the same economists viewed Mr. Cohn as qualified to be chairman.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Yellen hasn't commented on her intentions beyond saying she intends to serve out her current term as chairwoman, which ends Feb. 3, 2018. She said at a Sept. 20 press conference that she hadn't met with Mr. Trump since earlier in the year. The two met for about 15 minutes in the Oval Office in February. Her term as a governor extends until 2024, so she could stay on at the Fed regardless of Mr. Trump's pick for Fed chief.\par \par \uc2 The Journal surveyed 59 economists Oct. 6-10 in this month's poll, although not every economist answered every question.\par \par \uc2 Era of Public-Company Deregulation Gets Off to a Modest Start\par \par \uc2 By Dave Michaels\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14A government overhaul of regulations that are blamed for discouraging many hot startups from going public is getting off to a modest start.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , which under the Trump administration is seeking to juice up the market for initial share sales, voted unanimously Wednesday to approve a proposal that would simplify some disclosures that public companies provide to investors. A Republican SEC commissioner called it an "incremental change."\par \par \uc2 "Today's amendments are not an exercise in slash-and-burn clear-cutting," said SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar, a Republican on the three-member body. "They are incremental changes\u8212\'20\'14a snip here, a snip there."\par \par \uc2 Under the plan approved Wednesday and put out for public comment, companies would no longer have to seek regulatory approval to withhold less significant contract information from filings that they believe are still commercially sensitive.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's rule proposal also would allow companies to omit information about executives or workers that they believe is private, such as Social Security numbers, addresses or dates of birth.\par \par \uc2 Under current rules, companies often first submit these records as parts of larger filings to the SEC, while asking the staff's permission to keep private data out of the public domain.\par \par \uc2 The SEC, which last month disclosed a hack of its corporate-filing system, is trying to limit the volume of information it receives that isn't material to investors but could be damaging to individuals or companies if disclosed.\par \par \uc2 Other aspects of the SEC's plan would simplify narrative disclosures that investors use to better understand a public company's financial performance and future prospects. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump administration appointee, said the proposal doesn't get rid of any information that investors need to make buy or sell decisions.\par \par \uc2 Many of the plan's ideas are modest and technical. For instance, companies would no longer have to include a comparison of the prior year's earnings and other performance metrics from the two prior years. Instead, firms could simply discuss their performance during the two most recent years.\par \par \uc2 "The proposed amendments are designed to discourage repetitive and immaterial disclosures, and make disclosure more accessible," William Hinman, the SEC's director of corporation finance, said at the meeting where commissioners approved the plan.\par \par \uc2 The SEC's vote on Wednesday opens a 60-day public-comment period during which investors and other parties can provide feedback. The three-member commission would have to vote again in the future to complete the changes.\par \par \uc2 CFTC to Delay Decision on Swap Dealer Registration Threshold\par \par \uc2 By Gabriel T. Rubin\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON\u8212\'20\'14The U.S.'s derivatives regulator plans to delay rules that would require more firms to register as swaps dealers, a move that buys more time without stricter oversight for energy and agricultural companies that use the products to hedge risks.\par \par \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo announced the move Wednesday at a House committee hearing, saying the agency needed more time to consider whether it should narrow the number of firms that must register as dealers. "The goal is to get the right result, not a rushed result," he said.\par \par \uc2 Swaps and other derivatives contributed to the financial crisis, including the collapse of \uc2 American International Group Inc\uc2 . In response, the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law gave the CFTC authority to regulate the bulk of the multitrillion-dollar swaps market. Dodd-Frank mandated that the threshold for registering with the CFTC as a swaps dealer, which comes with expensive margin and capital requirements, be lowered to $3 billion in notional value from $8 billion.\par \par \uc2 The lower threshold was meant to go into effect next year, after already being delayed once during the Obama administration. This delay will be the last one, Mr. Giancarlo said, adding he expects the CFTC to make a final rule on the matter during the first half of 2018.\par \par \uc2 The CFTC will vote in the coming weeks on a one-year delay, Mr. Giancarlo said. Given the Republican majority on the three-member commission, it will likely pass.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giancarlo, a Republican, said the CFTC must do more market analysis of the firms that could be affected before reaching a final decision on a threshold\u8212\'20\'14the same rationale used by his Democratic predecessor Timothy Massad when he delayed a decision the first time in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Commissioner Russ Behnam criticized Mr. Giancarlo's announcement, saying the additional delay would "only serve to prolong uncertainty for market participants and create market risk."\par \par \uc2 The commission's third member, Republican Commissioner Brian Quintenz, also criticized the uncertainty surrounding the decision, and said he supports keeping the threshold at $8 billion permanently.\par \par \uc2 Firms that don't primarily use swaps for speculative purposes have been the key critics of a lower threshold, saying it would hamper their ability to hedge against commodity-price fluctuations. Energy and agricultural companies, as well as large purchasers of commodities such as airlines, argue that their use of swaps is a risk-management technique that doesn't present systemic risk, unlike with larger financial firms that use swaps for speculative purposes.\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro Short: Chief Counsel at Banking Regulator to Retire\par \par \uc2 Amy Friend, chief counsel at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is stepping down Nov. 11, the agency said Wednesday. Ms. Friend had served as OCC's top lawyer since 2013, a period when the agency adopted stricter banking rules, some of which have been criticized by the agency's acting head since May, \uc2 Keith Noreika\uc2 . She was a key player in the agency's recent push to consider offering federal charters to fintech firms. Before becoming chief counsel, she was a congressional staffer who worked on the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. The OCC said Karen Solomon, a deputy chief counsel at the agency, would serve as acting chief counsel while the agency searches for a successor to Ms. Friend.\par \par \uc2 IMF Identifies Nine Big Banks Likely to Struggle With Profitability\par \par \uc2 By Josh Zumbrun\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  said some of the world's largest financial institutions\u8212\'20\'14including \uc2 Deutsche Bank AG\uc2 , \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Barclays PLC\uc2  and a few Japanese institutions\u8212\'20\'14could struggle in coming years to remain sufficiently profitable.\par \par \uc2 "About a third of banks by assets may struggle to achieve sustainable profitability, underscoring ongoing challenges and medium-term vulnerabilities," the IMF said, referring to the world's most important financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 The IMF's critique of the banks came in its biannual Global Financial Stability Report, released Wednesday as finance ministers and central bankers from 189 countries gather in Washington for the annual meetings of the IMF and the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is unusual for a body like the IMF to identify banks by name. The report named nine financial institutions in all, Besides \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 , Deutsche and \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , it also named \uc2 Soci\u233\'00\'E9t\u233\'00\'E9 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale\uc2 , Italy's \uc2 UniCredit S.p.A\uc2 ., the U.K.'s \uc2 Standard Chartered PLC\uc2  and Japan's \uc2 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group\uc2 , \uc2 Mizuho Financial Group\uc2  and \uc2 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\uc2  as likely to deliver subpar profits.\par \par \uc2 All nine declined to comment on the report.\par \par \uc2 "Institutions that are not profitable might not be able to generate enough capital in the future should adverse shocks hit," \uc2 Tobias Adrian\uc2 , director of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, told reporters. "It might become a financial stability risk not to be profitable."\par \par \uc2 The IMF said the consensus among private-sector bank-industry analysts was for a return on equity of less than 8% for each of those nine banks in 2019. In previous research, the IMF has said that banks' cost of equity\u8212\'20\'14that is the return stock investors expect on their holdings\u8212\'20\'14is at least 8%. Banks need to earn above this threshold to remain consistently profitable and otherwise may face difficulty building capital for a rainy day, the IMF said.\par \par \uc2 Regulators and international policy makers are typically circumspect about questioning the profitability of specific banks, often preferring to speak more generally out of concern they could weaken institutions that are already vulnerable and risk destabilizing the global financial system. But the global economy is in a broad upswing, and financial markets have been broadly supportive, creating a window for the IMF to speak more boldly.\par \par \uc2 The report looked at the 30 international banks the \uc2 Financial Stability Board\uc2 , the international regulatory body, has deemed to be global systemically important banks, based on their size and complexity and potential ability to wreak havoc across the global financial system should they stumble. All told, the 30 institutions hold more than $47 trillion in assets, a sum representing more than one-third of global banking loans and assets.\par \par \uc2 Some of the IMF's views are already conventional thinking on Wall Street. \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 's stock, for example, trades at less than half of its book value, or net worth, and has traded well below this level since 2010. This suggests investors don't believe it will deliver returns that create value in the long run.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  has struggled to maintain profits during a prolonged turnaround hobbled by high legal fees and technology costs and capital constraints on dominant businesses such as fixed-income trading. Another challenge for the German lender is that retail banking in its home market is less profitable than that business is for many big banks elsewhere. \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  raised $8.5 billion earlier this year by selling shares, putting pressure on executives to prove they can use the fresh capital to boost profits.\par \par \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  investors have grown more confident in the bank's outlook. Over the past year, the shares have risen more than 50%, almost three times the gains of the broader market. The stock also is trading near its book value, or net worth; it last hit that level in September 2008. And in June, the \uc2 U.S. Federal Reserve\uc2  gave \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  a green light to return nearly $19 billion in capital to investors through higher dividend payouts and increased share buybacks.\par \par \uc2 The British banks named in the report, \uc2 Barclays\uc2  and Standard Chartered, have been shedding asset and business lines to become more profitable. Italian \uc2 UniCredit\uc2 , over the past year, took a number of actions to shore up its finances and improve its profitability, including raising \u8364\'20\'AC13 billion in fresh equity, selling a multibillion portfolio of bad loans and cutting costs.\par \par \uc2 Despite the handful of projected laggards, the IMF report said that overall, the largest global banking institutions have become "more resilient since the crisis with stronger capital and liquidity." Collectively, the largest banks have higher capital ratios, more liquidity and fewer assets than at the beginning of the decade.\par \par \uc2 The report cited progress at U.S. banks in particular that raised capital and unloaded noncore businesses. The other seven U.S. banks that are considered systemically important\u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 State Street Corp\uc2 ., \uc2 Wells Fargo & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co\uc2 ., \uc2 Goldman Sachs Group Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , \uc2 Bank of New York Mellon\uc2  and \uc2 Bank of America Corp\uc2 .\u8212\'20\'14were expected to be comfortably profitable through 2019. By 2019, just 29% of assets in the systemically important financial institutions are expected to be in laggard banks, down from 39% over the 2012-16 period and 51% from 2008 to 2011.\par \par \uc2 Yet "problems in even a single" one of such institutions "could generate systemic stress," the IMF said.\par \par \uc2 While the IMF isn't a bank regulator, its report represents an effort from the institution to apply pressure to national regulators and the financial institutions themselves to continue taking steps to ensure the safety of the global financial system.\par \par \uc2 The IMF said regulators should press their financial institutions to resolve nonperforming loans, drop unprofitable lines of business and develop plans to unwind the bank in case of failure.\par \par \uc2 For many market observers, the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, in which \uc2 Bear Stearns\uc2 , \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2  and \uc2 American International Group\uc2  nearly brought down the global financial system, looms large.\par \par \uc2 The report said Japanese banks were particularly struggling to earn high returns due to low interest rates. Mizuho and Mitsubishi, for example, reported lower net profit in the year ended March 2017.\par \par \uc2 Problem banks have either been slow to deal with bad loans from the financial crisis or, as in the case of some European investment banks, had undefined and unprofitable business models, the report said.\par \par \uc2 "Without a more concerted effort to reduce nonperforming assets and improve business models, financial stability concerns could be reignited in the euro area," the IMF said.\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14Jenny Strasburg, Margot Patrick, Giovanni Legorano and Kosaku Narioka contributed to this article\par \par \uc2 China Orders Smoother Markets for Communist Party Congress\par \par \uc2 By Shen Hong\par \par \uc2 SHANGHAI\u8212\'20\'14China's stock market has been edging higher ahead of a major meeting starting next week that will determine the Communist Party's leadership for the next five years.\par \par \uc2 The market's calm, though, has mostly been stage-managed by Beijing.\par \par \uc2 Chinese market regulators have taken steps to ensure stocks remain stable ahead of the congress, which starts Oct. 18, and which is expected to see Xi Jinping confirmed as China's leader for another five years, including measures designed to stop big investors from excessive share selling. Large state-backed investment funds have, meanwhile, been intervening to limit market swings in recent days, several traders say.\par \par \uc2 Beijing's calming efforts appear to have worked so far. The Shanghai Composite Index, China's main equities benchmark, has gained 0.7% since the start of September, just before regulators commenced their campaign to ensure what many local media are predicting will be a "victorious" 19th Communist Party congress. On Wednesday the market closed up 0.2% following listless trading.\par \par \uc2 The relatively small movement in stocks recently continues an unusually calm year in China's equity markets. In line with other major international markets, volatility in Chinese stocks has dropped to multiyear lows. The Shanghai market has moved up or down by more than 1% on only 10 trading days this year.\par \par \uc2 China's central bank\uc2  has been guiding the yuan, China's currency, to mostly stronger levels this year. Large state-owned lenders have been stepping into the market in recent days to ensure the yuan doesn't fall too far against the dollar during daily trading in onshore markets, traders say.\par \par \uc2 The authorities' determination to maintain market stability, or wei wen in Chinese, has been conspicuous in the country's $8.6 trillion stock market, the world's second largest.\par \par \uc2 Last month China's securities regulator summoned the heads of several large brokerages for meetings to instruct them to help ensure market stability ahead of the coming party congress, according to two people familiar with the situation.\par \par \uc2 At a subsequent meeting on Sept. 25, the head of the \uc2 China Securities Regulatory Commission\uc2 , Liu Shiyu, called on fellow senior officials at the regulator and major stock exchanges to keep the markets calm pre-congress, urging them to understand the importance of doing so "from the height of political consciousness."\par \par \uc2 The regulator has also used informal instructions known as window guidance to achieve its stability goal, including warning some major fund managers against selling more shares than they buy on a daily basis, according to senior executives at two asset-management firms.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Shanghai Stock Exchange\uc2  has ordered the country's largest brokerages to closely monitor unusual fund movements in their clients' accounts, said an executive at a Shanghai-based brokerage. "We need to send in a report to the exchange at the end of every trading day to say that everything is OK," he said.\par \par \uc2 So strong is the sense of vigilance that the Shanghai exchange has also asked brokerages in the city to have their offices at least partially staffed during weekends or public holidays, according to the brokerage executive.\par \par \uc2 "I was on duty for the midautumn festival on Oct. 4 when everyone else was eating moon cakes at home," the executive said, referring to a recent national holiday. "The idea is that if any unhappy retail investor protests in front of your building, you have to deal with it immediately," he added.\par \par \uc2 The head of the dealing room at one of China's biggest money-market brokers said the company has even postponed all trading-system upgrades until the party congress is over. "The aim is to prevent any potential risk, no matter how small it may seem," he said.\par \par \uc2 Aside from regulatory guidance, state-backed investment funds such as China Securities Finance Corp. and \uc2 Central Huijin Investment Ltd\uc2 . have been acting to prevent the stock market both from slumping or overheating. These funds, nicknamed the "national team" locally, have performed a similar role in Chinese markets ever since a spectacular Chinese market crash in the last half of 2015.\par \par \uc2 After the Shanghai index opened up 1.6% on Monday following a weeklong holiday, the national team dumped large financial stocks to take some heat out of the market, said a person familiar with the matter, helping to erasing half the market's initial gain by the time trading ended.\par \par \uc2 "Wei wen is Chairman Liu's top priority right now and he doesn't like excessive rallies. That's why the national team was sent in," said the person, referring to Liu Shiyu, China's top securities regulator.\par \par \uc2 While Beijing's actions have succeeded in terms of keeping markets calm so far, "such a paternalistic approach is not a good thing for the market in the long run," said Amy Lin, senior analyst at Capital Securities.\par \par \uc2 "It will make Chinese retail investors even more dependent on the government in the future. Whenever the market falls, they will blame you," Ms. Lin said.

Aspects such as agreement on a common European deposit insurance program and a fund to provide emergency coverage for the resolution of banks are still to be agreed. In a document published Wednesday, the Commission suggested the common deposit insurance scheme could be introduced in a more gradual fashion.\par \par \uc2 It said that moving to a coinsurance phase, where money transferred from European to national coffers wouldn't be repaid, "would be conditional on progress achieved in reducing the level of [nonperforming loans] and other legacy assets assessed through an Asset Quality Review."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dombrovskis told reporters in Brussels that the "ultimate goal of the proposal is to reach a fully-fledged European deposit insurance scheme."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Commission\uc2  proposed a banking union in 2012 as an effort to break the link between struggling states and banks. Two of the three components of the union are in place, namely a common supervisor and a common resolution framework. The third element, the common deposit insurance program, remains highly contentious.\par \par \uc2 Europe's largest economy, Germany, is very wary of bailing out weaker southern European banks. Though outgoing German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u228\'00\'E4uble is considered a hard-liner, his successor, who could come from the business-friendly Free Democratic Party, might be even stricter, potentially making agreement on deposit insurance more difficult.\par \par \uc2 The Commission said that given current economic tailwinds on the continent, now was the right time to push for ambitious changes. "The moment to take bold but realistic actions is now, mending the roof while the sun is still shining and while the European economy is experiencing a sustained recovery," it said in an accompanying document. "All Member States stand to lose if the current momentum is not used."\par \par \uc2 The Commission's proposal received qualified praise from lawmakers. "The Commission communication provides new, useful perspectives and provides the necessary momentum to move forward," said Esther de Lange, a Dutch member of the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  from the European People's Party.\par \par \uc2 Still, she said, her bloc was worried "that the communication will not sufficiently tackle the issue of moral hazard as it proposes to immediately use the European fund during a crisis, whereas we believe we should use national deposit guarantee schemes first."\par \par \uc2 Others took a more critical stance. "We deeply deplore the Commission's intent to drop the project of setting up a real European deposit insurance scheme as suggested in its communication adopted today," said Pervenche Ber\u232\'00\'E8s of the Socialists and Democrats group. "This represents a serious blow to completing the Banking Union."\par \par \uc2 WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup\par \par \uc2 Moody's Downgrades More Than $30B in Puerto Rico Debt\par \par \uc2 Moody's Investors Service downgraded more than $30 billion in Puerto Rico debt late Wednesday citing "protracted economic and revenue disruptions," caused by Hurricane Maria.

The market seems to have already reached the same conclusion: Benchmark general obligation bonds traded at about 35 cents on the dollar Wednesday, compared to 59 cents on the dollar in the weeks before the hurricane.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Kroger Co\uc2 . said it may sell its convenience stores and cut other costs, as the nation's largest traditional grocer battles \uc2 Amazon.com Inc\uc2 . and other new competitors.\par \par \uc2 The nearly 800 convenience stores, most which sell gas, will likely fetch \uc2 Kroger\uc2  a higher return than profits delivered to the company currently, executives told investors at an annual meeting Wednesday at the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It just looks like the economics make sense to do it," said Chief Executive \uc2 Rodney McMullen\uc2  in an interview. "It's obviously a decision you don't do lightly. The C-stores have been in the business for a long time."\par \par \uc2 Mr. McMullen said the move toward a sale was part of a routine analysis of the company's sprawling assets conducted several months ago and not in response to \uc2 Amazon\uc2 's announcement it would buy \uc2 Whole Foods Market\uc2  in June. But the e-commerce giant's most concerted play into the grocery segment has upended the food retail industry.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McMullen said he didn't know if the company had bidders yet or how long it would take to decide whether to sell.\par \par \uc2 The grocer has hired \uc2 Goldman Sachs & Co\uc2 . to review options for the stores operated in 18 states under 68 franchise operations, including \uc2 Turkey Hill Minit Markets\uc2 , Loaf 'N Jug, KwikShop, Tom Thumb and QuickStop.\par \par \uc2 The total group of \uc2 Kroger\uc2  convenience stores could be worth $1.5 to $2 billion based on current valuations, according to the \uc2 National Association of Convenience Stores\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The stores' 11,000 employees were notified of the possible sale, \uc2 Kroger\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 The grocer's stock rose more than 6% before tapering off to around $21 a share, the biggest single-day bump in months but not enough to erase big declines this year. \uc2 Kroger\uc2 's stock has shed {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kroger-shares-slide-as-grocer-is-battered-by-price-fight-1497531764"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 more than a third of its value}}}\uc2  this year as investors worried about the company's plans for fending off competition from \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and others. Shares in many food-sellers have tumbled since \uc2 Amazon{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-for-13-7-billion-1497618446"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 said it was buying}}}\uc2 Whole Foods\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Selling the convenience stores could deprive \uc2 Kroger\uc2  of one means for reaching its goal to capture more of the roughly $1.5 trillion spent in the U.S. each year on food and consumables. The stores generated $4 billion in revenue last year and have delivered more than five years of identical store sales growth.\par \par \uc2 Convenience stores and other nontraditional retail outlets are one place consumers are buying more food instead of traditional grocery stores and, thanks in part to fuel sales and lower operating costs, convenience stores tend to have higher profit margins than traditional grocery stores.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Kroger\uc2  and other food retailers are cutting costs swiftly and abandoning plans to build new stores to invest instead on e-commerce offerings and other technologies. The company said Wednesday that it would roll out a system that allows customers to ring up their own groceries through a wireless hand-held scanner to 400 stores by next year, up from 20 today.\par \par \uc2 "We need to move faster on digital," Mr. McMullen said.\par \par \uc2 Executives also said that, under a program dubbed "Restock \uc2 Kroger\uc2 ," they will seek to sell more advertising, generate new income from a data-\b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  division, rethink how to restock shelves and continue to cut prices on some items to avoid losing customers. They said the effort will generate $400 million in profit by 2020, and that broader cost-cutting is expected to free up more than $4 billion in cash over the next three years.\par \par \uc2 Kroger\uc2  executives also acknowledged that they didn't cut costs enough or guard against competitors while business was good. Discounters and other kinds of food sellers have drawn new shoppers in the past two years, including German discount chains \uc2 Aldi\uc2  and \uc2 Lidl\uc2 , Mr. McMullen said.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Lidl\uc2  is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lidl-stores-gain-little-traction-so-far-in-u-s-1507460402"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 slowly gaining customers }}}\uc2 since opening a first group of stores in June, Mr. McMullen said he assumes the chain will succeed.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Lidl\uc2  is a great retailer," he said. "We've been studying their stores for at least 10 years."\par \par \uc2 Wall Street analysts viewed \uc2 Kroger\uc2 's cost-cutting and shelf stocking changes positively, but were cautious able whether the effort would really reap the savings the grocer projected.\par \par \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 . executives on Tuesday said they would open the fewest number of U.S. stores in decades in their 2019 fiscal year and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-touts-e-commerce-focus-as-it-reveals-new-financial-targets-1507639810"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cut more costs to free up cash}}}\uc2  for e-commerce and store improvements. \uc2 Costco Wholesale Corp\uc2 . said earlier this month that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/costco-with-an-eye-on-amazon-expands-home-delivery-service-1507284001"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 it would expand home delivery service}}}\uc2 , a departure for a company that prioritizes in-store promotions.\par \par \uc2 Online food shopping is still small in the U.S., but it is expected to grow. Thirteen percent of people surveyed by the TABS \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  research firm last month reported shopping for food online, up a percentage point from last year. Grocery analysts predict annual double-digit growth in online grocery shopping in coming years, compared with sluggish sales increases in traditional supermarkets.\par \par \uc2 Kroger\uc2  reaffirmed its 2017 guidance on Wednesday despite the impact of storms such as Hurricane Harvey, which closed many of the company's stores in its third-biggest market, Houston. A handful of stores there suffered extensive damage and are being renovated.\par \par \uc2 Kroger\uc2  expects positive same-store sales for the rest of the year after two recent quarters of negative identical-store sales put an end to 13 years of quarterly growth.\par \par \uc2 The company expects earnings per share to be flat or grow slightly for the rest of the year. Net earnings are projected at $1.74 to $1.79 a diluted share, with adjusted net earnings of $2 to $2.05 a share.\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Haddon at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:heather.haddon@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 heather.haddon@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171011edab004jy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The bonds fell further into junk status, lowering \uc2 Moody's\uc2  projections for how much bondholders will eventually recover through the island's court-supervised bankruptcy-like process. \uc2 Moody's\uc2  now expects holders of general obligation bonds and senior sales tax bonds, considered among the island's best protected debt, to receive a minimum of 35 cents on the dollar, down from 65 cents. The market seems to have already reached the same conclusion: Benchmark general obligation bonds traded at about 35 cents on the dollar Wednesday, compared to 59 cents on the dollar in the weeks before the hurricane.

Saffron Anti-Money Laundering Advisor is the first product of the chip giant's 2015 purchase of Saffron Technology. \uc2 Bank of New Zealand\uc2  is an early customer. The software, which uses an \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial-intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  technique called associative memory, addresses an epidemic of money laundering estimated to affect as much as 5% of global GDP and identity theft resulting in losses estimated at $16 billion, Intel said. It lets users enter a query and drill down into a graphical representation of relationships it discovers. Saffron AML Advisor, which is sold as an annual license, pits Intel against \uc2 IBM\uc2  and a variety of other vendors of AML tools. (ted.greenwald@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Equifax Gives More Detail on Breached U.K. Consumer Data\par \par \uc2 Equifax announces additional details about the scope of U.K. consumers who were impacted by its data breach. The company says it will be reaching out to four groups of consumers in the U.K. whose information was accessed. That includes 12,086 consumers who had an email address for their Equifax.co.uk account in 2014 and 14,961 consumers who had username, password, secret questions, answers and other information set up with their Equifax.co.uk membership account in 2014. The other groups involve 29,188 consumers who provided driving license numbers to the company and another group of 637,430 consumers. In total, there were 15.2 million U.K. consumer records dated between 2011 and 2016 that were involved in the hack, as previously disclosed by Equifax. Some 14.5 million of those potentially may only include names and dates of birth of certain U.K. consumers.

So far this year, 866 CEOs have announced exits, down 8.3% from the 944 CEOs that left their posts during the first three quarters last year, Challenger says. Exits during the 3Q, typically the most active time of year, declined 6.6%. Firms experiencing the most CEO turnovers to date include hospitals, service industry businesses, government agencies and non-profit organizations. Challenger tracks exits at both publicly traded and private firms using SEC filings, news reports and corporate announcements.

"We'd guess well below $5B." Besides burned buildings, insurers may see claims for "heat-damaged personal and commercial vehicles, inland marine, and probably some crop claims reflecting damaged vineyards and wineries." Biggest California home and commercial multi-peril insurers: Farmers, State Farm, Liberty Mutual, Allstate, Travelers. \uc2 Munich Reinsurance America\uc2  notes an uptick in the frequency of US wildfires over the past decade that have caused "significant insured property losses," which it says "is mostly a function of new development in areas that are highly vulnerable to wildfires." (leslie.scism@wsj.com)\par \par \uc2 Provident Financial Has Tough Task Reviving Home Credit\par \par \uc2 Barclays\uc2  has downgraded troubled \uc2 Provident Financial PLC\uc2  to under-weight from equal-weight, saying it isn't confident the company can revive its core U.K. doorstep lending business. The investment bank notes that Provident's shares have recovered after slumping when it warned on profit in August due to problems in its core home-credit business. It also said the U.K.'s \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  was investigating a repayment option plan offered by its \uc2 Vanquis Bank\uc2  unit. Provident is due to update the market on Friday. "We're cautious on the shares given our lack of confidence for a turnaround of the home-credit business and the unquantifiable size of potential FCA redress," says \uc2 Barclays\uc2 . Shares fall nearly 5% to 796 pence.

Yet computer algorithms rather than humans are increasingly setting the prices of wheat, gold and fuel.\par \par \uc2 Automated trading systems account for large volumes of transactions in commodity futures markets. In grains and oilseeds they account for 49 per cent, precious metals 54 per cent and crude oil 63 per cent, according to the \uc2 US Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Such systems range from sophisticated black-box algorithms to simple programs that execute an order when prices reach a set level. At \uc2 CME Group\uc2 , the world's biggest futures exchange operator, orders have to be tagged as automated or manual to ease identification.\par \par \uc2 Automation has fuelled a rise in volumes and fee revenue for commodity futures exchanges. But it has also sparked a debate over whether the mechanics of determining prices has changed for the better. Specifically, there are concerns that "fundamental" information such as weather or crop conditions is less useful in guiding short-term prices.\par \par \uc2 "The whole notion of fundamentals on any given day, for weeks at a time, months at a time, has completely gone out the window these days," says Doug Duquette, an executive at Chicago-based Vertex \b \highlight22\uc2 Analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , whose software analyses automated market orders.\par \par \uc2 "You get momentum of algos playing upon algos upon algos, and it will just drive markets to extremes that don't seem to correlate or line up with fundamentals on any given day or time period," he says.\par \par \uc2 John Saucer is vice-president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston, which helps oil and gas producers hedge their sales. He says that "trending" energy markets, in which prices lock into long paths, are a thing of the past. Volatility is instead measured in short bursts.\par \par \uc2 "It makes it more difficult to be a purely fundamental trader. In the past you had to take into account fundamental considerations, technical considerations and seasonal considerations - I do think you have to take into account transactional considerations and algos," he says.\par \par \uc2 In early 2016, a trade group for US cattle ranchers confronted \uc2 CME Group\uc2  with concerns that fast computer traders were causing costly price gyrations in the cattle market.\par \par \uc2 "We're now in an electronic marketplace. The speed of computer advancement and technological advancement has absolutely exceeded our ability to adjust," says Sarah Calhoun, government affairs manager of the \uc2 National Cattlemen's Beef Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The exchange group has since made amendments to its cattle futures contracts and changed how it regulates order messages, by limiting the number of messages a trader could enter per transaction.\par \par \uc2 Some beef producers use automated systems to manage their risks, Ms Calhoun acknowledges, but she says markets have become more volatile as automated trading grows. "We don't demonise and we are not as apprehensive about automated traders as we used to be. But we are not saying that algorithms as a whole are not an issue."\par \par \uc2 By adding to volumes, automated systems should make markets more liquid. Traders, though, say these volumes are concentrated in contracts with imminent delivery dates, such as natural gas for December 2017 rather than December 2020. "Long-dated" futures remain illiquid, traders say.\par \par \uc2 Some also complain that algorithms withdraw standing offers to buy or sell when another trader tries to transact with them, creating a mirage of market depth. "They've become a bit of a nuisance," says Ernest Scalamandre of AC Investment Management. "They add volume but they don't add liquidity."\par \par \uc2 Misgivings aside, there is no nostalgia for the days when trading consisted of people shouting and waving hands on old exchange floors. There, information about the identity and size of orders was apparent to the privileged few who held exchange seats, often at the expense of others calling in orders by telephone.\par \par \uc2 "Electronic trading, from the point of view of a fund manager like me, is a hell of a lot better than pit trading because [automated trading systems] don't screw you," says John Bondurant, a fund manager in Memphis. "It used to be if I wanted to do 200 or 300 lots [contracts] of cotton it would take me all day. Now I can do it sometimes in 30 seconds. The liquidity is much deeper."\par \par \uc2 FIA, the futures industry trade group, says automated trading has many benefits. Greg Wood, FIA senior vice-president of global industry operations, says: "It's important to note that automation isn't driving prices - fundamentals are still doing so, and automation makes price discovery more efficient."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171010edaa0002g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

The farming industry faces new pressure to reinvent itself as the consumer appetite for organic food and produce grown without genetic modifications surges.\par \par \uc2 Pontifax AgTech's co-investors and investors add to the network of farming businesses, agricultural conglomerates and technical experts with which the firm has ties. The Santa Monica, Calif., firm has invested alongside agribusiness venture arms such as Syngenta Ventures and Monsanto Growth Ventures. It has partnered with the Wonderful Co. and other growers to validate technologies developed by its portfolio companies.\par \par \uc2 Pontifax AgTech also has invested alongside TPG in backing Anuvia Plant Nutrients, a business that uses organic materials to make fertilizers.\par \par \uc2 The flurry of recent investments in agricultural technology highlights how both food giants and private-equity firms are looking closely at ways to make farming more high-tech.\par \par \uc2 "There's is a greater recognition from traditional tech investors that agriculture is a sector that is inefficient and a ripe space for investments in data IT and enterprise software," said Ben Belldegrun, a managing partner at the firm.\par \par \uc2 Pontifax AgTech was launched in 2014 by Mr. Belldegrun, previously a managing partner at Lodestone Natural Resources hedge fund and portfolio manager at hedge-fund manager Brevan Howard; and Phil Erlanger, formerly a personal investor in agricultural technology and a senior banker at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\par \par \uc2 The firm, which focuses on investing $10 million to $15 million per company, has backed four businesses out of a warehouse vehicle funded by anchor investors, and then rolled the portfolio in 2016 into what became its first institutional fund.\par \par \uc2 One of its portfolio holdings, \uc2 Blue River Technology\uc2 , which makes "see-and-spray" robots to calibrate the precise amount of herbicides needed in fields, was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deere-to-acquire-blue-river-technology-for-305-million-1504782683"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sold last month to Deere & Co}}}\uc2 . The technology, which uses \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2 , fits within a theme Pontifax is angling to play in: using machines to reduce farming businesses' reliance on menial labor.\par \par \uc2 "Labor continually is a big bottleneck and a difficult thing to come by in the U.S.," Mr. Belldegrun said.

Mapbox said on Tuesday it would expand its efforts into autonomous cars and augmented and virtual reality and will accelerate international expansion, including in China.\par \par \uc2 Mapbox says it provides mapping technology to more than 900,000 developers, whose apps in turn provide the aggregate data that power the company's maps in real-time. The company collects data on more than 200 million miles of roads and terrain each day, while keeping app users anonymous.\par \par \uc2 "Every time people touch us and use us, the map gets smarter," Mapbox Chief Executive \uc2 Eric Gundersen\uc2  said. "We have more connected sensors on the road today, using Mapbox, than the entire auto industry will have by the end of 2020."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gundersen founded Mapbox in 2010 after trying to create layered maps for nonprofits and government agencies to help track malaria outbreaks in Zambia and to support elections in Pakistan. There has since been an explosion of interest in digital maps, especially among companies trying to develop self-driving vehicles that rely on high-quality maps to navigate the world.\par \par \uc2 Mapbox is pitching itself as an alternative to \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2 , whose mapping data powers a number of companies' apps. Alphabet's self-driving car unit, \uc2 Waymo\uc2 , emerged out of \uc2 Google\uc2 's efforts to create detailed maps of the world, giving it a head start in autonomous-vehicle development.\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2 's push into the automotive world left some auto makers concerned about relying on a competitor for data.

The firm said it plans to devote 15% of its new early-stage fund, a $450 million partnership closed in April, to life scients. That's up from around 2% with its last early-stage fund, closed in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Technologies like \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data emerging from genomics research, sensors and electronic-medical records create new opportunities to improve health care, according to Mr. Yap, who most recently was an entrepreneur-in-residence with Illumina Ventures. He also previously was chief executive and co-founder of digital-health startup PyrAmes, and he co-founded and led protein-analysis company Biodesy Inc.\par \par \uc2 Menlo made initial medical investments in the 1980s and incubated biotechnology company \uc2 Gilead Sciences Inc\uc2 ., which went public in 1992. Frustrated with the regulatory hurdles and long holding periods seen with drug and medical-device companies, the Menlo Park, Calif., firm stopped making new health-care deals in the mid-1990s.\par \par \uc2 But the technology-enabled health startups it backs now bear little resemblance to the medical companies it funded in the 1980s, Partner \uc2 Mark Siegel\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Portfolio company Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., for example, applies {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/recursion-pharma-gets-second-round-this-year-1507030200"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \\b artificial intelligence\\b0 }}}\uc2 to drug discovery and can license compounds out to companies willing to shoulder the high costs of testing drugs in clinical trials.\par \par \uc2 "The need for large organizations to bring innovation from the outside is greater than ever before," Mr. Yap said. "The well-designed therapeutic platform that can efficiently fill that innovation gap will be extremely valuable."\par \par \uc2 Other technology firms eyeing similar types of investments include \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , which recently hired Jorge Conde as a general partner to deploy its bio fund along with General Partner \uc2 Vijay Pande\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Menlo, which is about to begin investing its newest venture fund, backed Recursion through its 2015 early-stage vehicle. Other existing life-sciences holdings include Cofactor Genomics Inc., which applies RNA-analysis capabilities to disease diagnostics, and Clear Labs Inc., a food-safety technology company.\par \par \uc2 Write to Brian Gormley at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:brian.gormley@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 brian.gormley@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROVC20171010edaa001b9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

But it also means that consumers might be less vigilant in protecting their private information at a time when they are at an increased risk of identity theft.\par \par \uc2 "Breach fatigue is real," said Marcus Christian, a partner at \uc2 Mayer Brown LLP\uc2 , referring to a phenomenon in which people stop paying attention to cyberattacks following a particularly large data breach or a string of publicized breaches. "It would definitely be bad if people became less responsive to incidents like this in the future."\par \par \uc2 Cybersecurity experts said that the best way for businesses and consumers to fight breach fatigue is to treat incidents as serious, separate threats. For example, data breach victims should take basic steps such as locking their credit and changing their passwords after being notified that their information has been compromised.\par \par \uc2 A study released Tuesday by the identity management firm CyberScout LLC and the \uc2 Identity Theft Resource Center\uc2 , a non-profit advocacy group for identity theft victims, suggested that breach fatigue is already a concern, and that victims don't take steps to protect themselves despite knowing the risks associated with a breach.\par \par \uc2 The survey of 317 data breach victims found that about 50% of respondents were confused about what to do after receiving a breach notification, and less than half of them took recommended steps to protect themselves after their personal information was stolen.\par \par \uc2 These steps include basic tasks such as informing banks of the breach, closing affected accounts, changing passwords, requesting a credit report, and signing up for credit and identity monitoring services. More than 80% of respondents said they understood they were at a higher risk for identity theft and were concerned it could lead to financial harm.\par \par \uc2 "These survey results reiterate something we already had a feeling was happening, which is that many people don't know what to do in the event that their personal data is stolen," said \uc2 Eva Velasquez\uc2 , chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center, in a statement. "As we are seeing with the Equifax breach, no one is immune to data breaches or the threat of identity theft, and there clearly needs to be better public education about how consumers can resolve ID theft and protect themselves."\par \par \uc2 Cybersecurity experts say that it's not just consumers who succumb to breach fatigue--companies themselves may take data breaches less seriously as they become normalized.\par \par \uc2 "There used to be a serious worry about the effect of a data breach on a brand\u8230\'20\'26 It's now just a cost of doing business," said John Iannarelli, a retired special agent with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  who specialized in cybercrime.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Iannarelli said companies such as Sonic, which experienced a data breach that may have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-sonic-drive-in-may-have-impacted-millions-of-credit-debit-cards/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 affected millions}}}\uc2  of credit card holders, and Whole Foods, which experienced a breach that affected {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/whole-foods-reports-customer-credit-card-breach-at-58-locations/2017/10/04/594a056e-a884-11e7-94ce-4f901ed36a82_story.html?utm_term=.8d5bdf7c057e"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 56 locations}}}\uc2  around the country, may evade reputational damage because their disclosures were overshadowed by larger incidents.\par \par \uc2 The Equifax breach, for example, potentially compromised the personal information of 145.5 million U.S. consumers, and has dominated headlines with a series of investigations and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-rip-credit-reporting-model-in-wake-of-equifax-breach-1507136171"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 congressional hearings}}}\uc2 . On Tuesday, \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  said a breach in 2013 was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-triples-estimate-of-breached-accounts-to-3-billion-1507062804"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 significantly larger}}}\uc2  than it originally disclosed, affecting all 3 billion user accounts.\par \par \uc2 "We get desensitized to breaches the more we hear about these huge numbers," said Kenneth Sanford, U.S. lead \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  architect at Dataiku Inc., a data science software company. "From a psychological perspective that's nice--we worry less. But we need to become more mature and aware."\par \par \uc2 (Adam Janofsky writes about cybersecurity for WSJ Pro, with a speciality in small business.

In some cases, they will also have to justify this cost to investors.\par \par \uc2 "Mifid II is hurtling towards the industry and most institutions are unprepared," says Ms Margetts, who left her analyst role at Investec Asset Management to set up Alpha Exchange.\par \par \uc2 Ahead of the new rules, more than a dozen online research marketplaces, including Alpha Exchange, RSRCHXchange and Electronic Research Interchange, have sprung up. These gather research for users to buy, with some saying they will take a commission.\par \par \uc2 Typically started by former bankers and fund managers, they have zippy user interfaces and the promise of \uc2 Netflix\uc2 -style personalised suggestions.\par \par \uc2 But these newcomers are aware they face a mighty challenge - in the shape of \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and research aggregators such as Bloomberg and \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2 , which provide dedicated terminals for asset managers and banks around the world and have decades-long relationships and deep pockets.\par \par \uc2 "The aggregators are trying to capture share of the research distribution market at a time when disruption is happening," says Gerard Walsh, head of business development at Northern Trust Capital Markets. "But they will need to be timely and nimble, and not all will necessarily thrive."\par \par \uc2 Of the 40,000 pieces of research by the 15 biggest banks that flood fund managers' inboxes every week, only 5 per cent are opened, according to estimates by consultancy Quinlan & Associates, and less than 1 per cent are read.\par \par \uc2 The new sites allow users to buy online but they can also track clicks and scroll depth to provide an audit trail of consumption that asset managers can use to justify their research charges.\par \par \uc2 Many offer data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  to find relevant research and make recommendations - and some rate and reward researchers. Pricing models range from subscriptions to pay-per-view and auctions.\par \par \uc2 In the past 10 months, Alpha says it has signed up more than 150 research providers, from large-tier banks to independents - as well as mid-size and larger asset managers.\par \par \uc2 But some research providers warn that the new services ignore the importance of existing relationships.\par \par \uc2 "It's not a transaction, like buying a book on \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2 ; rather, it's a relationship," says Paul Domjan, head of the research, \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  and data division at Exotix, a boutique investment bank in London.\par \par \uc2 Here incumbents such as Bloomberg, \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2 , Factset, S&P and Capital IQ plan to use their longstanding experience in aggregating research to continue distributing to their hundreds of asset manager customers.\par \par \uc2 Bloomberg has introduced new functionality allowing asset managers to track interactions - such as face-to-face meetings - with analysts. This year, \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2  will enable fund managers to rank analysts' work for the first time on its Eikon terminal. It is also working on an initiative to allow managers to buy "research collections" - for example a sector package.\par \par \uc2 "We will see a number of innovations and business models in the year ahead," says Mahesh Narayan, head of research and portfolio management at \uc2 Thomson Reuters\uc2 . "We are observing them, working out who we need to partner with and doing some innovation on our side."\par \par \uc2 But the cost of using one of the \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  companies can be a sore point among asset managers.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Davies\uc2 , who in 2014 quit as a portfolio manager at London hedge fund CQS, to start RSRCHXchange, said he could compete with the cost of Bloomberg's $22,000-a-year terminal.\par \par \uc2 "For smaller fund managers on tight budgets we can provide access to research on a piecemeal basis - for example, you may not want Italian banks research all year but you may really want it when there is a banking crisis," he says. "For larger ones we can provide a way to access smaller, more niche research providers."\par \par \uc2 RSRCHXchange has signed up more than 220 research providers, he says.\par \par \uc2 Some believe Mifid II will revolutionise how research is provided and consumed but others warn the time to make an impact is limited.\par \par \uc2 "If you're collecting research from third parties and providing them to Mifid investment firms with a filter and can charge on a granular basis, that sounds to me like a win-win for everybody," says \uc2 Neil Robson\uc2 , a lawyer at \uc2 Katten Muchin Rosenman\uc2  in London.\par \par \uc2 The newcomers "need to land with a big splash", he adds, "or they will just fall flat".\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171006eda60001w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

If that could swallow the knowledge the advisers have and then the soft skills the advisers have, that might help you get to that real robo-advice. But that\u8217\'20\'19s a long way off.\par \par \uc2 Wealthify, which was launched in Cardiff in 2016, offers investors access to one of five low-cost investment plans through Isas and general investment accounts for just \u163\'00\'A31.\par \par \uc2 Aviva said it will also support the robo-adviser\u8217\'20\'19s business development and growth plans.\par \par \uc2 Blair Turnbull, managing director at Aviva UK Digital, said:\par \par \uc2 This is another important step in Aviva\u8217\'20\'19s digital strategy. It underlines our commitment to invest in and partner with leading digital businesses, allowing our customers to benefit from new technology and making insurance and investments simpler, easier and more convenient.\par \par \uc2 Richard Theo, co-founder and chief executive of Wealthify, said:\par \par \uc2 The capital investment from Aviva will be used primarily to accelerate our ambitious growth plans as well as develop our technology to enhance the proposition. We will remain focused on simplicity, affordability and transparency, and strive to make investing accessible to everyone.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171005eda50018h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web. \par \par \uc2 Bruce Carnegie-Brown\uc2 , the new chairman of Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s, says that the 300-year-old insurance market needs to do more to modernise itself and that progress so far has been \u8220\'20\'1Clumpy\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Carnegie-Brown joined Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s in June, with the market undergoing a technological overhaul. Insurers and brokers complain that it is an expensive, old-fashioned place to do business. There are fears that, unless it makes itself more efficient, people will buy and sell their insurance elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  in his first interview since taking the post, Mr Carnegie-Brown says that modernisation is a priority. \u8220\'20\'1CThe issue is can we be competitive. Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s has a terrifically strong reputation around its underwriting performance. What lets Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s down is its cost structure.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople arrive\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09with files of documents. Those documents have to be photocopied, and those photocopies have to be scanned and digitised. If it was in digital form right at the beginning we could reduce the costs for the brokers in bringing business to Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s, reduce the costs for the underwriters in capturing the data and improve the quality of \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere isn\u8217\'20\'19t anyone who runs a syndicate here who isn\u8217\'20\'19t aware of the need to create digital solutions to challenges and there isn\u8217\'20\'19t anyone in the millennial generation joining Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s who doesn\u8217\'20\'19t get frustrated with the fact that they have better technology at home than they have at work.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CUntil we convert everything from analogue to digital, we\u8217\'20\'19ve got unnecessary costs.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But despite a big push to digitise the market, Mr Carnegie-Brown says that progress has been patchy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CProgress is lumpy because self-confidence is not as high as it needs to be,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CLloyd\u8217\'20\'19s has tried to modernise before and it hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been terribly successful, so people are sceptical of this but it\u8217\'20\'19s a mindset issue, not a technology issue.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A decade ago an electronic trading platform called Kinnect was shut down after it failed to win widespread support in the market. More recently there were hopes that insurers and brokers would use iPads. Despite those efforts, face-to-face meetings and paper documents still rule.\par \par \uc2 Mr Carnegie-Brown says that a system designed to allow brokers to place business online had taken longer to launch than expected because it had to be adapted for higher volumes of business.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSome of that upgrade has taken a bit longer than we wanted and therefore some of the adoption of the system by brokers is slower than we wanted,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 A newfound enthusiasm for data ownership is also holding the market back.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNobody cared [about data] when it was in analogue form because nobody read it but in digital form suddenly it has huge value and so there are people who try to create obstacles to free movement of that data,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Before joining Lloyd\u8217\'20\'19s Mr Carnegie-Brown was chairman of Moneysupermarket, the price comparison site. He hopes that the sort of data processing now common in high volume consumer insurance can be replicated in the commercial insurance world.\par \par \uc2 He also called on the wider insurance industry to move with the times.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t think the industry is doing enough to innovate,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. While there has been progress in developing new products such as cyber insurance, Mr Carnegie-Brown says that insurers need to do more to adapt their products.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CInsurance has been writing property cover for hundreds of years,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1C If you look at the largest companies by market cap now they are mostly characterised by intangible assets rather than tangible assets and we\u8217\'20\'19ve got to make sure the industry is innovative enough to respond to those opportunities.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Insurers, he argues, need to do more to offer cover for companies\u8217\'20\'19 brands and reputations rather than focusing on covering physical assets.\par \par \uc2 Document FTCOM00020171004eda4000ru\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Private-equity firms raised a record $324 billion in the first half of 2017, according to Dow Jones & Co. research database LP Source. Rising dividends to investors and a growing market for secondhand fund stakes have perpetuated the cycle of money available to the asset class.\par \par \uc2 But excess capital hurts private equity in three ways: high asset prices dent exit multiples; and, unspent cash drags on fund returns by extending hold periods and inflating fees, which offset investor returns.\par \par \uc2 Two traditional measures for private equity's performance\u8212\'20\'14return multiples and funds' internal rates of return\u8212\'20\'14have been falling in line with rising asset prices, slow macroeconomic growth and mounting dry powder.\par \par \uc2 "Lots of dry powder is bad for returns\u8230\'20\'26It compresses returns from a multiple perspective," said Associate Professor Oliver Gottschalg, who teaches at business school \uc2 HEC Paris\uc2  and is head of research at private-equity fund \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  provider Peracs LLC.\par \par \uc2 Average global buyout return multiples based on a rolling three-year average fell to 1.17 times in 2012, down from 1.21 times in 2011, 1.20 times in 2010 and 1.28 times in 2008 and 2009, well below the heady heights of up to 1.5 times in the early 2000s, according to Peracs. These are the latest fund multiples cited in Peracs' 2017 report because of the three-year lag in buyout returns known as the J-curve, which reflects the time it usually takes to generate a profit from selling an asset.\par \par \uc2 Funds' returns on exit have been directly knocked by rising asset prices, which rose to a record 10.9 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in late 2016, according to consultancy \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Superabundant capital has diluted returns across the asset classes, not just private equity," \uc2 Bain & Co\uc2 . said in its Global Private Equity Report 2017. "Everyone is chasing yield, and where investors spot a sliver of extra yield, they pile in and bid down returns."\par \par \uc2 As asset prices rise, private-equity firms must work harder to generate a return. As deal values are now at a record high, they must sell at even higher prices to generate an upside.\par \par \uc2 Cash and Fee Drag\par \par \uc2 Overall fund performance is also suffering from private-equity's excess cash reserves.\par \par \uc2 Global private-equity IRRs dropped to 10.54% to 10.56% for 2014 vintages, from 10.7% in 2013 and 13% in 2012, according to the latest estimates from data provider \uc2 Pitchbook Data Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fund performance benefits when investments are sold quicker, and firms that take longer to spend their money and divest assets can find their returns suffer. This is because fund returns are time-dependent and calculated from the point of investment, serving as an indication of the profit a fund has made through sales over a set duration.\par \par \uc2 "All else being equal, for the same deal a longer holding period will mathematically decrease returns (both fund multiples and IRRs)," Professor Gottschalg said.\par \par \uc2 He explained that "if holding periods get longer, IRR decreased because to reach the same outcome it takes longer so the IRRs get lower."\par \par \uc2 Recent figures show that firms are taking longer to make money from their investments. Pitchbook estimates that median hold periods for private-equity funds rose to 5.75 years in 2014, up from 5.49 years in 2013 and 3.29 years in 2009, and were 4.99 years as of 2017.\par \par \uc2 Funds that take longer to invest also have lower returns due to the effect of fee drag, according to Professor Gottshalg.\par \par \uc2 Investors pay fees on uninvested capital and the more uninvested capital remains in a fund, the longer those fees will be paid, which reduces fund IRRs.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Braunack, an investment fund partner at law firm \uc2 Kirkland & Ellis LLP\uc2 , said more firms are lengthening their investment period or reusing and recycling capital so they can plough profits straight back into new acquisitions as they struggle to spend their growing war chests.\par \par \uc2 The length of time private-equity firms take to invest their money has increased in recent years as firms have found it harder to put money to work amid high prices and competition for assets.\par \par \uc2 It now takes longer to invest a private-equity fund than to invest any other type of private-capital fund, such as vehicles focused on debt, venture capital, growth, real estate or natural resources, according to data provider Preqin's Private Capital Fund Terms Advisor study for 2016.\par \par \uc2 The data provider said the mean investment period for global private-equity buyout funds rose to 5.6 years in 2015, up from 4.9 years in 2014, but settled back to 5.4 years in 2016. It only began compiling these figures in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Slow growth, high prices and slow spending have depressed returns, according to Mr. Braunack.\par \par \uc2 "Gross returns are affected by a slow macroeconomic environment and people paying too much on going in," he said.\par \par \uc2 Chasing Alpha\par \par \uc2 Yet despite the trend of declining returns, Professor Gottschalg said that in relation to the public markets, payback from private-equity investments is increasing. Peracs' Alpha metric measures the asset class's outperformance relative to the public markets and shows an increasing trend since 2000.\par \par \uc2 "There's a downward trend if you look at absolute returns but if you look at alpha the trend is improving," he said.\par \par \uc2 Distributions to investors rose to record highs in 2016 because firms took advantage of high prices to sell and refinance assets and return capital to investors, according to \uc2 Lloyds Banking Group\uc2 's head of financial sponsors Stephen Quinn.\par \par \uc2 He said unspent capital is rising as firms are cautious about spending money in today's frothy market: "A large amount of dry powder is simply about caution. It's caution and discipline."\par \par \uc2 With fundraising and unspent capital showing no sign of abating, the full extent of dry powder's drag on private equity has yet to be seen.\par \par \uc2 "The aggregate dry powder hasn't really worked its way through the system," said Mr. Braunack.\par \par \uc2 But what is clear is that returns are expected to decline further as vast swathes of capital chase fewer deals, perpetuating the cycle of higher asset prices.\par \par \uc2 "We do expect absolute returns to private equity will continue to decrease in the long term," said Pitchbook analyst Dylan Cox. "We see no decrease in acquisition multiples in sight. Dry powder continues to be at all-time highs. That, combined with competition from strategic acquirers, means prices continue to move higher. Higher acquisition prices generate lower returns."\par \par \uc2 Write to Jessica Davies at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:jessica.davies@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 jessica.davies@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROPE20171004eda4000dx\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 150,000 additional jobs.\par \par \uc2 The August gain in payrolls was revised down to 228,000 from 235,000. The ADP report is based on private-payroll data in addition to government data.\par \par \uc2 "In September, small businesses experienced a dip in hiring," said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-leader of the ADP Research Institute. "This is in part due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma which significantly impacted smaller retailers. In addition, the continued slow down we have seen in small business hiring could be due to a lack of competitive compensation to attract skilled talent."\par \par \uc2 The ADP report comes ahead of the monthly jobs report from the \uc2 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2  on Friday. The BLS report is expected to show slower gains in employment. Economists expect nonfarm jobs to rise by 80,000 for September, compared with a gain of 156,000 the prior month.\par \par \uc2 Write to Bowdeya Tweh at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Bowdeya.Tweh@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bowdeya.Tweh@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCB20171004eda4000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

The Optimisation unit accounts for just under half of group profits.\par \par \uc2 Nex\uc2  said that first-half operating margins at the unit would fall to 20 per cent. This compares with 29 per cent in its full-year results and 36 per cent for the year to March 2016. \uc2 Nex\uc2  said margins would "normalise" in the second half.\par \par \uc2 Elliott Broadbent, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said he expected a cost-savings programme would boost earnings but "we do not expect that they will make up the shortfall. This is a profit warning, plain and simple."\par \par \uc2 Nex\uc2  is counting on a root-and-branch reorganisation of Optimisation to boost profitability. To aid growth it bought two small data and \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  companies.\par \par \uc2 It also started a project to put more customer data - which belong to banks, hedge funds and asset managers - on to a blockchain database, with the aim of cutting costs. This project reduced margins by four percentage points in the first half, Nex said.\par \par \uc2 "These investments will enhance the potential for Nex Optimisation," said Mr Spencer. He committed to a long-term operating profit target for the unit of at least 40 per cent by 2020.\par \par \uc2 Group revenue for the six months to September 30 increased by more than 7 per cent on a constant currency basis. The shares fell 5.6 per cent to close at 625p.\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171003eda30000n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Drugs aren't always designed for the purpose they end up being used for. \uc2 Pfizer\uc2 's Viagra, for example, was originally developed for cardiovascular conditions but gained popularity for an altogether different use.\par \par \uc2 Pharmaceutical companies can gain these insights much earlier if they have access to a blend of robotic microscopes and image-processing software that can spot potential new drug targets in the lab.\par \par \uc2 That promise has attracted investors to Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing a \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  platform that may be able to do just that. It is testing hundreds of drug compounds, looking for new targets that could expand their use and profitability.\par \par \uc2 Data Collective led an oversubscribed $60 million Series B round in the Salt Lake City-based startup, which only eight months ago closed its Series A round. Its funding to date now totals $80 million.\par \par \uc2 To test a drug's untapped potential, Recursion has set up a fleet of automated microscopes and \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  software to rapidly assess thousands of biological characteristics of different cells including size, shape and the position of its inner workings.\par \par \uc2 Over the past four years, the company has amassed more than 2 million images to train neural networks to identify which existing drug combinations could be used to target cells in new ways. From there, Recursion run tens of thousands of automated experiments weekly to test those hypotheses.\par \par \uc2 So far, the company has generated more than 30 discovery programs on more than two dozen diseases and expects to begin clinical trials next year. It has partnerships with four pharmaceutical companies including \uc2 Sanofi\uc2 -\uc2 Genzyme\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "They have this massive data set and tool that we have only watched get better and better since we've known them," said Data Collective Co-Managing Partner Zachary Bogue, who will join the board.\par \par \uc2 Recursion is also looking to develop drugs on its own.\par \par \uc2 "As we do these experiments and identify potential new treatments, we are also generating data that can be mined for other uses," said Recursion Chief Executive and co-founder Christopher Gibson.\par \par \uc2 Investors are paying attention to other software startups using \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to accelerate drug discovery. \uc2 Khosla Ventures\uc2  just backed Toronto-based Deep Genomics Inc.'s quest to develop new drugs for genetic diseases using AI, and Builders VC led a $10 million Series A in San Francisco's Notable Labs Inc., which is running drug combination tests on tumors with a proprietary platform.\par \par \uc2 Recursion's investors are betting the Utah startup could be a leader in the AI-powered therapeutics arena. Lux Capital Principal \uc2 Zavain Dar\uc2 , who is a Recursion board member, said, "In an era of \uc2 Google\uc2 -meets-\uc2 Genentech\uc2 , it is not unreasonable to believe that they could be the next big biotech company."\par \par \uc2 Write to Heather Mack at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Heather.Mack@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Heather.Mack@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171003eda3005v5\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The parent company of Jameson, Chivas Regal and Glenlivet used to have each brand purchase their own casks for aging, storing and shipping. That turned out to be an expensive exercise for the drinks company.\par \par \uc2 To better negotiate prices for casks, \uc2 Pernod Ricard SA\uc2  in 2015 decided to combine its purchases from a central base in Kentucky, even though the whiskeys are made in Canada, Scotland and Ireland.\par \par \uc2 The move is just one example of how centralizing costs helped the company shave off 2% to 3% of expenses tied to indirect procurement, said finance chief \uc2 Gilles Bogaert\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other companies, including \uc2 PayPal Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Royal Bank of Canada\uc2  are doing the same, concentrating certain business functions, such as finance, legal or human resources, in central hubs. Nearly 80% of companies that centralize business services include the finance group in that bundle, according to a study by consulting firm the \uc2 Hackett Group Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For many companies the move to centralize key business services follows years of cutting costs. Nearly a decade of lackluster consumer spending and weaker growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis has forced chief financial officers to double down on squeezing expenses to drive up profits.\par \par \uc2 "We want the center, the HQ, to have a stronger role in making that decision to make sure that at the end of the day, the group allocates funds to the best opportunities," said Pernod's Mr. Bogaert.\par \par \uc2 Consolidating control over operations or creating a specialized group to execute specific functions can help companies make smarter decisions and become more efficient, according to the Hackett study. And the cost savings can be substantial. Centralizing a specific business function can enhance productivity and save 6% to 10% a year, the study found.\par \par \uc2 Many companies also opt to place these hubs offshore in lower-cost countries, which can save 20% to 35%, the Hackett study said, adding that it was also a way to be more flexible and agile, particularly when acquiring new businesses.\par \par \uc2 "A good global business services unit adds a lot more than just cost savings," said \uc2 Penny Weller\uc2 , who leads Hackett's finance shared-services advisory program.\par \par \uc2 PayPal\uc2 , which operates in more than 200 markets across the world, is centralizing certain aspects of its finance function, said finance chief \uc2 John Rainey\uc2 . The online payments processor has a European headquarters in Luxembourg and an international headquarters Singapore.\par \par \uc2 The challenge in centralizing finance services is to supply leaders of those regions with the resources they require while meeting the need for "a single source of truth with data and not having a duplication of functions so we realize cost savings," Mr. Rainey said.\par \par \uc2 But other finance chiefs, including \uc2 Christopher Kastner\uc2  of \uc2 Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc\uc2 ., say their companies are better off without centralizing their business services. The U.S. ship builder organized itself into three reporting units, each with their own sector president and finance chief, when it spun off from \uc2 Northrop Grumman Corp\uc2 . in 2011.\par \par \uc2 "Our philosophy is to have clear accountability to each of those sector presidents for their profit and loss, and that includes programmatic and financial performance," Mr. Kastner said of the divisional CFOs.\par \par \uc2 The company continues to seek opportunities to cut costs or implement new tools, such as data \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2 , to improve efficiency, Mr. Kastner said.\par \par \uc2 Royal Bank of Canada\uc2  has been on the path to centralizing its business services for about five years, said finance chief \uc2 Rod Bolger\uc2 . The company has consolidated shared finance services that serve the whole bank as one team, such as accounts payable or fixed-asset accounting, he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Bolger is cautious when moving finance talent away from operations, which can reduce the value those employees could bring to the business.\par \par \uc2 "It's not all positive," he said. "Certainly you get efficiencies, but you also lose connectivity."\par \par \uc2 When finance employees lose their recurring interactions with operational teams the group can "become more of a utility" and unable to bring additional value to the business such as strategic advice, he said. "The trick is to find balance," he said.\par \par \uc2 Write to Tatyana Shumsky at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:tatyana.shumsky@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tatyana.shumsky@wsj.com}}}\uc2  and Nina Trentmann at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Document WSJO000020171003eda3000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Mr. Smith's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF17/20171003/106455/HHRG-115-IF17-Wstate-SmithR-20171003.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 prepared testimony}}}\uc2  indicated that the Struts security vulnerability in \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's software was neither identified nor patched after the first notification from the U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team. Multiple subsequent scans failed to identify the patch, according to his testimony.\par \par \uc2 Russia's HP Review: \uc2 Hewlett Packard Enterprise\uc2  authorized a Russian government-accredited testing firm to review source code for a software program used by the \uc2 U.S. Department of Defense\uc2  for potential weaknesses,\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia-hpe-specialreport/special-report-hp-enterprise-let-russia-scrutinize-cyberdefense-system-used-by-pentagon-idUSKCN1C716M"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Reuters reported}}}\uc2 . Researchers described the case as a "huge security vulnerability" over concerns that HPE gave "inner access and potential exploits to an adversary." HPE told Reuters questions about the possible security holes were "hypothetical and speculative in nature" and said the company always keeps clients informed of "any developments that may affect them."\par \par \uc2 New Encryption Alert: Sen. Ron Wyden, of Oregon, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLI-QAdX0AACgwV.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in a letter urged}}}\uc2  the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  to adopt to adopt a form of encryption known as STARTLS that Mr. Wyden said would "better protect the privacy and security of the Court's email communications." Mr. Wyden pointed to growing adoption of STARTLS in the private and public sectors in his letter, which comes after his office encouraged multi-factor authentication throughout the federal government.\par \par \uc2 Oracle\uc2 's Cyber Plan: \uc2 Oracle\uc2 's \uc2 Larry Ellison\uc2  opened his company's annual conference Sunday by announcing a new database that he said can autonomously patch its own security flaws, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-18c-database-patch-cybersecurity-flaws-2017-10"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 per Business Insider}}}\uc2 . Mr. Ellison said \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  makes it possible for \uc2 Oracle\uc2 's database to squash security bugs without going offline, and that the program will continuously improve itself without a human in control. "There is no pilot error anymore, because there is no pilot."\par \par \uc2 USPS Identity Questions: Security researchers and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 journalist Brian Krebs are asking}}}\uc2  whether the \uc2 U.S. Postal Service\uc2  offers sufficient identity protection measures as part of its new "Informed Delivery" offering. When identifying the correct user, the program, which aims to inform users about when their mail and packages is delivered, relies on a discredited form of validation known as "knowledge-based authentication," which Mr. Krebs noted is relatively easy to exploit. The Postal Service said it will include improved authentication techniques within months.\par \par \uc2 Insider Threat Hype Debunked: Recent disclosures of sensitive material removed from the \uc2 U.S. National Security Agency\uc2  highlight the difficulty of detecting insider threats, even for one of the most advanced intelligence agencies in the world. Two former NSA employees downloaded classified information, printed it and walked out of the headquarters at Fort Meade, Md. before they were identified as possible culprits. That's exactly how insider threat detection software is not supposed to work, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.cyberscoop.com/nsa-insider-threat-reality-winner-harold-martin/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 CyberScoop reports}}}\uc2 . Instead, the pricey programs meant to stop wrongdoing should identify suspicious behavior when it occurs.\par \par \uc2 Silk Road Proceeds: The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/acting-manhattan-us-attorney-announces-forfeiture-48-million-sale-silk-road-bitcoins"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. Department of Justice announced}}}\uc2  Friday the government has reaped $48,238,116 in proceeds from the sale of bitcoin confiscated from the Silk Road, a shuttered dark net website meant for drug sales. The arrest and conviction of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht marked the point when many in the general public learned about a digital underground where drugs were sold alongside hacking tools and other nefarious goods for cryptocurrency. The government's sale of the forfeited bitcoin comes at a time when the price, and awareness, of the virtual currency is near an all-time high.\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROCY20171003eda30002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Global investors are betting that Japan is on course to pull out of its long economic slump, reflecting hopes that growth is accelerating world-wide and sending stocks to multiyear highs.\par \par \uc2 Japan's economy, the world's third largest, grew at its fastest pace in two years in the second quarter and is on its longest expansion streak in more than a decade, spurred by its central bank's ultraloose monetary policy and a nascent recovery around the globe. Business and consumer spending has rebounded, a weaker currency has made Japanese exports more competitive abroad, and stimulus from the \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2  continues to support markets.\par \par \uc2 The combination has meant good news for Japanese stocks. The Nikkei Stock Average hit a new two-year high on Monday. The close was some 2.2% below the 2015 high, which was the highest since 1996.\par \par \uc2 Yet many remain cautious on Japan, where relatively cheap stocks and the promise of a resurgent economy have beguiled generations of bargain hunters. Rallies in the Nikkei over the past few years have come and gone, but the average has never approached the 1989 high of 38916, amid lackluster growth, low inflation and poor corporate governance. While Japan's stocks have traded at a nearly 40% discount to their global peers, flows from foreign investors have been sporadic, with few willing to buy into Japan for the long term.\par \par \uc2 Many investors would see a sustained rebound in Japan, where growth has lagged behind Europe and the U.S. for decades, as a sign that the global recovery from the financial crisis is picking up steam.\par \par \uc2 "The U.S. recovered, and then Europe came on and accelerated, and now it looks like the Japanese data is starting to come along," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. "Despite the facts staring them in the eyes, people hang on to the old story for too long before they realize a new story has developed."\par \par \uc2 The Japanese market's long funk has roots in the bursting of the "bubble economy" in the early 1990s. Land and stock prices collapsed, sending Japan's financial system into a tailspin from which it didn't fully recover until the early 2000s. Companies and consumers tried to pare debt, leading to deflation and a sense of stagnation, while political turmoil delayed shareholder-friendly policies.\par \par \uc2 Through false starts and years of subpar economic performance, many global investors have stayed away, even as Japanese companies have become more profitable.\par \par \uc2 Return on equity -- one measure of profitability -- has improved to around 8.4% in 2017 from just above 5% when Prime Minister \uc2 Shinzo Abe\uc2  took office in late 2012, according to research by \uc2 AllianceBernstein Holding L.P\uc2 . Yet Japanese stocks trade on average at 1.5 times book value, or the total value of their assets outside of what they owe -- a 36% discount to the developed- market average. Foreign investors remain thinly represented in Japanese equities despite a roughly 6.5% rally in the Nikkei in 2017, according to an AllianceBernstein analysis.\par \par \uc2 "Investors have left Japan for dead and are only now starting to come back," said Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein.\par \par \uc2 But "many investors are still skeptical," Mr. Zlotnikov said. "People have been burned over and over."\par \par \uc2 Even as signs of improvement mount, the \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2  continues to support markets by buying 6 trillion yen ($53 billion) in exchange-traded stock funds annually. Japanese companies have taken steps to make themselves more attractive to investors, such as adding outside directors to their boards and boosting returns through share buybacks.\par \par \uc2 Areas where Japanese companies are at the forefront include \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  and robotics. The country's auto-parts makers are poised to benefit from a move to electric vehicles, while cosmetic makers reap profits from selling to Asia's growing middle class, investors said.\par \par \uc2 Strong profit growth has helped drive up shares of \uc2 Sony Corp\uc2 . and cosmetics maker \uc2 Kose Corp\uc2 . this year. Year to date, those two stocks have gained roughly 28% and 31% respectively, according to FactSet.\par \par \uc2 Benjamin Segal, a senior portfolio manager at \uc2 Neuberger Berman\uc2 , says he has grown more optimistic on Japan and added select companies to his equity portfolio this year. "I'm emerging from the 'no way' camp into an incrementally more positive view," Mr. Segal said. "There does seem to be change afoot."\par \par \uc2 Better profit margins anddividend payouts that have improved from "pathetic to simply mediocre" all argue in Japan's favor, Mr. Segal said. Japanese companies "merit more of an inspection today they would have a year or two ago, or even 10 years ago," he said. Among the companies he owns are chemicals and cosmetics maker \uc2 Kao Corp\uc2 . and air-conditioner manufacturer \uc2 Daikin Industries Ltd\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, money managers own too few Japanese equities, and the yen is "grotesquely undervalued," Charles Gave, founder of research firm Gavekal, wrote in a note to investors. Corporate profits have grown faster in Japan than in the U.S. for the past five years, he said, while Japanese companies are sitting on around $4 trillion in cash. "The great beauty of these recommendations is that nobody. . .is positioned accordingly," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Japan's economy remains shaky, especially because wages haven't grown fast enough under Mr. Abe to spark solid consumer spending. Some investors are nervous about Mr. Abe's plans to push through a tax increase for 2019. A recession followed a sales-tax increase in 2014.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=WACO20171002000038"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document AWSJ000020171002eda300010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Investors are questioning whether property owners have fully absorbed the impact of the changes buffeting the retail industry - from the shift to e-commerce and rising inflation to falling consumer confidence.\par \par \uc2 Hermes Investment Management\uc2  agreed in September to sell 7.5 per cent of the Bluewater centre to insurer Royal London for \u163\'00\'A3155m - some 7 per cent below its original asking price.\par \par \uc2 The figure implies Bluewater's total worth is about 8 per cent lower than the value \uc2 Landsec\uc2  - the UK's largest listed property company - holds on its books for its 30 per cent stake and lower than the price it paid for the stake in 2014, according to an analysis by \uc2 Numis Securities\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Robert Duncan, analyst at Numis, said the price may begin a "slow bleed into valuations" across the UK's most upmarket shopping centres, most of which are owned by listed companies.\par \par \uc2 Falling values come partly from downward pressure on rents, Mr Duncan said: "Landlords face a substantial challenge if they are trying to gain any kind of rental growth."\par \par \uc2 Landlords of the UK's largest shopping centres - often listed companies such as \uc2 Landsec\uc2 , \uc2 British Land\uc2 , and retail specialists \uc2 Hammerson\uc2  and Intu - have so far argued they are less subject to the pressures affecting smaller, cheaper retail properties.\par \par \uc2 As retailers shrink their numbers of stores, landlords say, they are focusing on key locations as showrooms for their brands, plus hubs for click-and-collect deliveries.\par \par \uc2 "When we are having conversations with most of the prime retailers, they want more space [in our centres], not less," said \uc2 David Fischel\uc2  , chief executive of Intu.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Duncan and other analysts believe top shopping centres are not immune from the pressures affecting their smaller competitors.\par \par \uc2 Next, one of the UK's largest clothing chains and Intu's second-largest tenant, told investors earlier this year that stores were "an important part of our online service to the increasing number of customers who collect and return their orders through our stores". But this did not translate into a willingness to pay higher rents, it said, adding that it was agreeing rents for new stores opening in 2017-18 that were 24 per cent lower per square foot than existing ones.\par \par \uc2 So far, property companies have been cushioned by landlord-friendly contractual terms and have generally been able to secure small rises in average rents year on year. But they are losing some of their negotiating power, analysts say, while landlords' own expansion plans may not help.\par \par \uc2 According to Hemant Kotak, analyst at \uc2 Green Street Advisors\uc2 , big "Grade A" shopping centres plan extensions amounting to 12m sq ft in the next six years. "That's a material amount that you are adding," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Grade A malls are going to grab more and more market share, but can they grab it at a fast enough pace to offset the square feet they are adding?"\par \par \uc2 Shopping centre operators are also seeking to enhance the "experience" they offer customers, with more food and drink options, along with activities from cinemas to dry ski slopes. However, "casual dining" chains such as Byron Burger, which had helped drive this trend, are now slowing their expansion and even considering closing branches, according to reports.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to the shopping centre landlords, markets are sceptical that their assets are worth the prices currently on their books.\par \par \uc2 Intu is currently trading at a discount of 43 per cent to the book value of its assets, and \uc2 Hammerson\uc2  at a discount of 31 per cent, according to Numis figures, against an average 17 per cent discount for real estate investment trusts.\par \par \uc2 Capital values for prime UK shopping centres had already fallen by 3.5 per cent in the year to the end of June, according to figures from commercial property group CBRE - although rents continued to edge upwards by an average 1.8 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The Bluewater stake sold by Hermes came with no management power over the centre, which may have depressed its value. So investors are watching what happens to the next stake due to be sold.\par \par \uc2 The Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, GIC, and Australian group Lendlease are together selling stakes that amount to 42.5 per cent of the development for about \u163\'00\'A3900m, having earlier sought separate sales totalling more than \u163\'00\'A31bn.\par \par \uc2 In the sector as a whole, short sellers believe values have further to fall. In the US, there are similar worries about the future of Grade A shopping malls and internationally, short positions against retail real estate investment trusts have almost doubled this year to $12.4bn, according to financial \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  company S3 Partners. This includes $455m of current positions against Intu and $124m against \uc2 Hammerson\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Online shopping is more common in the UK than other countries including the US, Germany and France, according to figures assembled by research firm Green Street. But this does not mean the transition is over, said Richard Hyman, a retail consultant.\par \par \uc2 "We are seeing fundamental structural change," he said. "This is going to be painful, and it is going to last for some years."\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171002eda200018\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

There is a higher level of anxiety than I anticipated," says Mr Willcox, who leads a $1.6tn business that sits underneath the US bank's asset management and wealth unit led by \uc2 Mary Callahan Erdoes\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Pyongyang's bellicose rhetoric has barely dented investor confidence. The S&P 500 hit an all-time high shortly before North Korea's foreign minister accused Donald Trump , the US president, of declaring war .\par \par \uc2 JPMAM's default position is to advise clients to ignore the short-term volatility caused by such geo-political tensions, which, historically, have proved irrelevant for long-term returns to investors.\par \par \uc2 But Mr Willcox is concerned about developments in bond markets after his long years of experience managing fixed-income teams. He initially worked for \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  after leaving university and joined \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  in 2006 as global head of rates before assuming his current role in 2012.\par \par \uc2 "I am concerned about what fixed income markets are telling us," says the 49-year-old Englishman who has lived in New York since 2012. "The unwinding of accommodative monetary policy by central banks makes logical sense but it also presents a very asymmetric risk. There is no real evidence of inflation, so monetary tightening could very quickly lead to positive real interest rates and deflation, which would be very hard for the world to deal with."\par \par \uc2 JPMAM's assumption is that central banks will move extremely cautiously in normalising monetary policy. This lengthy process, combined with unfavourable demographic developments, high levels of debt and weak productivity growth, will slow the pace of economic recovery and weigh on returns from asset markets.\par \par \uc2 JPMAM is forecasting that nominal annualised returns from US bonds will average just 3 per cent over the next 10 to 15 years, while US equities are expected to deliver returns of around 6 per cent over the same period. This weak performance compared with historic returns will lead to further downward pressure on fees across asset management, says the father of two daughters.\par \par \uc2 "The whole investment industry will need to become more efficient over time. Asset management is still very profitable, with profit margins close to 30 per cent. But lower investment returns will intensify pricing pressures," he says, pointing to reductions of $270m in mutual fund fees by JPMAM over the past three years.\par \par \uc2 Around 90 per cent of JPMAM assets are actively managed, but Mr Willcox dismisses the suggestion that index-tracking funds are attracting more inflows because they offer better value to investors.\par \par \uc2 "People forget that the vast majority of passive products are not particularly cheap. Fees for active funds have also been going down. Pricing pressures across active and passive funds have proportionately been about the same," he says.\par \par \uc2 JPMAM is expanding its beta strategies and exchange traded fund business, and Mr Willcox sees a valuable role for both active and passive.\par \par \uc2 He estimates that US retail investors pay total costs of between about 150 and 250 basis points annually, with investment management fees accounting for just 40 bps.\par \par \uc2 "The rest sits between the end client and the product manufacturer. It is the person [distributor] in the middle that will be most affected," he says.\par \par \uc2 But he is sceptical about the potential for robo-advisers - which use algorithms to recommend a portfolio based on an investor's answers to an online questionnaire - to disrupt existing distribution channels.\par \par \uc2 "The technology behind robo-advice is pretty good but it is not super sophisticated. It is an efficient way to help investors, but these are services that asset managers could eventually give away for free. What is more interesting is if we can use \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2  to truly understand a client's spending patterns, their stock of wealth and their risk appetite. That would be a game-changing technology, but we are still a long way from that."\par \par \uc2 "It is active managers that will be best placed to harness \b \highlight22\uc2 big data\b0 \highlight\uc2  and \b \highlight22\uc2 artificial intelligence\b0 \highlight\uc2 . It will be those that can find new sources of information that can inform their decisions and make their investment process more efficient that will thrive."\par \par \uc2 Large investment managers such as JPMAM often draw on research and information gathered continuously across different time zones to run global portfolios that invest in multiple jurisdictions.\par \par \uc2 Under new European rules known as Mifid II , which come into force in January, payments for research must be separated out from trading costs so that clients understand clearly what they are being charged for.\par \par \uc2 JPMAM has decided to absorb the cost of third-party research rather than passing it on to clients.\par \par \uc2 "We want to do the right thing for clients. The previous model was outdated, so it was an easy decision for us," he says.\par \par \uc2 Mifid II will change the contours of the playing field.\par \par \uc2 "An asset manager like us that has invested heavily in its proprietary research platform as the main driver of investment insights and excess returns will be less worried by the Mifid changes than smaller managers. The ability of small managers to access a broad range of research over time will be compromised under Mifid."\par \par \uc2 Mr Willcox says that what asset managers really want is certainty.\par \par \uc2 "We seldom disagree with what regulators want to achieve, but what the industry and clients need is certainty, an even playing field that is not open to different interpretations. Markets are becoming increasingly global and we would like regulators to be more co-ordinated," he says.\par \par \uc2 CV\par \par \uc2 Born February 2 1968\par \par \uc2 Total pay Not disclosed\par \par \uc2 Education\par \par \uc2 1987-90 BSc (economics), \uc2 University College London\par \par \uc2 1990-91 MSc, \uc2 London School of Economics\par \par \uc2 Career\par \par \uc2 1991-2001 Fixed Income and foreign exchange, \uc2 Citigroup\par \par \uc2 2002-06 Global head of rates, currencies and commodities, Citigroup Asia-Pacific (based in Singapore)\par \par \uc2 2006-12 Global head of rates and foreign exchange, \uc2 JPMorgan\par \par \uc2 2012-14 Head of global fixed income and liquidity, \uc2 JPMorgan Asset Management\par \par \uc2 2012-14 Chief executive, JPMorgan Asset Management\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan Asset Management\par \par \uc2 Assets under management $1.6tn\par \par \uc2 Employees 7,600\par \par \uc2 Headquarters New York\par \par \uc2 Ownership JPMorgan Chase\par \par \uc2 Document FTFT000020171002eda200006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

"Under GDPR they want to elevate this person--give them more visibility and weight."\par \par \uc2 Faster Response\par \par \uc2 The main role of a data-protection officer is to monitor compliance with GDPR--a vast regulation that requires companies to disclose a breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of the incident, delete personal information upon request, and rigorously document cybersecurity practices, among other things.\par \par \uc2 "Their job is to keep the CEO and the board of directors apprised of the status of the organization--are they in the green zone, or are there problems," said Aaron Tantleff, a partner at \uc2 Foley & Lardner LLP\uc2  who specializes in privacy and information management.\par \par \uc2 In this capacity, a data-protection officer may well have been able to alert \uc2 Equifax\uc2 's top managers of vulnerabilities before hackers could exploit them, said Jeff Dennis, managing partner at Newmeyer & Dillion LLP and co-chair of its cybersecurity practice.\par \par \uc2 "My sense is if they had this person in place it would have ensured the software they were using would be secure," Mr. Dennis said, adding that a data-protection officer would have a key role in conducting security audits, penetration tests, and monitoring for software vulnerabilities. "It certainly is a vital role and one that companies need to carefully consider who they're going to appoint."\par \par \uc2 Having a data-protection officer in place could have also spared \uc2 Equifax\uc2  from reputational damage in more than one way, according to Marcus Christian, a partner at \uc2 Mayer Brown LLP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The company has come under investigation after several executives sold shares in the company after the breach was discovered but before it was disclosed. The company, which has formed a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-29/equifax-board-to-review-executives-stock-sales-following-hack"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 special committee}}}\uc2  to review the stock sales, initially said the executives were not aware of the hack when they sold nearly $2 million in shares days after underlings learned of the incident.\par \par \uc2 "We don't know if they had insider knowledge or not, but it looks bad," said Mr. Christian, adding that a data-protection officer would have likely ensured that key executives were informed of a breach shortly after its discovery. "It's not good on the reputational front, regardless of what happens."\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  was also criticized by politicians and potential victims for the amount of time it took to disclose the breach, for example. Under the GDPR, data-protection officers must disclose a data breach to supervisory authorities "not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it," along with the measures that will be taken "to mitigate its possible adverse effects."\par \par \uc2 Equifax\uc2  was infiltrated in March, discovered the breach on July 29, and disclosed it on Sept. 7, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-entered-equifax-systems-in-march-1505943617"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Wall Street Journal}}}\uc2  reported.\par \par \uc2 "Companies are looking at this incident and it's increasing the sense of urgency in reporting a breach," said Mr. Christian. "Being perceived as not notifying affected people or regulators soon enough is problematic."\par \par \uc2 DPO Scapegoats\par \par \uc2 Data-protection officers could also end up in a situation where they're blamed after a data breach if something goes wrong.\par \par \uc2 Equifax chief executive \uc2 Richard Smith\uc2  said last week he would leave the company--a move meant to show that the firm's leadership would be held accountable for the breach, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-ceo-richard-smith-to-retire-following-massive-data-breach-1506431571"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Wall Street Journal}}}\uc2  reported.\par \par \uc2 Since data-protection officers are meant to advise chief executives on vulnerabilities and data breaches, they may end up as easy scapegoats.\par \par \uc2 One factor that prevents this practice from being abused is that the regulation forbids companies from firing or penalizing data-protection officers for performing their duties.\par \par \uc2 "What it comes down to is if they did their job or not," said Mr. Tantleff.\par \par \uc2 The answer to that question could depend on the affected organization, though, and the specific situation.\par \par \uc2 Kenneth Sanford, U.S. lead \b \highlight22\uc2 analytics\b0 \highlight\uc2  architect at Dataiku Inc., a data science software company that helps clients with GDPR compliance, said the job of a data-protection officer is an "impossible role" and it would be easy for a chief executive to say they failed to carry out their assigned tasks.\par \par \uc2 "These are giant responsibilities--you have to show what information you have, how you use it, and delete it if someone requests it," he said. "The big question is will these individuals be given the funding to realistically do these tasks."\par \par \uc2 (Adam Janofsky writes about cybersecurity for WSJ Pro, with a speciality in small business.

He discussed his outlook on interest rates, the Fed's plans to reduce its bondholdings and cybersecurity. The conversation was moderated by Mukul Pandya, editor-in-chief at the \uc2 Wharton School\uc2 's Knowledge@Wharton online journal. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity.\par \par \uc2 MUKUL PANDYA: So we've been talking a lot about fintech. And maybe we should start by taking a little rest from that before we come back to fintech. And let's talk about what's on top of everyone's mind when \u8211\'20\'13 especially when they hear from you. And when they think about you as a Fed president, the thought that comes to mind is inflation. So what do \u8211\'20\'13 I mean, this week, as Chair [Janet] Yellen said on Tuesday, I think, that the Fed may have overstated the strength of the labor market and the rate of inflation. It has come down to \u8211\'20\'13 I think this year to 1.4 percent. What do you think is happening on the inflation front? And are rate increases justified this year or next year? What are your views?\par \par \uc2 PATRICK T. HARKER\uc2 : So what's happening in monetary policy land?\par \par \uc2 Well, first, let me thank, Mukul, you and Dick. By the way, I'm still doing railroads. Instead of steel rails, they're financial rails, right? (Laughter.) They're rails of the payment system. So it's all railroading. And I want to thank Julapa and the whole team and all our sponsors and supporters. This was a great conference.\par \par \uc2 So what's happening in monetary policy? And I'll put the inflation picture in context. So, if we think about GDP [gross domestic product] growth, GDP growth continues along just as we pretty much have anticipated, according to our forecasts: running slightly above trend, around 4 \u8211\'20\'13 2.3, 2.4 [percent], you can pick a number somewhere north of 2. Q1 was weak. Q1 is always weak. You should recognize that we have a seasonal issue with measurement of GDP in quarter one, and so take that with a grain of salt. Q2 was just revised up slightly to slightly over 3 percent, 3.1 percent. So, in terms of GDP, things seem to be going along just fine.\par \par \uc2 Now, of course, the devastation that we're seeing from these hurricanes \u8211\'20\'13 this horrific devastation \u8211\'20\'13 is obviously terrible for the people who are involved, and our thoughts go out to them. But in terms of the economy as a whole, the best estimate right now is that we'll see about 100-basis-point decline in GDP this quarter, and then it'll bounce back to about 1.3 percent in a subsequent quarter, some number around there. So it will have an effect, but it will be a transitory effect as that works through the economy. So that's on the GDP front.\par \par \uc2 On employment, I think the best \u8211\'20\'13 I can say, by the way, everything I say are my views alone and the views of nobody else \u8211\'20\'13 (laughter) \u8211\'20\'13 in the Federal Reserve system or on the Federal Open Market Committee. But with respect to employment, we're running below what most people would think is the natural rate of unemployment. The labor markets feel really tight. And that's not only in the data in terms of unemployment, but if you look at the JOLTS [job openings and labor turnover survey] data, the job opening and quits data, things are really tight. And you're hearing this. I mean, yes, the plural of anecdote is not data, but we're hearing this over and over and over again of the skills mismatch question. Companies can't find the skilled workers. And, again, we're not talking about Ph.D. economists and computer scientists. We're talking about truck mechanics, electricians, plumbers. You can go down the list. There's just a real \u8211\'20\'13 it's a very tight market.\par \par \uc2 Now, we get to the inflation question. So if that's true, where did the Philips curve go, right? What happened to it? Why \u8211\'20\'13 did it just disappear? Well, the conventional wisdom is it's flat. That it's been flat for a while. And that relationship between unemployment and inflation we're just not seeing. So what's happening with wages? Well, they are flat. But some recent work that was done by our colleagues in San Francisco point out the fact that if you look at somebody who's staying in a job through a sustained period of time, their wages are going up well above what we're seeing on average. It may be just a compositional shift. Part of the story of the wage issue is that we, the boomers, are retiring \u8211\'20\'13 high-price boomers being replaced by lower-price millennials \u8211\'20\'13 and that is keeping the average down for now. Again, there needs to be more work in this area, but we are starting to hear and see some wage pressure.\par \par \uc2 Now, there's some recent work done by \uc2 Mike Dotsey\uc2  and his colleagues here at the Philly Fed research department on the Philips curve. And so the conclusion of that work is if it's \u8211\'20\'13 whether it's dead of not, for the last several decades it's not been a very good predictor of inflation, period. And there may be other metrics and other measures that are better predictors of inflation than what we've traditionally thought of with the Philips curve. So that is the one thing, if you think of our dual mandate, that is problematic, is inflation.\par \par \uc2 The job market seems to be incredibly healthy on average \u8211\'20\'13 again, there are pockets where we need to bring people off the sidelines into the labor force and help them get the skills they need to \u8211\'20\'13 and that's something we're doing here in Philadelphia with what we're calling the economic growth and mobility project, is working with communities trying to do research and outreach in that area. Things like apprenticeship programs. We just put out a report on apprenticeship programs. They are not just in \u8211\'20\'13 they're not your mother and father's apprenticeship programs. They're no longer just in the trades. But you're seeing it in IT, in health care, financial services. Apprenticeships are now becoming, as the market's gotten tight, one way for companies to get the talent they need.\par \par \uc2 So on inflation we are running below our 2 percent target. Now, only for bankers and central bankers is this a concern, that oh my gosh we're behind on the 2 percent target. The average American walking out in the street right there is saying: I have a job. Inflation's 1\u189\'00\'BD percent. Life is good. And the Eagles won an amazing game last week, right? (Laughter.) So what's wrong with this picture? Everything's great. Well, of course, there are risks to \u8211\'20\'13 when it comes to \u8211\'20\'13 bankers would like higher margins \u8211\'20\'13 obviously, spreads. And we have risk of if and when another negative shocks hits the economy having the legroom to be able to move rates down. That is a problem.\par \par \uc2 So inflation is the one area that does give us a little bit of pause \u8211\'20\'13 gives me pause. And it's a complicated story, right? And it may be that the Philips curve or Philips curve-like mechanisms will reassert themselves. There's also work being done here in Philly led by Leonard Nakamura that is pretty persuasive that we may be overstating inflation, even as low as it is. And as a result, we may be understating productivity growth in the economy\par \par \uc2 And, you know, Leonard's favorite example is the iPhone. We no longer have GPS. We no longer have all these other things. It's all on the phone. We no longer have a Game Boy. I used that once at a college campus and nobody knew what I was talking about. (Laughter.) So we no longer have all those things because we have the iPhone 10 years out. But we don't know how to capture that shift in the statistics. We can do it hedonically, in retrospect. But in real time, for policy makers, we're having a hard time figuring out how to capture that.\par \par \uc2 So I think that, then, leads me to be \u8211\'20\'13 as a policy maker to say, well, given that, let's just let things play out a little bit. Let's just see how the data evolves over the next several periods. Today's PCE [personal-consumption expenditures] report was weak, so we'll have to see how this plays out.\par \par \uc2 I think hitting a pause for a little bit on the fed-funds path is appropriate for two reasons. One, see the data play out. Second, we are unwinding our balance sheet, and that process will start, as we announced last week after the FOMC, in October. And so I think it's time to just let that play out. We'll start that process. That process \u8211\'20\'13 as I've said to other audiences, we want to do this in a way that is as exciting as watching paint dry, all right? I mean, we want to lay this out very clearly, what it is, the caps are very low.\par \par \uc2 And the best estimate that I've seen is that will have an impact the equivalent of a 25-basis-point increase in the fed-funds rate over a 5-year or 4-year period. So we're not talking about a very large impact. But we don't know for sure. And I think prudence would call for just letting that happen, see how the markets react. I've still penciled in an increase in December and three increases for '18, assuming that inflation comes back. But I do emphasize the word "pencil in." We'll just have to see how things evolve.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: So we'll keep the pencil fairly light for now. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Right.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: But just to follow up on the last point you made about the unwinding or the winding down or the $4.5 trillion balance sheet, how long do you think the process will take?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: It'll take a while. It will take several years. And again, going \u8211\'20\'13 the question is not so much the timing, but what are we going back to, right? That's what you really need to know.\par \par \uc2 And there, if you just do the math, so our currency liability, say \u8211\'20\'13 call it 1\u189\'00\'BD trillion, and then we have about $400 billion in the Treasury account, plus some other foreign, reverse repo, and there's little things here and there. So we get up to some number, call it $2 trillion, right?\par \par \uc2 So how \u8211\'20\'13 the question is, how \u8211\'20\'13 what do we need in order to effectively run monetary policy, right, to execute monetary policy? Well, this gets into a debate about whether you want a floor \u8211\'20\'13 a floor system or a corridor system, and you need to know that elasticity of the demand for reserves. We've been way out, right, on that curve \u8211\'20\'13 (laughs) \u8211\'20\'13 for now quite a while. So we're not quite sure, in this economy, what that elasticity is. We're on the flat end for sure. And there's some view \u8211\'20\'13 and I'm sympathetic to this view \u8211\'20\'13 that a floor system makes some sense.\par \par \uc2 The issue is we don't know when we stop being in a floor system and go into a corridor system. That is when the elasticity increases. Again, there's some recent research by some of our economists here that said, you know, that number could be as high as a trillion dollars. We just don't know. And others will say, well, it could be as low as a hundred billion. So, given the tried-and-true scientific method of picking the middle, right, you pick some number in the middle and it would get you to a balance sheet of 2.5-ish, somewhere around there, going forward. So what's really when we \u8211\'20\'13 but we'll know it when we get there. I mean, we'll be able to see how the market's reacting. We'll be able to respond appropriately.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: Looping back now briefly to the topic of fintech, which is \u8211\'20\'13 we have had some fascinating conversations over the last couple of days on this. I mean, one thing that has struck me in listening to all the wonderful speakers is sometimes it seems like we almost have this tsunami of financial technology innovation going on everywhere, but to what extent do you see it as being revolutionary and truly disruptive, and to what extent is it evolutionary and something that can be integrated into the existing financial system? I mean, it would be wonderful to have your overall perspective on that issue.\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Yes. (Laughter.) I think it can be both, right? It doesn't have to be one or the other. There are clearly important \u8211\'20\'13 and we've heard from people here \u8211\'20\'13 important innovations happening in the market. That said, financial services have been in the business of innovating with technology for a long, long time, right? This is not something new to financial services. It feels different now because of just it's not the traditional banking institutions and other institutions that are doing it. There are new entrants into the market. As I think the conversation yesterday when I was here we were talking about, but I think people are finding out \u8211\'20\'13 not everybody, but \u8211\'20\'13 they're very good at innovation to the customer. But then I've got all this compliance stuff and I've got all this other stuff that I have to worry about, and it may be better to partner with the institutions that know how to do that and also get scale.\par \par \uc2 And this is not \u8211\'20\'13 this is not very different than many other industries, whether it's retail or you can sort of go through the history of this innovation. There are going to be the Amazons of the world that emerge, but then others will figure out how to adopt this technology or partner with people and be successful.\par \par \uc2 The fundamentals don't change very much, right? People still want some basic things out of the financial system. You know, access to credit. They want to be able to pay their bills. They want to have safe and secure funds, right? And they want \u8211\'20\'13 and they want to have other services that can help them succeed, whether they're a business, small business, or a consumer. So I think those fundamentals are still there. It's just how we deliver them is changing. And that will continue to evolve. So I think it can be both.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: So, in addition to the revolution versus evolution issue, the other big thing that has come up in the past couple of days is what are the key benefits of fintech and how do you \u8211\'20\'13 how do you see the tradeoff between the risks \u8211\'20\'13 I mean, the benefits and the biggest risks of fintech?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: I think there's clearly \u8211\'20\'13 and you can see the uptake, again, not only in the traditional banks, but also in the new entrants \u8211\'20\'13 there's clearly a desire, and I'm one of them, to \u8211\'20\'13 I don't walk into a branch unless I guess I want to yell at somebody. That's about the only reason I would. (Laughter.) I mean, so I'm \u8211\'20\'13 I enjoy having access to all the mobile platforms and all the ability to do that, and I think that's the advantage that we're seeing across the board, right?\par \par \uc2 And so hopefully we'll also see an advantage of people who are marginalized in the financial system being able to get access to the financial system. I think, for me, that's more aspirational right now, but I think it's really important. And I think it's important for the system that we continue have ubiquity, that everybody can have access and plug into the financial system. And in particular, if there are entrants coming into the market who can bring the unbanked into the market, help educate them about how to create a sound financial future for themselves, we're all better off as an economy.\par \par \uc2 The risk \u8211\'20\'13 I think the large risk \u8211\'20\'13 is that many \u8211\'20\'13 not all, but many of the new entrants were born in a period where they've never seen a deep down-side of a business cycle. And banks generally have been through that. They know how to manage that risk. If there's a concern I have, it's that the institutions \u8211\'20\'13 to make sure they have the proper risk procedures and policies to protect themselves when that happens. We will \u8211\'20\'13 I'm not saying when, because nobody really knows when \u8211\'20\'13 but we will have that down side of the business cycle. And to make sure that institutions are protected, and hence consumers are protected, in that process I think is critical.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: "Fintech" is such a sort of catch-all phrase. It's so vast.\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: So in the next few minutes I was wondering if we could drill a little deeper into some specific areas of fintech. And one question that came up yesterday that was very interesting was in the session with the OCC's [\uc2 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\uc2 ] acting comptroller. There was some discussion about the fact that \uc2 Barclays\uc2 , \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , and many other large financial institutions have now formed a consortium to create a digital currency. Japan also \u8211\'20\'13 as you may have seen in the Financial Times this week, some leading Japanese banks are creating their own digital currency \u8211\'20\'13 I think it's called J-Coin \u8211\'20\'13 with the support of Japan's central bank. Looking to the U.S., do you believe that the creation of these digital currencies will threaten the ability of central banks to maintain control of money supply?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: I'm not sure yet. At this point, I would be on the side of sort of doubting that for a couple of reasons. One, I agree with the acting comptroller that we should let the market evolve and see how this technology evolves and we should not \u8211\'20\'13 whether we can create a sandbox or other ways of doing it so that people can have the ability to innovate.\par \par \uc2 That said, I think you have to \u8211\'20\'13 some of the fundamentals haven't changed. For the economy as a whole, the paper that's in your pocket that we call money only has value because we believe it has value, because we believe that the government stands behind it, right? It's all trust issue. And so whether cryptocurrencies and other forms of currency emerge, I think the basis of that has to be how do they create that trust. In the case of a central bank issued digital currency, it is the government standing behind it, right? The sovereign state standing behind it. You could have other models of that happening, but they have to play out over time. And because, again, everything can work in good times. It's when the bad times hit.\par \par \uc2 And the other issue I am personally concerned about is \u8211\'20\'13 whether it's a government-issued or central-bank issued digital currency or another large player comes in and issues this digital currency \u8211\'20\'13 when things really go back, where do Americans turn, right? I mean, if things really turned out bad? Well, they're going to come back to the government. That's been the history of the country in recent vintage. And so we'd have to think through that. And again, this is one where we're not ready for this year. We're seeing it evolve. But it is something we continue to study, and I continue to study and learn from, and the experience of others who have done this.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: To make sure that things don't go back, the role of the regulator is very critical. And the question there is, how can you regulate in such a way that you mitigate the risks that you are talking about? And even more fundamentally, how do you regulate an algorithm? (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: That's a good question. I don't know yet. I think the answer is we have to continue to study this. And as these technologies evolve and the innovation evolves in the market, we need to continue to work and study how this is evolving. The issue of regulating algorithms is interesting. One of my colleagues, a computer scientist, is doing some interesting work on fairness in \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms. If you think about all of you in this room, and everybody's adopting \b \highlight22\uc2 machine learning\b0 \highlight\uc2  algorithms.\par \par \uc2 But how do you plug into that some sense of fairness, right, whether it's a \u8211\'20\'13 required by a regulatory constraint or just you believe that's part of your business \u8211\'20\'13 the right way of doing business? That's actually a lot harder than it sounds, apparently. It's a very difficult thing to do. So before you even think about how do you regulate an algorithm, how would you even build an algorithm that would have that sense of fairness in it is a technical, but a fairly deep technical question.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: The fairness issue is especially interesting because the presentation that we just heard this morning about how important financial inclusion is as a dimension of fintech. I mean, we just heard presentations from, you know, companies that are being so proactive in bringing unbanked and underbanked populations, at lowering their costs of borrowing, et cetera. How do you see the relationship between fintech and financial inclusion?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Oh, I think done right and done well it can have a tremendous impact. But we also have to recognize that we are human beings \u8211\'20\'13 we are flawed human beings, and there are also players in the market who are behaving in different ways. And so you hear these stories all the time. I hear these stories constantly of small business in particular getting into a situation where they didn't quite know what they signed up for, and then they walk into their community bank and say I got to get out of this deal, it's killing me. I signed up online for this thing and I thought it sounded good, but I didn't really understand it, I guess. And now I'm really in trouble.\par \par \uc2 And so here are good actors and bad actors in any industry. Financial services is not very different from anything else. And I think that is the role of the regulators. And not just at the national level, but even if there was no national, you know, OCC charter for a fintech company, there's still state regulatory requirements with respect to fairness to the consumer and so forth. So there's always going to be some form of regulation. And my message to the fintech companies is get involved with the regulators early and often to start forming what makes sense to protect the people who want to do it right, right?\par \par \uc2 Because I think that can protect the innovation, right, this sphere of innovation that you all need, and we want as an economy. But if there's too many bad actors in there, that can stifle that innovation, right? It can squash \u8211\'20\'13 because we know how regulation goes. It's always been this case. We tend to overreact to a crisis. When something bad happens, the pendulum swings too far. It's better to be in the conversation right now about what those regulations look like now, whether it's at the national level or at the state level.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: Well, one other thing about consumers especially need to be protected is because of what's happening with cybersecurity, especially in the wake of what's happened with Equifax. What is your view about the cybersecurity environment and how should consumers be protected?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: So I think one of the big challenges for consumers right now, and actually this \u8211\'20\'13 we had a pretty robust conversation with a group of bankers the other day. So everybody can try to protect that account at that bank. But the consumer needs to figure out how to protect themselves. And increasingly, that's not just in financial data, but it's health data. You can go down the list of all the things, your identity. It creates challenges for the consumer and for the financial institutions. We were talking, I know, throughout the conference on AML [anti-money laundering] and BSA [Bank Secrecy Act]. That's going to get harder. I mean, much harder.\par \par \uc2 How do you really know your customer? I mean, especially if you've never \u8211\'20\'13 even if you physically see them. Given how much data and information is now out there about all of us, how do we \u8211\'20\'13 how do we change the system? How do we innovate to protect my identity \u8211\'20\'13 not just my financial identity. So all of us, because we got hacked here when OPM [\uc2 U.S. Office of Personnel Management\uc2 ] got hacked. So everybody in the Fed has their credit fraud detection and so forth. But we have to continue to innovate in this space, too.\par \par \uc2 I actually worry about this a lot, because if we don't do this, again, a lot of the innovation that you are all fostering can be really stifled when customers just say, eh, I'm going back to microfiche and coin, right? (Laughter.) Because I've been hacked so many times and I've lost so much money and it's such a hassle to keep trying to clean up my credit or my health records or my false tax returns that somebody put into the IRS that, man, I'm just dropping out of this. That would be a dangerous step, I think, for the industry \u8211\'20\'13 all of you. What it means, though, is some innovative players have to come in with, I think, different ways of thinking about how to protect their identity.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: Just a couple of final questions before we open it up for everyone else. Looking to the future, maybe two or three years, what is your most optimistic and your most pessimistic scenario about fintech? And between the two, since you said "yes" to one question before, what is your most realistic scenario? (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: So I think the optimistic one is \u8211\'20\'13 we were just talking about, that fintech not only reaches the consumers that have deep pockets, but also starts to bring the marginalized consumer into the market, right, and that financial inclusion. That that's critically important for the economy. The negative is that, again, whatever it is, there's continued hacking or there are regulatory issues that stop the innovation in this industry, right, that this \u8211\'20\'13 you can see \u8211\'20\'13 if we don't get this right and if the consumer doesn't learn to trust these innovations, they simply will not happen, right? And so it's all a trust game.\par \par \uc2 And so I think that's \u8211\'20\'13 the realistic scenario is there are going to be people who do it well. There are going to be people who that don't do it well. People who succeed. People who don't. That's the market. And I think we just need to make sure that we, as regulators, continue to make the playing field level and not get in the way to the extent we stifle this innovation.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: And can we ask one last question before we open it up? What is the biggest prevailing myth about fintech? And if you could say one thing today to dispel it, what would that be?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: So, for my kids somehow it's that money magically appears in an account. (Laughter.) So I think that that's probably the biggest myth. Like, I don't know \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: That's not really related to fintech. (Laughter.)\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Right. At least when they had to steal it out of my, you know, drawer in my bedroom \u8211\'20\'13 (laughs) \u8211\'20\'13 but now it's just \u8211\'20\'13 you know, that somehow a lot of the basic rules of financial services don't seem to apply.\par \par \uc2 Also, the other myth \u8211\'20\'13 which I am very concerned about with my three Millennial children \u8211\'20\'13 is not all technology is equal. Some of \u8211\'20\'13 some of this stuff you're putting yourself out there at tremendous risk because it's not very secure. They don't think about that. And so I think that's one of the bit myths that I know you are all concerned about, and we're concerned about as well.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: That's a great point.\par \par \uc2 And on that note, let's open it up. And who wants to go first?\par \par \uc2 Q: Hey. Michael at CoinDesk here. And thank you for asking about the work with Utility Settlement Coin.\par \par \uc2 I'm also curious what your thoughts are on the possibility of maybe someday issuing fiat on a blockchain. Is that something that you're exploring?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Well, I think there's work going on right now in terms of more exploration of \u8211\'20\'13 and watching what is evolving in the market, not just here in the U.S. but globally. I don't think we're ready to do that yet, but it is worth continuing to study. I don't think at this point, though \u8211\'20\'13 I would say, at least for me personally, I don't \u8211\'20\'13 I don't know enough yet and I don't think we collectively know enough yet to be able to make that decision.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: Right here.\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Here.\par \par \uc2 Q: This is Will (sp) from University of Chicago.\par \par \uc2 I do have a question for President Harker. You mentioned about the optimistic outcome where there's more financial inclusion. I think there's also a lot of discussion related to fintech democratizing financial services, or kind of disintermediation, so to distribute the surplus to either consumers or some new entrants in the market. What's your view on that? Is that a function that fintech is already performing and can optimistically perform well in future?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Yeah, and it's a good question. So I think you really have to break down the services. I don't think you give, at least in my mind, an answer for financial services writ large, right? It's service by service, or what kind of things could be, will be disintermediated, or continued disintermediation. I mean, that's the other thing. It's not like all of a sudden that this is happening; it's been happening for a while. So it really \u8211\'20\'13 I think it really depends on the actual service itself.\par \par \uc2 And that, to me, comes down to you look at \u8211\'20\'13 take two completely different industries. Having just bought and sold a house, I used a real estate agent. Why? Because I don't buy and sell a house very often. As opposed to I don't use a travel agent. Why? Because I travel a lot. And so I think some of it is the familiarity with the service for the consumer and the opaqueness of the information. That's very clear in the real-estate business; you don't see a lot of \u8211\'20\'13 there's not a lot of transparency into some of the things that happen.\par \par \uc2 So I think if you map out \u8211\'20\'13 you parse out what financial services provide, there are going to be some services that people use on a routine basis, they easily can get the trust to do it, they can \u8211\'20\'13 and people can be disintermediated. There are others that people do on a very infrequent basis. And there, there may be some disintermediation, but often if I'm really sort of lost I need to find somebody that knows what they're doing because I don't think I know what I'm doing, right?\par \par \uc2 Because the disintermediation assumes \u8211\'20\'13 makes a big assumption, right, in my mind, that everybody is a rational actor that can be fully informed on this thing. Well, that's just not true, right? There's, A, some things that I \u8211\'20\'13 real estate is a good example. No matter how hard I try, those local agents have more inside information about the market than I can ever get, right? And so I just \u8211\'20\'13 there's no way, no matter which website I go on, I can't find out about the plumber who put in that work in that house, whether it was good or bad, right? It's just hard.\par \par \uc2 And the second thing is there are a lot of things I could do it, but I just don't want \u8211\'20\'13 it's just not worth my time to worry about it, right? So, yeah, I \u8211\'20\'13 because it takes so many cycles of my brain to think about this, and I only have so many in my life, and I'm not going to spend some on these things, right? I'm just going to \u8211\'20\'13 I'm just going to let somebody else do it and not worry about it.\par \par \uc2 So I think it really depends on those specific markets and the tastes of the consumers, right? So it's \u8211\'20\'13 there will be different flavors for different people. There will be different kinds of people, but there will be different players in the market, too, and there will be a matching issue.\par \par \uc2 So I think there will clearly be disintermediation. That's just in the nature of what we've seen in many other evolutions of technology. But how it turns out, it'll really depend on the specific service.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: Want to go \u8211\'20\'13 yeah, he has a question here.\par \par \uc2 Q: Thank you, President Harker, for these very interesting remarks.\par \par \uc2 Going back to Mukul's question about the framework that the Fed would eventually return to, on Wednesday the \uc2 New York Fed\uc2  published a blog post that linked the ability to pay the interest on excess reserves exclusively to going back to a floor system. I was wondering if you think that the Fed would need \u8211\'20\'13 continue to need the ability to pay interest on excess reserves if they went back to a corridor system. Or would a corridor system with a floor at zero be acceptable?\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Yeah, that's a really good question. So, I mean, just to put it in context for those who are not deeply immersed in monetary policy world, if you're in a floor system, what defines the floor? Well, it should be the fed funds rate, but the trading in the fed funds rate, the reason there's no demand is there's very little trading in the fed funds market. So Congress, prior to the Great Recession, gave the Fed the authority to pay interest on excess reserves, and during the crisis asked the Fed to accelerate its implementation so that we have that tool. That creates a floor. It's a leaky floor because it's only open to certain players in the market. The overnight reverse repo market actually provides the floor floor. So the fed funds trade between those two.\par \par \uc2 So, if we went \u8211\'20\'13 if we truly went back to something that was a corridor system, we wouldn't need to have that tool in the same way, assuming we can stay in that corridor system. I think right now it is imprudent to remove that tool in any way, shape or form. I mean, it is what we have right now. Without it, we will have a very difficult time \u8211\'20\'13 the New York Desk would have an incredibly difficult time trying to execute what the Federal Open Market Committee says. Raise \u8211\'20\'13 I mean, so the committee says: Open Market Desk, thou shalt raise the fed funds within this 25-basis-point range. And they need the tools to do that. Right now, IOER [interest rate on excess reserves] is really the only one they have, along with the overnight reverse repo.\par \par \uc2 MR. PANDYA: Maybe one last question, perhaps. No, I think you \u8211\'20\'13 oh, yeah.\par \par \uc2 Q: You know, one of \u8211\'20\'13 in one of your responses to a question earlier you said something about come and talk to the regulators frequently. The problem, as I \u8211\'20\'13 as I see it, is that which regulator? So many of these \u8211\'20\'13 many of these new business models we see sort of fall in the interstices between different types of models. Is bitcoin a security? Is it a currency? So who do you talk to? I mean, there doesn't seem to be that much coordination between the regulatory agencies in trying to figure out what to do in this scenario here.\par \par \uc2 MR. HARKER: Yeah. You know, that's a \u8211\'20\'13 that is a fair criticism, but actually that's why I think meetings like this are really important. Because when I meet and talk, it isn't that we just have to sit over coffee and chat, you know, one on one. But I think we are collectively trying to figure this out, right? I mean, I think it is a fair criticism that we haven't completely figured it out because, frankly, nobody's completely figured it out because it's a fast-moving target. And so I think these kind of gatherings really matter. And the follow up from these kind of gatherings, continuing the conversations, really are important.\par \par \uc2 I think there is a movement within the supe and reg community across at least the federal agencies to have some \u8211\'20\'13 start to have some deeper conversations. But honestly, in this case, you know, as still a dyed-in-the-wool academic, I actually think the academic community can play an incredibly important role here in both providing the research, the different perspectives, and some of the convening. Yes, we can do these convenings, but I think it's also important for academic institutions to play a critical role in this area. Again, when you see this kind of summit, hazy future of what this is going to look like \u8211\'20\'13 and that's starting to happen. I mean, one of my colleagues, Bill Laufer at Wharton, just had a conference. He's a lawyer, and so they had a conference that's more on the regulatory front at Penn last week. The more of those we have, the more we talk about this, the better off we'll be.\par \par \uc2 Related Article\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-harker-sees-next-rate-rise-coming-in-december-1506703347"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Harker Sees Next Rate Rise Coming in December}}}\par \par \uc2 Document RSTPROFR20170929ed9t00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

(\u8220\'20\'1CWhile discussions could get spirited, we viewed that as a good thing and all directors including Nelson were always open-minded to others\u8217\'20\'19 perspectives,\u8221\'20\'1D they wrote.)\par \par \uc2 The fund has also won over the proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which recommended late last week that \uc2 P&G\uc2  shareholders vote for Peltz to join the board. While the more influential proxy advisory firm, \uc2 ISS\uc2 , has yet to publish their recommendation, industry insiders are already predicting Peltz will get his coveted board seat \u8212\'20\'14 not because of any specific plan he is proposing, but more out of a \u8220\'20\'1CWhy not?\u8221\'20\'1D mentality by shareholders, they say.\par \par \uc2 But Peltz\u8217\'20\'19s record in proxy fights is thin \u8212\'20\'14 he won one at Heinz more than a decade ago, while losing his fight to get a board seat at \uc2 DuPont\uc2  in 2015.\par \par \uc2 He was quick to anger \uc2 P&G\uc2  in the fight, too \u8212\'20\'14 by claiming the white ballot card. While whichever side files their proxy statement first can claim the ballot colour they\u8217\'20\'19d like, the company typically picks white, leaving the activist to claim\u160\'00\'A0another colour. It definitely caused some consternation, said an insider.\par \par \uc2 P&G\uc2  has fought back, filing a 106-page document with the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  last week castigating Peltz\u8217\'20\'19s record on company boards, suggesting he added little value by being a director at similar companies, and saying he \u8220\'20\'1Chas not produced any new ideas that make sense for \uc2 P&G\uc2 \u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Welcome to Due Diligence.

Get in touch with the team:\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Energy M&A: Not a Total secret\par \par \uc2 Total\u8217\'20\'19s $7.5bn acquisition of oil and gas assets from \uc2 AP Moller-Maersk\uc2  of Denmark last month is still generating lots of chatter in the industry.\par \par \uc2 The surprise deal, involving about 1bn barrels of reserves in the unfashionable North Sea region, is being seen as a sign that the global oil majors are beginning to feel pressure to replenish their resource bases after a period of retrenchment since the 2014 oil price crash.\par \par \uc2 Just as interesting for dealmakers was the cloak-and-dagger manner in which Total snared its prey. Chief executive \uc2 Patrick Pouyann\u233\'00\'E9\uc2  (pictured) kept negotiations in an even tighter circle than is usual for such deals, with much of the company\u8217\'20\'19s top leadership kept in the dark until the last minute.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s because of you,\u8221\'20\'1D Pouyann\u233\'00\'E9\u160\'00\'A0joked to the FT\u8217\'20\'19s Anne-Sylvaine Chassany, when asked about his secretive approach, implying that he wanted to avoid leaks. \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t need many people to know internally\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t alone, there\u8217\'20\'19s a competent CFO, chief legal counsel at Total.\u8221\'20\'1D He also used external lawyers and consultants, he said.\par \par \uc2 These big operations take a long time, he explained, and can be distracting for employees. \u8220\'20\'1CI need them to be focused on their daily job\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09Also I believe that for these big transactions it\u8217\'20\'19s the job of the CEO to be directly involved\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09and I don\u8217\'20\'19t need to inspect every well.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 What was critical was to convince the Maersk management to drop their plans for an IPO of the exploration and production unit: \u8220\'20\'1CSo I went to see them myself.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Total followed up its Maersk deal with a very different kind of deal last week, when it paid \u8364\'20\'AC237.5m for a 23 per cent stake in renewable energy company Eren. If the Maersk takeover was an expression of faith in oil and gas, this latest transaction was intended to show that Total is also preparing for the long-term transition towards cleaner energy.\par \par \uc2 Total\u8217\'20\'19s busy month has added to a rising tide of energy deals as confidence gradually returns to the battered sector. This year is on course to see the first growth in oil and gas M&A since the 2014 downturn, with transactions worth $270bn agreed in the first nine months of the year, up 40 per cent on the same point in 2016.\par \par \uc2 This week\u8217\'20\'19s jump in oil prices \u8212\'20\'14 Brent crude hit a two-year high of $59 per barrel \u8212\'20\'14 will only reinforce the sense of animal spirits returning, writes the FT\u8217\'20\'19s Andrew Ward. However, Graham Watson, partner at \uc2 Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer\uc2 , the London-based law firm, says it is the relative stability of prices over the past year, rather than the partial recovery, that has been the most important catalyst for deals.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COil has been in a range between $40 and $60,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CBuyers are confident it is not going down to $25 and sellers are confident it is not going back to $100. Reducing that delta between the two has been key to reaching agreement on valuations.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Tough times for Chinese M&A\par \par \uc2 For Chinese investors cross-border M&A is becoming nearly impossible. At home, regulators are telling them that they can\u8217\'20\'19t park their money abroad. In Europe, the \uc2 EU\uc2  is\u160\'00\'A0working to\u160\'00\'A0erect new barriers to entry. And in the US,\u160\'00\'A0the Trump\u160\'00\'A0administration is clamping down on inbound Chinese deals.\par \par \uc2 This week, Chinese investors seeking to buy a stake in a European mapping company were told to \u8220\'20\'1Capply directly\u8221\'20\'1D to the US president after their \u8364\'20\'AC241m offer failed to win regulatory approval, according to one of the bidders, reports Yuan Yang in Beijing.\par \par \uc2 NavInfo, a Beijing-based mapping provider for tech giant Tencent, agreed last year to\u160\'00\'A0buy a 10 per cent stake in Amsterdam-headquartered Here. The deal to buy a stake in Here, which is\u160\'00\'A0co-owned by German carmakers \uc2 Audi\uc2 , \uc2 BMW\uc2  and\u160\'00\'A0Daimler\u160\'00\'A0and US chipmaker\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Intel\uc2 , was blocked in Europe and regulators told the Chinese investors to try their luck in America. They are unlikely to have much of it.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Committee on Foreign Investment in the US\uc2  (\uc2 Cfius\uc2 ), which has the power to block deals over national security concerns, has been very aggressive of late in crushing Chinese deals. This isn\u8217\'20\'19t just a Trump thing. Former president \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  had also bolstered the scrutiny of deals coming out of China.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The number of transactions referred to \uc2 Cfius\uc2  is expected to hit a record high this year, beating the 2016 high of approximately 18 cases (exact data only comes out more than a year later). Nearly half of these cases are likely to be Chinese.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Bloomberg BNA has interviewed Mario Mancuso, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, and Luci Hague, an associate in \uc2 Kirkland\u8217\'20\'19s\uc2  international trade and national security practice, on essential tips on how to deal with \uc2 Cfius\uc2  reviews.
