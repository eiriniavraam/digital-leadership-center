SHANGHAI Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is leading a $600 million funding round in SenseTime Group Ltd., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/saving-face-investment-in-recognition-technology-heats-up-in-china-1499763603" using facial recognition for law enforcement and commercial applications.

The funding values Beijing-based SenseTime at more than $4.5 billion, according to a person familiar with the company. It also underscores Alibaba's move into businesses that use artificial intelligence, the technology that underpins facial recognition.

Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group has developed a mobile-payment system based on facial recognition, and Alibaba is also using AI to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-giants-have-a-second-job-helping-the-government-see-everything-1512056284" where technology is used to dispatch police, speed traffic flow and regulate other public services.

Smart cities and cloud computing are likely areas of cooperation with Alibaba, SenseTime Chief Executive Xu Li said in an interview.

"They have strong infrastructure capabilities to build a cloud and deliver fundamental resources, while we are good at building computer vision and related infrastructure," Mr. Xu said. "The capabilities between us complement each other quite well."

Alibaba's Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said in a written statement that his company was impressed with SenseTime's technology that allows computers to recognize images, as well as its development of deep-learning technology, in which software mimics the way neurons in the brain process information.

Alibaba's share in the $600 million Series C funding round wasn't disclosed. Other investors include Singapore state investment company Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. and Chinese electronics retailer Suning.com Co.

Founded in 2014, SenseTime is among a handful of Chinese AI startups that got their start selling facial-recognition systems to local police agencies. With a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/twelve-days-in-xinjiang-how-chinas-surveillance-state-overwhelms-daily-life-1513700355", China is using facial recognition to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-police-go-robocop-with-facial-recognition-glasses-1518004353" as well as to influence behavior, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-all-seeing-surveillance-state-feared-in-the-west-is-a-reality-in-china-1498493020".

The technology also has commercial applications, with some companies now using it instead of badges to grant employees access to their workplaces. Mr. Xu said SenseTime would use the new funding to focus on expanding the technology's commercial applications and AI capabilities.

SenseTime is also developing algorithms for autonomous driving, as a partner with Honda Motor Co., and is working with Shanghai's government to use AI to ease traffic congestion.

French private-equity firm Idinvest Partners has held a  ¬180 million ($221.7 million) first close on its third digital fund, which will invest in technology companies across Europe.

The fund which is over halfway to its  ¬300 million target is already the largest Idinvest has raised for this strategy, surpassing the  ¬154 million it gathered for its predecessor, according to a statement released by the firm.

The fund will target deals for high growth technology companies spanning the software, insurance, health and artificial intelligence sectors and is close to sealing its first two investments, the statement added.

Idinvest's venture-capital team, which will be responsible for investing the digital fund, deployed  ¬190 million across 21 companies in 2017.

Companies Idinvest has backed include music streaming site Deezer and online fashion shop Vestiare Collective.

The close comes months after Idinvest announced it had sold a 70% stake in itself to French rival Eurazeo SA for  ¬230 million.

Eurazeo will pledge around  ¬375 million to Idinvest's funds this year, Idinvest Managing Partner Christophe Bavire said in an interview with Private Equity News in February. Idinvest's strategies span venture, buyout, private debt, secondaries and asset finance.

The Sequoia Fund has taken a stake in Facebook in the wake ofa data scandal that has rocked the company s share price.

Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, the manager of the mutual fund, said in a note to clients that it bought a small stake in Facebook at the end of the first quarter following the break out of a data sharing controversy at the company in mid-March.

 Though Facebook has unquestionably committed sins for which it must now atone, we believe it remains a far more competitively advantaged, economically attractive and faster-growing enterprise than the average American business,  according to the note.

Facebook said last week that 87m users may have had their information  improperly shared  with Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that worked for Donald Trump s presidential campaign. The majority of affected users were in the US, but more than 1m were in the UK.

The scandal sent Facebook s share price tumbling by 17 per cent over a two-week period. The company s shares closed at $157.2 on Friday.

At the end of March Sequoia had holdings in Alphabet, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and MasterCard, among many other large US companies.

HSBC enlists AI to spot money laundering and terrorist funds

Banks

HSBC is bringing in robots to help it spot money laundering, fraud and terrorist funding, as the latest bank to harness artificial intelligence to tackle financial crime more quickly and cheaply than with armies of compliance staff.

Europe's biggest bank plans to integrate the AI software of Quantexa, a UK-based start-up, to screen the data it holds on customers and their transactions against publicly available data, in the hunt for suspicious activity.

Stung by multibillion-dollar fines in the past decade for failing to stop illegal finance flowing through their accounts, many large banks are partnering with AI specialists as part of efforts to clean up their act. Using AI to sift through vast amounts of data also offers the opportunity to save money. Banks spend 5bn a year on combating financial crime in the UK alone, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

The move comes just months after HSBC froze an account connected to an alleged $500m fraud by the son of Angola's former president, a development the bank says is a sign its tougher compliance systems are working.

Jennifer Calvery, the bank's global head of financial crime threat mitigation, said in a recent video on Quantexa's website that the bank believed in "harnessing technology and data ... to get to a place in the future where we understand and can see criminal behaviour in as near real time as possible".

HSBC has invested billions of pounds to improve its compliance controls after a $1.9bn settlement in 2012 to avoid criminal charges for allegedly laundering at least $881m for Mexican drug barons and breaching US sanctions on countries including Iran and Sudan.

As part of its clean-up efforts, the bank sold more than 100 businesses and pulled out of more than 20 countries under Stuart Gulliver, its chief executive from 2011 until this year. John Flint, his successor, is considering pulling out of some of the other 67 countries it still operates in, such as Bermuda.

Quantexa was founded in 2016. Its software scans data on transactions from sources, such as phone numbers, addresses, company directors and news reports, to look for suspicious connections.

Vishal Marria, founder and chief executive of Quantexa, said: "It is about understanding the flows of money: we build that picture for every customer in real time." The company last year raised $3.3m in funding from HSBC and Albion Ventures. HSBC has also teamed up with Ayasdi, an AI specialist, to automate parts of its anti-money laundering investigations.

Regulators are monitoring banks' use of AI to spot financial crime. Rob Gruppetta, head of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's financial crime department, said in a recent speech: "Any bank hoping for a black box in the corner that will sniff out the launderers will be disappointed, but the technology has the capability to better achieve what we all want: keeping finance clean."

Cooper's Take: TPG and the Internet of Things; TPG's recently announced deal to acquire Wind River Systems marks the firm's first buyout in the IoT sector

Are buyout firms ready to dive deeper into the Internet of Things?

Megabuyout firm TPG says yes.

The Internet of Things, or IoT, a technology category characterized by devices that are connected to the internet, has long been an investment darling among venture capitalists. Private-equity firms however, haven't historically been as active in backing such companies.

While the $13 billion private-equity investors put into the sector in the U.S. last year is greater than the $3 billion deployed by venture capitalists, the number of venture deals completed in the space in 2017 far exceeded the number of private-equity transactions, according to figures from PitchBook Data Inc. IoT companies closed on 40 private-equity investments last year compared with 321 venture deals in the same period.

"It's been hard to find things of scale in IoT. There are dozens and dozens of small startups in [artificial intelligence] or IoT," said Nehal Raj, a partner at TPG who focuses on the firm's technology investments across its private-equity funds.

However, private-equity investors like TPG are continuing to make inroads in the space.

For its part, TPG recently "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tpg-to-acquire-wind-river-systems-from-intel-1522782216?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1"Wind River Systems Inc. from Intel Corp. in its first IoT deal from one of its flagship buyout funds. The firm has backed at least one such company using growth capital, investing in software platform C3 IoT.

Wind River provides technology and services that help companies develop connected computing systems. Mr. Raj said he sees potential for further growth beyond the 2 billion devices that currently use the company's technology. Autonomous vehicles, he said, could offer one avenue for expansion.

TPG is interested in IoT because of the large amount of data that enterprises produce, and the ways in which that data can be analyzed. Mr. Raj also pointed to opportunities stemming from the fact that it is both "easy and cheap" to place sensors that interact with software on devices.

Whether other large buyout firms share TPG's enthusiasm for the IoT sector remains to be seen. It is still early days for IoT, and with a shifting technology landscape that often renders previous advancements obsolete, some firms aren't willing to invest in the space.

However, if the concept continues to find its way into the technology that consumers, companies and even cities use, firms currently making bets within the space could one day find themselves reaping great rewards.

Banking & Finance: At JPMorgan, an Upbeat Outlook --- CEO Dimon offers up encouraging prospects for bank's growth in letter to shareholders

By Emily Glazer

JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief James Dimon shared an optimistic view of the bank's growth prospects in his annual shareholder letter.

Mr. Dimon, chairman and chief executive of the largest U.S. bank by assets, focused on potential boosts in JPMorgan's businesses ranging from fixed-income trading to new-country expansion to opportunities in wealth management.

That represents a more positive tone than letters in recent years that emphasized U.S. regulatory shortcomings, a defense of the bank's size and the threat of Silicon Valley upstarts.

Mr. Dimon spent a good chunk of his 47-page letter, released Thursday, focused on things that could be better and things that worry him, from "poor public policy" to cybersecurity gaps, and the risks that come from interest-rate policy changes and proliferation of exchange-traded funds.

Still, Mr. Dimon cast a generally optimistic message about the bank's outlook, as he stressed that recent U.S. tax changes and a "more constructive regulatory environment" should allow the bank to expand into new markets, broaden businesses and support employees. He reiterated that the bank should be able to keep its return on tangible equity at about 17%, a relatively high level compared with recent postcrisis years.

Mr. Dimon also reiterated his position on changing public policy, including overhauls in education, infrastructure and immigration.

Most notably, he shed light on the bank's health-care initiative with Amazon.com Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. that was announced in January and has been largely kept under wraps.

Mr. Dimon said that while the U.S. has "some of the best healthcare in the world" it has some of the worst "outcomes and costs."

He added: "We need to form a bipartisan group of experts whose direct charge is to fix our healthcare system."

Mr. Dimon said the health-care initiative among the three industry giants will start small and use big data, virtual technology and other methods to address areas needing improvement.

Those include aligning incentives; studying the amount spent on administration and fraud; empowering employees to own their health-care data; and studying the use of specialized medicine and pharmaceuticals.

While Mr. Dimon didn't go into detail on most geopolitical issues, he did write that the bank will "be prepared for Brexit" even though "it's complex and hard to figure out."

Mr. Dimon wrote that the bank will move 300 to 400 jobs around Europe in the short term and change some of its legal entities to conduct business the day after Brexit.

Mr. Dimon also wrote of growth opportunities in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading as capital markets expand.

He also said the bank's high-net-worth and affluent wealth-management businesses should be able to double their respective market shares over the next 10 years.

One risk he is watching for is the possibility that the reversal of quantitative easing by the world's central banks may be different from what people expect.

"We have to deal with the possibility that at one point, the Federal Reserve and other central banks may have to take more drastic action than they currently anticipate -- reacting to the markets, not guiding the markets," he wrote. "A simple scenario under which this could happen is if inflation and wages grow more than people expect."

---

From Fed to Brexit,

According to Dimon

Here is where James Dimon stands on some top issues. (The first six quotes are from his annual shareholder letter. The last one is from a Yahoo Finance interview Thursday.)

Fed and rates: "Many people underestimate the possibility of higher inflation and wages, which means they might be underestimating the chance that the Federal Reserve may have to raise rates faster than we all think."

JPMorgan's growth prospects: "We have good market share in most businesses, but we see organic growth opportunities almost everywhere."

Cybersecurity: "I cannot overemphasize the importance of cybersecurity in America. . . . It is an arms race, and we need to do whatever we can to protect the United States."

Brexit: "It's complex and hard to figure out, and the long-term impact to the United Kingdom is still uncertain."

U.S. health-care system: "We need to form a bipartisan group of experts whose direct charge is to fix our healthcare system. . . . The United States has some of the best healthcare in the world, including our doctors, nurses, hospitals and clinical research. However, we also have some of the worst -- in terms of some outcomes and costs."

Regulatory environment: "Regulators now have begun to simplify, coordinate and reduce overlapping regulations."

Trump, taxes and trade: "Tax reform and regulatory reform are good for the economy and the markets. Trade can go either way depending on how that's worked out."

Opening Quote: Hammerson suggests Klpierre shut up shop

Hammerson, the shopping mall owner, seems to believe in the proverb  more haste less speed . Just not in that exact order. It was somewhat less than speedy in telling shareholders about a proposed offer from mall rival Klpierre. But it has shown great haste in arranging a first quarter trading update amid its own bid for rival Intu.

In fact, Hammerson took 11 days to tell investors of last month s takeover proposal from Klpierre at 615p a share - a premium of 40 per cent to its undisturbed share price, which it had already rejected. But it appears to have given only a few days  notice of today s suddenly-arranged first quarter update - an announcement it has never before felt a need to make.

Could it be that Hammerson now feels a need to tell shareholders a bit more about its reasons for pressing on with the Intu deal and ignoring Klpierre? Because it knows Klpierre has wasted no time in telling those same shareholders why it shouldn t?

Judging by this morning s update, yes and no.

Hammerson has made almost no explicit reference to either its Intu deal or the Klpierre approach - they are mentioned only three times - but it has gone out of its way to emphasise the strength and value of its own business.

In particular, without mentioning Klpierre, it has highlighted the difference between the French group s possible 615p offer and its own latest net asset per value per share, of 790p at 31 March 2018 - a 1.8 per cent increase in that quarter alone.

Hammerson has also noted  strong leasing momentum  across UK, France and Ireland following record activity in 2017. Some 7m of group leases were signed in the period, significantly up on Q1 2017, despite widely reported problems at retailers such as Toys R Us and New Look. Growth in rental values was achieved across all segments of the portfolio.

Net debt of 3.4bn also meant the loan to value ratio fell by 100 basis points to 35 per cent.

And shareholders were reassured that Hammerson remains on track to deliver 500m of property disposals this year, allowing it to recycle capital. It had completed 92m of those disposals in the quarter.

So the ball is now very much in Klpierre s (sixth floor food) court. Hammerson suggests it should either go shopping - or shut up shop. Pointedly, the UK group said:

 While Klpierre's position remains unclear, the board of Hammerson does not intend to finalise shareholder documents in relation to the proposed acquisition of intu. The  put up or shut up  deadline for Klpierre is 16 April 2018. 

Klepierre, however, suggests its offer is about diversification and asset quality. It argues that if the Hammerson-Intu deal is allowed to go ahead, then the overall Hammerson property portfolio becomes lower quality, and goes from 57 per cent UK based to 75 per cent. That, it suggests makes a route back to a 615p share price much more difficult, irrespective of portfolio net asset value.

Fund managers were also given a tacit rebuke this morning, by the regulator - in particular those managers who simply mimic stock market indices, and make money when customers buy and sell their funds.

In publishing the next steps it intends to take to improve competition in the UK asset management industry, the Financial Conduct Authority has detailed a number of new proposals, including

* Ensuring that managers express their fund objectives more clearly, and in a more useful way, to investors;

* Requiring managers to make it clearer when their funds are  benchmark-constrained , or limited in how far their holdings can differ from the weightings of a benchmark index;

* Making managers disclose the benchmarks that they are measuring themselves against, more consistently and with better explanations;

* Imposing technical changes to improve fairness around the way in which fund managers  profit from investors buying and selling their funds ;

* Demanding that managers facilitate the movement of investors into cheaper share classes.

All of these proposals follow the FCA s asset management market study, which it reported on in June 2017.

Other proposed steps include:

* Requiring fund managers to make an annual assessment of value, as part of their duty to act in the best interests of the investors in their funds

* Having managers to appoint a minimum of two independent directors to their boards.

And, finally, software group Fidessa has disclosed more to its investors: it has revealed the identities of two mystery potential bidders who gatecrashed its takeover by Swiss group Temenos, which had been due to be signed-off by shareholders today. They are: trading software provider Ion Trading and US-based financial services technology group SS&C.

Fidessa, which provides trading and investment management systems, analytics and market data, said the 37.50 plus dividend per share potential offer it revealed earlier in the week had come from Ion Trading.

Today s Lombard column focuses on C&C s acquisition of Conviviality s wholesale drinks business for 1:

Six months ago, drinks group C&C thought it had devised a clever deal: after Molson Coors cut the strength of its Carling lager for tax reasons, C&C offered to exchange cans of the insipid diuretic for cans of its own slightly less watery Tennents. But, to anyone familiar with these  cooking lagers , it was one of those transactions where it s hard to tell who ends up worse off. Even Glaswegians might admit the only canny thing about it was the aluminium. It was, as propositions go, arguably lose-lose.

On Wednesday, however, C&C came up with a deal that looks undeniably win-win.

Upstart MoviePass to Join With Cinema Service Moviefone; Majority owner of MoviePass is to buy the longstanding cinema service from Verizon unit Oath

The "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/19/moviepass-wants-its-many-skeptics-to-know-it-has-a-plan/" is joining with one of the nation's oldest cinema services, Moviefone.

Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc., majority owner of MoviePass, has agreed to buy Moviefone from its owner, Verizon Communications Inc.'s digital division Oath, the companies said Thursday.

To buy Moviefone, Helios is paying Oath $1 million in cash and 2.55 million shares, worth $7.45 million at their Thursday midday price of $2.92, according to a regulatory filing. In addition, Helios agreed to issue warrants for the purchase of up to 2.55 million of its shares at an exercise price of $5.50 each, exercisable over five years.

The deal marks Helios's first acquisition meant to complement MoviePass since buying control of it last August. MoviePass subsequently launched a new plan letting subscribers see one film a day for $9.95 a month, which proved popular among consumers but divisive in the entertainment industry.

Moviefone, which the companies said has more than 6 million unique monthly visitors, will serve as a platform to recruit subscribers for MoviePass and expand its advertising business, Helios Chief Executive Ted Farnsworth said.

MoviePass has more than 2 million subscribers and expects to have more than 5 million by the end of the year, he said. Because it pays the full price of tickets for movies its subscribers attend, MoviePass loses money on people who go to the cinema multiple times a month or in the case of expensive markets, even once.

Mr. Farnsworth said only 12% of MoviePass subscribers are "heavy users" and that it would be profitable excluding that segment.

But since those heavy users are unlikely to leave, MoviePass seeks to make money other ways, including selling advertisements to studios that want to reach its user base. MoviePass will also offer the Moviefone site as part of its ad packages, said Mr. Farnsworth.

Oath will continue to sell the rest of Moviefone's ad inventory, the companies said.

Some in the film industry, including the world's largest cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/moviepass-says-success-will-convince-theater-industry-to-cooperate-1502909718", saying it trains consumers to undervalue films and that it is financially unsustainable. Mr. Farnsworth said his company is a boon to moviegoing and that it has accounted for 7% of all tickets bought so far this year in the U.S.

He said as MoviePass grows in size, it will be better able to sell ads to studios and negotiate for discounts or a share of concession revenue from theaters.

Founded in 1989 as a telephone service to find film times, Moviefone has evolved into an online guide for entertainment of all types including film, television, and web video

Moviefone is modestly profitable but Mr. Farnsworth said he believes its bottom line will grow by combining it with MoviePass.

PWC Faces Largest-ever Auditor Malpractice Damages Verdict; Even PwC's offer of $306 million would be the largest-ever accounting malpractice final verdict amount

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. could collect the largest damage award ever against a global public accounting firm when a federal judge decides what to award the agency after a verdict against PricewaterhouseCoopers.

The FDIC, acting as receiver for the failed Colonial Bank Group that collapsed in 2009, has asked Judge Barbara Rothstein to award it $625 million in compensation for the net losses it sustained in paying depositors and other creditors of the bank from the federal deposit insurance fund.

Even PwC's offer of $306 million would result in the largest-ever final judgment or jury verdict for accounting malpractice, and the fifth-largest accounting malpractice award ever, according to data compiled by research firm Audit Analytics.

Judge Rothstein is not required to accept either version of the damage estimates.

The potential damage award comes after Rothstein issued a decision at the end of 2017 that PwC had been professionally negligent in not detecting the criminal fraud that led to the failure of Colonial Bank Group in 2009.

An FDIC spokesman declined to comment on pending litigation.

A PwC statement said: "The FDIC bears the burden of proof on its inflated damages claim. The FDIC should not be able to recover damages based on real loans that had nothing to do with the fraud."

Judge Rothstein issued a decision on Dec. 28 that gave the FDIC a win on one of three claims it brought against PwC after a full bench trial that ran for several weeks in Alabama and Washington, D.C.

Taylor Bean & Whitaker and Colonial Bank collapsed in 2009, after federal regulators, not the auditors, found a $3 billion fraud involving fake mortgage assets. In 2012, the trustee of the Taylor Bean & Whitaker Bankruptcy Plan sued both TBW's auditor, Deloitte LLP, and Colonial's auditor, PwC, for negligence, seeking $7 billion in damages from Deloitte and $5.5 billion in damages from PwC.

In 2013, just weeks before starting a trial, Deloitte agreed to settle; the parties mutually agreed not to disclose the amount. On August 16, 2016, three weeks into a jury trial for the TBW Trustee's claims, PwC stopped the proceedings by agreeing to settle. Again, the amount was not disclosed.

This time the public will find out how much PwC has to pay for allegedly not detecting the fraud at Colonial Bank that led to its failure. That's because federal law prohibits the FDIC from entering into a confidential settlement.

Judge Rothstein held a three-day hearing on the Colonial Bank damages in March and is expected to render a decision in the next month on how much the FDIC, as receiver of failed Colonial Bank, can collect from PwC.

The $319 million difference in the two damage experts' estimates is the result of a difference in opinion between the two parties in whether several hundred millions of dollars of "junk" loans dumped into Colonial Bank's warehouse lending facility were also part of the fraud between the bank and TBW.

According to a court filing made by PwC after the damages hearing, there was no "junk" loan fraud, given that every warehouse lines lender experienced significant losses from loans it could not sell or securitize because of insufficient or missing documentation and other violations of representations and warranties made by mortgage originators during the financial crisis.

The FDIC said in its court filing after the damages hearing that every other one of TBW's warehouse lender except Colonial Bank "put back," that is returned for full, faulty loans it could not sell or securitize. Only Colonial Bank allowed TBW's loans to age on its books and lose value over time, therefore increasing the eventual loss to the bank and now the FDIC.

The FDIC presented evidence at the hearing that the two Colonial executives who decided to keep the loans on the books were the ones who later pleaded guilty for their part in the fraud. If they had sent the bad loans back to TBW, the fraud would have been stopped earlier. The FDIC alleged that PwC didn't detect this part of the fraud in addition to missing the other parts of the fraud the accounting firm does agree the FDIC should be now compensated for.

On April 4, the FDIC also settled its claims of professional malpractice and breach of contract against Crowe Horwath LLP, another public accounting firm that acted as Colonial Bank's internal audit services consultant

That settlement amount will also be made public and could impact the amount PwC will have to pay to make the FDIC whole for its losses.

Transcript: Fed's Harker Answers Reporters' Questions in New York; Philadelphia Fed leader talks about the labor market and how regional Fed presidents get hired

Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker sat down with reporters in New York on Thursday, March 29, 2018, after delivering a speech on the economy and state of business dynamism. He discussed the yield curve, the labor market and how regional Fed presidents get hired, among other topics. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for clarity and length.

Q: Asking about the yield curve, the yield curve's been flattening again after it had started steepening back out. Last time we were heading into (a flat) yield curve, there was a lot of worries about recessions coming up. So now that we're flattening again &is there a message that we need to be paying attention to there?

PATRICK T. HARKER: I always look through the short-term fluctuations. And I think if you just look at what will transpire over the long run, with the increased federal debt issuance and the roll off of the balance sheet, that will have an effect, of course, on steepening the curve. So, if that doesn't occur in the way I anticipate, then I'd be willing to slow the pace of (interest rate) increases. But right now, I don't anticipate that. So I'm still going for three this year &If it's counter to what we would normally expect given everything we know then, yeah, I think we have to revisit that &We shouldn't be looking any one week or even month, but sort of the longer term.

Q: So I guess, as you guys look at the labor market right now, we're obviously seeing some increase in prime-age participation, but we haven't seen a lot of wage pressure. But you guys continue to sort of say that we're sort of in the vicinity of full employment. What makes you think  

MR. HARKER: Or below.

Q: What makes you think that we've hit that level? And do you ever question whether it's actually possible that we're nowhere near   (inaudible)?

MR. HARKER: Oh, I question every one of my assumptions every day. (Laughs.) Right? I think that's   you have to, just to make sure that you really know what's going on and what you don't know. I think it's important for us to know what we know and what we don't know. And here's a good example of where we have a view   I mean, I think the profession does, every individual does on the committee and elsewhere   on what we think the natural rate of unemployment is, the (non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment). It could be lower than we   I mean, it could be lower.

So what are you looking for? You're looking for signs to when you hit it. You don't know what it is, but you'll know it when you see it. And you'll see it in wage pressure. You'll see it increase   in other measures, not just wages &You can start to see a whole host of measures. (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) data, time to fill positions, a variety of things that say the market's getting tighter and tighter and tighter. So that's what I'm looking at, again, not just wages, but a variety of measures.

And, again, it could be, and there's a hypothesis there, that says given the compositional shift of the labor force, that is, more college educated and less, you know, that that may have some effect. I'm a little skeptical about that, but it is a plausible hypothesis, that college educated have lower unemployment than noncollege educated. And if we make that shift, then we're going to see the natural rate come down. Again, it's possible. But we'll only know that in retrospect, honestly. We can't know that head of time.

Q: One of my two unconventional questions. Number one, there's been an extraordinary amount of public scrutiny and political criticism of the New York Fed's selection of the bank president. Some of that the concerns go back to the selection of you at Philadelphia three years ago. Is there validity to the criticism surrounding opacity and a lack of diversity? And is there an argument for more congressional oversight to this process?

MR. HARKER: Yeah. So let me start with the   I'll come back to the diversity point. But on the opacity issue, that's a complicated issue. I'll use one example from my previous job. So many states have passed sunshine laws saying university presidential selections have to be open. There are many cases   and you can look them up   where the trustees have presented one candidate for the open process. In other words, it was a sham.

But the reason for that is & the candidates you want often have big jobs, right? And if they have to go public on this, they're done in that job, right? I mean, an extreme example just happened. I forget which university it was. Akron. University of Akron. The guy entered the University of Florida search. He's now no longer the president of the University of Akron, right? (Laughs.) So because just entering the search in a public way   so.

OK, that's a university setting. Well, similar things happen to the kind of people we're trying to recruit, I mean, honestly. So there are absolute advantages to more transparency in the process. And I think we need to work on better ways of doing that, no question. At the same time, we do have to worry that will preclude a set of very highly accomplished and qualified candidates from even entering the pool. And that's human nature. And I don't think you're going to be able to change that.

And that relates to the diversity front. I think there's two things we need to do on the diversity front. One is, absolutely increase the pool of qualified people. And, again, this is where I worry about the opacity piece, because in some cases the kind of people you're going after are highly accomplished in their role, highly sought after. And they're not going to   they're not going to take that risk. And that's true of diverse candidates as well as nondiverse candidates.

Second issue is we   and I think we are making this movement   we need to do a better job of increasing the pipeline at the, not just at junior level, but all the way up the ranks. The senior vice president   we need to start grooming more people inside, a more diverse labor pool. And I think we're working on it. We have a new program under way where we're taking some people, targeting some people who we see across the system as high potential individuals, diverse high potential individuals, and giving them some experiences and more exposure, not just in the bank but across the system. And as a result, also giving them a sense that they can   they can do more than what they're currently doing.

So I think we need, if we have this problem, and I do believe we have this problem, it's on us to try to solve it. We're not going to solve it by trying to steal people from the outside. We got to do a better job inside.

Q: So would congressional oversight help? More congressional oversight?

MR. HARKER: Again, what I just said, I don't see how it would. I mean, what would congressional oversight   how would it move any of those two needles I just described?

Q: Well, (Sen.) Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) was saying, you know, maybe a public hearing with some of the   maybe the shortlist of contenders, or the nominee.

MR. HARKER: So if that's the case, I worry about then the independence of the Fed. And would you do that for all 12 presidents? And you would supersede the role of the directors of the banks and the board of governors? And I think while it has some appeal, and I understand the appeal, there are unintended consequences. And some of that would be a diminution of the independence   or, at least perception   whether it's in reality or perceived   independence of the Federal Reserve system. And I think that is a significant problem.

Q: Yeah. This is   this is back and continuing on with the question about the tightening of the yield spreads. You know, there's been a lot of talk about the (London interbank offered rate   overnight indexed swap) spread opening. And some of the people I've spoken to talk about that   some of it as being the pressure upward on the Libor is coming out of the huge influx from Treasury to meet   because of funding needs, government funding needs.

MR. HARKER: Yeah, that's possible.

Q: And so my question to you would be, is the Fed taking that into account? Are they watching it? I've even seen somebody saying it could almost do the tightening role for the Fed.

MR. HARKER: So the old mantra of monetary policy is let the markets do the work. (Laughter.) And so if we let the markets do the job, then our job is much easier. So that   in fact, that is a good thing. But absolutely   I can't speak for the Fed, I can just speak for myself   I'm watching this very carefully, yes &But also you think about what's happening with the tapering of accommodation in the (European Central Bank) and elsewhere. That's also changing. There's a lot of dynamics. It's no one thing that are changing the shape of the yield curve.

Q: A follow-up question on diversity issues. As you said, you know, promoting diversity is an important thing. I mean, it definitely needs to happen. Do you think that if there were more diversity among the leadership ranks or within, you know, the staff, would that lead to significantly different outcomes for policy? I think sometimes when people talk about diversity they do expect the Fed will be doing something differently because of that. Do you think that's right?

MR. HARKER: I think in this case it's not diversity   ethnic diversity or racial diversity that will make a difference; it's diversity of thinking and, as we were talking about earlier in this session, diversity of life experiences. I mean, we're all creatures of our academic training. We're all creatures of the life path that we've taken. And so having more diversity, all-inclusive, that avoids the kind of groupthink that I believe is dangerous.

So, again, you can have people who come from diverse ethnic backgrounds but all went to the same schools, all of them studied the same thing, all did the same job, and is that really diversity, I mean? I mean, and so I think there's a need for diversity in all forms. But typically, when you have people coming from different backgrounds   ethnic backgrounds   they've had different life experiences, and they will bring that to the table. And I think that's a really good thing.

Q: But will it affect how policy gets made?

MR. HARKER: It could. Again, I think   just let's take a slice of diversity that came up in this session, age. We don't talk about that much. We talk about race and gender. But the experience of people who lived through high-inflation periods is very different than the people who have never experienced high inflation in their life. I remember the WIN buttons, "Whip Inflation Now," with (President) Gerald Ford, right? That has an effect on the way I think, right, as opposed to, say, a millennial that there's never been any concept of high inflation. So sure, I mean, even there you need diversity of   because no one person's experience is going to be the harbinger of what's going to happen in the future. It's probably some combination.

Q: So, on the diversity point, I think one of the main complaints about this process and also some of the other processes, including the Richmond one, is that you guys say that you're working on diversity, you say that we should trust you that you're working on diversity and it ends up being a nondiverse outcome, but there's no visibility of the process in between, really. Like, if   I get that you guys don't want to be sharing candidate lists for competitive reasons for the candidates. Is there some other way or some other   any other strategy under discussion for making the process more accountable so that people really know that diversity was something that you guys tried   (inaudible)?

MR. HARKER: So, again, I think inside we have, obviously, more control of the kind of things we can put in place. I also think, to avoid groupthink, we can do a better job of recruiting people from outside, not just at the presidential level but senior vice president level and VP level. In Philadelphia we recruited two women of color at the senior vice president level that have, you know   and another woman that came a few years ago   have tremendous potential. So these are the kind of people   so we can bring talent from outside and then   and then cultivate that.

When it comes to a more diverse pool for the roles of president and first vice president   or let's just focus on president for the moment, because first vice president is a little different because you do need some system experience generally to do that job effectively. There I think we really need to broaden the way   the kind of skillsets we think about. We have a   you know, a strong bias, an understandable bias, for economists. I mean, that's who we are. But there are certain academic professions and certain other professions where there's more diversity than, say, within the ranks of academic economists that we might want to tap into to look for a more diverse pool of candidates. You know, pick a field   political science, I don't know what the field is   but there's probably more diversity than   and the economics profession itself knows it's got a problem and they've been trying to   so, as opposed to just waiting for that to resolve itself, let's look for a more diverse  

Q: And that's for the presidents?

MR. HARKER: Yeah, I'm just focusing for the presidents level.

Q: Yeah. Do you think there's also a bias toward sort of Fed insiders when it comes to the presidents?

MR. HARKER: Hasn't been lately, I would say. I mean   I mean, me, (Atlanta Fed President) Raphael (Bostic). I mean, Raphael had once been, you know, hanging around the halls. But no, I think the last several were not insiders, at least coming from the inside directly.

Q: Switching topics again: 2016, a cyberhack of the Bangladesh (central bank's) account to the New York Fed. Can I ask you about this? Your bank does a lot of work on payments. You have a personal interest in the payments infrastructure there. You know, $81 million was stolen. They only recovered a portion of that. Bangladesh is looking to potentially sue the Philippine banks through which the money went. Do you think the Fed   I mean, the account was here. It was in the Fed system &Do you think the Fed has a duty to join any kind of suit that might come?

MR. HARKER: I don't know enough to comment.

Q: Do you think the Fed can do more to, you know, help Bangladesh to recover these funds or find the culprits?

MR. HARKER: Again, I'm just not up to speed enough on that particular instance to know.

Q: I've been wanting to ask you a quick question about the idea for machine learning. Because, of course, when you talk about the quant funds, I immediately think back to the financial crisis and how they   all the models weren't set for when everything moved in the same direction. And I'm just wondering  &how you think that machine learning can address some of those questions? Because you think that perhaps it can.

MR. HARKER: Well, again, what   at a very fundamental level, what does machine learning do? It's pattern recognition, right? So it's looking for patterns.

Q: Arguably, so were those quant funds that, you know, crashed and burned. (Laughs.)

MR. HARKER: The problem is, then   the problem, like anything, you can have groupthink with human beings and you can have groupthink with algorithms where everybody's running the same algorithm. (Laughs.) It's not any different than groupthink with human beings.

So I worry   yeah, sure. I think that you have to have a mix of models and approaches to try to   or else you are going to get highly-correlated behavior, which is dangerous.

Manufacturing Industry Has Strongest Jobs Increase in Three Years; Firms across the U.S. added 241,000 workers last month, according to ADP and Moody's Analytics

Hiring at private U.S. employers grew more than expected in March, according to a report, as the manufacturing industry showed the strongest increase in more than three years.

Firms across the country added 241,000 workers in March, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the addition of 200,000 jobs.

"The job market is rip-roaring," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "The tight labor market continues to tighten."

Midsized businesses added nearly half of all jobs in the month. The job growth came from across industries, with construction, professional business services and trade, transportation and utilities leading the way.

The February figure was revised up to 246,000 from 235,000.

The ADP report is based on private-payroll data in addition to government data.

The ADP report comes ahead of the monthly jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. Economists expect nonfarm jobs to rise by 178,000 for March, compared with 313,000 the prior month.

Government Sends New Message With ICO Enforcement Case

Criminal-fraud charges "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-charges-startup-co-founders-with-fraudulent-initial-coin-offering-1522715492" against the founders of Centra Tech Inc. show that prosecutors and regulators are finally taking action against some of the most hyped initial coin offerings.

Suffice it to say the case sends a new message to promoters of ICOs that evade or defy the law. Lying to investors won't just "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hot-cryptocoin-market-chilled-by-sec-scrutiny-1521557569", a regulatory agency that enforces the civil securities laws it may also attract the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. attorneys, who can seek prison time for fraud.

Centra raised over $32 million from investors last year, claiming it had deals with Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. that would allow users to spend their cryptocurrencies using credit or debit cards. Investors who handed their cash or bitcoin to Centra got a token that traded for about 30 cents on various virtual-currency exchanges before Centra's founders were arrested Sunday. The SEC says Centra didn't have any partnerships with Visa or Mastercard.

Centra also allegedly made up a fake chief executive, Michael Edwards, saying he was a Harvard M.B.A. who had worked at Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. The SEC says the executive was a fabrication, including the LinkedIn profile that described his Wall Street credentials.

The case is also one of the first to involve a celebrity promoter. Centra's 26-year-old and 31-year-old founders had little experience with trading or cryptocurrencies, but they stoked excitement for their token sale by enlisting celebrities such as Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled to tout it. Mr. Mayweather tweeted in September 2017: "Centra's (CTR) ICO starts in a few hours. Get yours before they sell out, I got mine."

The SEC's complaint against Centra's founders says celebrities were paid to plug the token sale, which could violate laws that require stock promoters to disclose their compensation. The complaint doesn't mention any celebs by name, but includes a reference to the language of Mr. Mayweather's tweet. A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather didn't respond Tuesday to an email seeking comment.

The SEC has warned investors they shouldn't rely on celebrity endorsements as a sign of legitimacy. Suing famous "stock touts" involved in shady ICOs would send yet another new message that the SEC intends to hold all key participants accountable.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Rules for Lending to the Poor Under Review

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rules-for-lending-to-the-poor-under-review-1522776120" to revamp lending rules in lower-income communities with a proposal that would make it easier for banks to comply with a decades-old law that has long confounded the industry.

The Treasury Department, in a memo released Tuesday, said the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act hasn't kept pace with the evolving banking sector. The law, which was passed to stop "redlining," a form of lending discrimination, is enforced by a complicated series of regulations. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting, who both dealt with the law as executives at OneWest Bank, now a part of CIT Group Inc., have said altering the rules is a priority.

Under the proposed changes, banks would be held to more objective, numbers-based standards for complying with the law, compared with the current approach where large parts of the exam hinge on regulators' subjective judgments. The changes would also make it easier for banks to meet certain lending requirements and lower penalties for compliance problems.

Longfin Collapse Puts Focus on Lax IPO Rules

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/longfin-collapse-puts-focus-on-lax-ipo-rules-1522788520" post-financial-crisis rules to list in the stock market has lost 85% of its value in six trading days, highlighting the risks for individual investors from a program designed to help small companies go public.

Longfin Corp., a financial-technology company that does nearly all of its business in Singapore, listed its shares on Nasdaq in December. On Monday, the company said it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's rapid rise and epic collapse highlights flaws in how gatekeepers such as the SEC, stock exchanges and index providers are policing the fast-track method used by Longfin to sell shares to the public, regulators and lawyers said.

New York Fed Picks John Williams as President

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-fed-picks-john-williams-as-president-1522773002" said Tuesday that John Williams, who has helmed the San Francisco Fed since 2011, will become its next leader, assuming one of the top leadership positions at the U.S. central bank.

Mr. Williams, a 55-year-old economist whose research has helped shape top Federal Reserve officials' thinking on monetary policy, is set to succeed William Dudley, who will retire June 17. Mr. Williams will start the next day.

WSJ Pro: Fed's Brainard Says Fiscal Stimulus Could Raise Risks of Financial Imbalances

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-brainard-says-fiscal-stimulus-could-raise-risks-of-financial-imbalances-1522787413" said Tuesday the central bank is on the lookout for new asset bubbles in light of recently enacted tax and spending legislation.

Ms. Brainard said pushing through such big stimulus measures in a strong economy could cause financial stability concerns, in remarks delivered at an event held at New York University.

Overall, Ms. Brainard said asset valuations had grown "elevated" but that risks to the broad financial system remained "moderate," in part because investors and households haven't borrowed excessively. New rules on financial institutions imposed since the last financial crisis through the Dodd-Frank Act also have held down risks to the financial system, she said

Goldman's Latest Push: Managing Cash for Big Companies

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldmans-latest-push-managing-cash-for-big-companies-1522778718" plotting a move into commercial banking, hiring a senior JPMorgan Chase & Co. engineer to build a suite of cash management tools, deposit accounts and other products for big companies, according to people familiar with the plans.

Hari Moorthy is joining as a partner from JPMorgan, where he was a managing director working on commercial-banking technology. He will be designing similar tools that Goldman could offer to corporate clients, as well as use to manage its own finances, according to the people.

It is a somewhat unorthodox move for Goldman, which is better known for its advice on mergers and capital raising. The business of helping companies manage and move their cash is generally the province of big commercial banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc., which use giant balance sheets and global footprints to help companies manage their day-to-day finances.

First-Quarter Results Expected to Show Thriving Wall Street Trading Desks

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-unusual-was-the-first-quarter-even-wall-street-trading-desks-are-expected-to-thrive-1522834200?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" for markets in the first quarter, Wall Street's trading desks are poised to report one of their best three-month periods in years.

While no one is expecting a new peak in trading like the ones that occurred in 2009 and shortly before the financial crisis, the trading desks of the biggest U.S. banks are expected report revenue as much as 5% higher than a year ago, say analysts at Credit Suisse. Analysts at Jefferies are a bit more optimistic, saying that trading results, which sometimes make or break a quarter for some the largest U.S. lenders, could rise in the high single digits.

That would be welcome news to Wall Street and bank investors, especially since the first quarter of 2017 was itself a relatively strong trading period in the wake of the U.S. presidential election. Another boost could put the five biggest U.S. banks in line for possibly their biggest trading quarter since the beginning of 2015.

So Far So Good: Financial Firms Commit to London Despite Brexit Concerns

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/so-far-so-good-financial-firms-commit-to-london-despite-brexit-concerns-1522753201" to exit from the European Union set off alarms in the London office market that tenants and investors would flee the city.

But the market is proving to be surprisingly resilient. Last year, investors purchased  ¬77.1 billion ($95 billion) worth of commercial property in the U.K., up from  ¬63.9 billion in 2016, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Even more reassuring, big financial-services firms have renewed their commitment to the city. In the largest lease of 2017, Deutsche Bank AG took 500,000 square feet at 21 Moorfields in the City of London. This year SMBC Nikko, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., the second-largest bank in Japan by assets, took 161,000 square feet at 100 Liverpool Street.

WSJ Pro: China Tightens Reins on Asset-Management Businesses

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tightens-reins-on-asset-management-businesses-1522809379" that operate illegally online, its latest effort to rein in a $15 trillion industry exposing ordinary investors to the nation's debt risks.

A task force led by the central bank has ordered the shutdown of internet businesses that sell investment products without permission by the end of June, according to a notice reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The notice, dated March 28 and written by the nation's internet finance watchdog, asked regulators in each province to conduct thorough inspections, including on-site visits.

Beijing has been increasing scrutiny of the asset-management sector; last month it approved tighter regulations that seek to rein in risky practices in the industry, especially banks' off-the-books-lending through nonbank financial institutions.

Mind the Gender Pay Gap

Britain is requiring companies with more than 250 employees to report "https://www.wsj.com/graphics/uk-pay-gap/". That includes subsidiaries of global multinationals, even if their headquarters are outside the country. Companies must calculate and disclose median hourly pay for all their U.K.-based employees from a single "snap shot" day, April 5, 2017.

So far, of the 8,330 companies that have reported, most have said median hourly pay for women was less than median hourly pay for men. Half of the companies reported that median hourly pay for men was more than 15% higher than for women. About 1,000 reported pay for women was higher. Almost 1,200 reported a negligible gap, a number that is statistically improbable. That's raised questions about the reporting requirements and whether companies disclosed properly.

People Save More After Retirement

Retirees consume less, pay off debt and save more the opposite of what people in retirement are expected to do, according to "http://papers.nber.org/tmp/38267-w24405.pdf" by Arna Olafsson of Copenhagen Business School and Michaela Pagel of Columbia Business School. "Any rational agent who expects a fall in income at retirement will save before retirement and dissave after retirement, rather than the other way around," they write. The researchers studied several data sets, including U.S. surveys on household consumption and data from a personal finance management software used by European banks. They attempted to reconcile the findings with various theories, all of which failed to answer the "retirement-consumption puzzle," they said.

Banks Should Hold More Equity and Less Debt

Replacing the Dodd-Frank law with rules that require banks to limit their debt and rely more on equity "just might give us a much safer financial system at a much lower cost," Michael L. Davis of Southern Methodist University"https://bit.ly/2q4Qyza", which is published by the libertarian Cato Institute. Proposed legislation would allow banks to avoid certain regulations if they increase capital, but lawmakers "need to get the technical details right, most importantly the proper definition of bank capital," he says. Forcing banks to respond to market signals by basing standards on market values of equity, not book value, seems like "an obviously good idea," he writes.

Mulvaney Responds to Warren

If Sen. Elizabeth Warren isn't satisfied with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Acting Director Mick Mulvaney's "responses to her frequent inquiries, I would remind her that she is the one who conceived of the bureau to be  [f]ree of legislative micromanaging,'" Mr. Mulvaney writes in a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mick-mulvaney-replies-to-elizabeth-warren-1522775939". His rebuttal to a Journal opinion column by Mr. Warren also says he didn't kill the payday rule and the bureau is simply reviewing it, and there is no mandate that all CFPB employees, excepting the director, must be hired on merit, as Ms. Warren suggested.

Banking & Finance: Collapse of Fintech Firm Puts Focus On Lax IPO Rules

By Jean Eaglesham and Aaron Back

The most successful company to use post-financial crisis rules to list in the stock market has lost 85% of its value in six trading days, highlighting the risks for individual investors from a program designed to help small companies go public.

Longfin Corp., a financial technology company that does nearly all of its business in Singapore, listed its shares on Nasdaq in December. On Monday, the company said it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's rapid rise and epic collapse highlights flaws in how gatekeepers such as the SEC, stock exchanges and index providers are policing the fast-track method used by Longfin to sell shares to the public, regulators and lawyers said.

Making it easier for small companies to do IPOs is a "good thing if you think that public markets are important to capital formation," said Adam Pritchard, a law professor at the University of Michigan. But he added that there is an inescapable trade-off: "if you make the screens not as fine, then you're going to have more bad apples."

Longfin raised $5.7 million in an initial public offering in December using a provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, known as Reg A+, which was designed to allow young companies easier access to public markets by setting lower accounting and disclosure standards than for conventional IPOs.

In the years after the financial crisis, cautious investors were unwilling to fund small companies, but well before the law took effect in 2015, a gusher of private capital poured into startups. Now, public markets have been overtaken by private capital, which totaled at least $2.4 trillion last year.

By contrast, these Reg A+ offerings were used to raise a total of $400 million from 2015 through December, according to a review by consulting firm Audit Analytics.

Only 40 of more than 290 companies -- most with no revenue -- that sought to use the rules completed their offerings, the review found, and fewer still have gone on to a public listing. Longfin is one of 10 mini-IPOs to list on U.S. exchanges or over-the-counter using Reg A+ and the only one to be trading over its offer price, according to Dealogic.

Longfin's short but turbulent history since its February 2017 formation -- including a 13-fold rise in its stock after it bought a cryptocurrency company, the resignation of its chief financial and chief operating officers just before the IPO, and the SEC investigation -- is a warning about the due diligence done by the SEC on these companies, a state regulator said.

If the SEC is "going to rubber stamp even the minimum requirements . . . it opens the door to scams and fraud," said William Galvin, Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth. He said these offerings are more dangerous than private deals that are usually restricted to wealthy or professional investors because small investors can buy the shares.

An SEC spokesman declined to comment. The SEC said in 2015 the Reg A+ rules it had just agreed to offered "an effective, workable path to raising capital that also provides strong investor protections."

Longfin's CEO Venkat Meenavalli, who owns 90% of the company's shares, said that Longfin "went through a stringent process of [approval by] SEC and Nasdaq" and that its filings are being unfairly judged against the tougher standards set for bigger companies.

Longfin, which runs its U.S. operations out of a three-desk office in New York, said in a filing Monday that 100% of its net sales are "outside of the U.S." The SEC accepted Longfin's assurances that it intends to expand its presence in the U.S. The regulator also approved the mini-IPO despite multiple misstatements in Longfin's disclosures, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Longfin shares fell nearly 30% on Tuesday, the day after it disclosed the SEC investigation and reported material weaknesses in financial controls. The company, which said it is cooperating with the probe, said it may not be able to continue as a going concern unless it attracts more capital.

Steve Cohen now has one less legal battle on his plate.

The billionaire hedge fund manager and his former fund, SAC Capital, were cleared in a long-running legal saga over Fairfax Financial Holdings when a New Jersey state court found it did not have jurisdiction over the dispute.

The Canadian insurance company had accused Mr Cohen, SAC and other big-name hedge fund managers more than 10 years ago of conspiring to drive down the company s share price using dirty tricks.

The case had been revived a year ago by an appellate court, which overturned a ruling dismissing them from the lawsuit and sending it back to the lower court for further hearings.

The case had accused a group of funds that originally also included Dan Loeb s Third Point Capital and Jim Chanos s Kynikos Associates of racketeering for allegedly working together to drive down Fairfax s share price so they could profit from short selling the shares.

The court granted Mr Cohen and SAC s motion to dismiss the case in a ruling late last week.

 Because plaintiffs have not pointed to any continuous and systematic contacts between the SAC defendants and New Jersey making the SAC defendants at home in New Jersey and have not demonstrated knowledge on behalf of the SAC defendants that their alleged conspiracy would cause injury in New Jersey, the court finds no basis for personal jurisdiction in this forum,  the court ruled.

It isn t the end of Mr Cohen s legal woes. He and his family office, Point72, are also defending a lawsuit against the firm s head of talent analytics who has accused them of rampant sexism and discrimination.

China fintech groups ride boom to list in US

Fintech changed how the Chinese make payments, transact business, buy insurance, lend money, and invest capital. It also spawned a cohort of start-ups that have listed on international stock exchanges, providing high-growth investment opportunities. But there are also risks.

Last year, China Rapid Finance Ltd, Qudian Inc, Hexindai Inc, Jianpu Technology and PPDAI Group Inc went public in the US.

 The fintech market in China is at least one generation ahead of the US, if not two,  said Schulte Research founder Paul Schulte.

Listing in November 2017, Jianpu Technology Inc is an independent financial platform   essentially, an Amazon for financial services in China. It offers individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises 170,000 products from 2,500 financial providers. For example, users can apply for loans via mobile, and get approved for Rmb5,000 ($790) within five minutes.

 In China, we have people already online that are eager for credit,  said David Ye, Jianpu Co-founder, chairman and chief executive. Mr Ye used his career experiences at PayPal, Capital One, American Express, and America Online to co-found Jianpu s parent company, Rong360, in 2011.  The fintech space is going to be bigger than social networking, than ecommerce, than travel,  he said.

Jianpu s Beijing headquarters have glass walls, greenery, table football, dart board, martial arts dummy, treadmills, and brainstorming lounge. The front desk is curved and coloured different shades of blue. Conference rooms are named after Chinese rivers. These design and nomenclature align with feng shui and are intended to represent financial liquidity.

The lobby houses a robot that is about 7ft tall, which Jianpu hopes will become users   financial partner.  Employing facial recognition, it scrapes information from China s national identification system and other sources to make personalised financial recommendations. Jianpu intends to scale the robot down and place them in offices and public domains around the country.

Jianpu has more than 80m registered users and expects to have 200m by 2020. China had 724m mobile internet users last year, many of whom are early adopters of innovative new products. According to the 2017 EY FinTech Adoption Index, 69 per cent of China s digitally active users have adopted fintech solutions, compared with 33 per cent in the US.

There is little delineation between users  real and financial lives. E-commerce and other technology companies routinely offer financial services.

Mr Schulte said Alibaba in particular excels at collating information on customers  civic, personal, and professional lives.  Alibaba has captured on this in ways no Western company can dream of,  he said.

There are hurdles, though, for fintech users, companies, and investors. Consumer privacy is worrisome. A 2017 study by the China Consumer Association found that respondents  primary online concern was the  disclosure of privacy and lack of protection of user s personal information .

For companies, their databases are geographically specific. Chinese enterprises have less data on foreign consumers, which inhibits international expansion.

Hiring candidates with both technological and financial expertise is also arduous. Not all suit-wearing, middle-aged financial services professionals   who are accustomed to plush offices   desire to work with jeans-wearing, 20-somethings in open office environments.  Culturally, that s very hard,  said the 45-year-old Mr Ye.

Competition is intense. More start-ups, traditional financial services corporations, and e-commerce companies are offering fintech services.

Additionally, technology changes rapidly. To evolve with big data and artificial intelligence, roughly three-fifths of Jianpu s more than 700 employees are in technology or engineering roles. Mr Ye continues learning, too. Almost five years ago, he enrolled in an EMBA programme at Tsinghua University in Beijing. He hopes to graduate this year.  Lifetime learning is very important,  he said.

For investors, there s ambiguity around appropriate valuation metrics for this fledgling sector, which meshes finance with technology. According to Mr Schulte, bank stock prices trade at around their book value. Technology companies trade at a premium   six to eight times their book value.

Ron Cao, founder and managing director of Sky9 Capital, an early-stage China technology VC firm, invested in Jianpu and PPDai, where he remains a board member. He said even experienced investors are learning how to evaluate fintech companies.  This is a new breed of companies. So it will take some time for the market to understand them more,  he said.

There is also regulatory uncertainty. In recent years, Chinese policymakers have bolstered oversight of the peer-to-peer lending industry. This benefits consumers and surviving P2P companies, but could wipe out thousands of underperforming companies.

In November, Chinese fintech stock prices suffered double-digit declines on worries of new regulations and under-reported bad debts. Lending company valuations have languished since then. As a technology platform that eschews credit, market, liquidity, and regulatory risk, Jianpu s shares rebounded.

Mr Cao said innovation sometimes leads regulation, but that Chinese regulators are progressive and their recent crackdowns will be supportive to the market s long-term development.  That s good for entrepreneurship because we know the [regulatory] direction. The worst is no man s land,  he said.

For successful companies, there is a lot at stake. According to JPMorgan research, China s fintech market could grow 44 per cent annually, with the industry s total revenue in 2020 reaching Rmb460bn. The Boston Consulting Group forecasts that China s individual investable assets will hit Rmb220tn by 2021.

Mr Ye said another 300m-400m Chinese need financial services.  They want to borrow. They want to buy insurance. They want to invest. They want to get their first credit card,  he said.

According to Brookings, there are 27 fintech  unicorns    or start-ups with valuations of $1bn or more. Nine are in mainland China or Hong Kong and 12 are in the US. With market growth, more start-ups are expected to go public, and many will opt for listings in the US.

Tencent closes in on Alipay crown

For years the winner of China s $6tn mobile payments was a foregone conclusion in favour of long-time incumbent Alipay.

As recently as 2014, more than 80 per cent of China s mobile payments were conducted on Alipay, the crown jewel asset of Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. Rivals such as WeChat Pay, the payments platform of internet and social media group Tencent, were considered negligible competition.

That has started to change. The exact number of users and income from payments are a tightly held secret at both Alipay and WeChat Pay, but the two are now considered neck and neck. Tencent president Martin Lau even boasted late last month that Tenpay now has more active users than Alipay, although he did not give specific figures.

A new report released this week by consultants Analysys found that atthe end of 2017, Alipay held about 54.3 per cent of the mobile payments market, while WeChat Pay claimed 38.2 per cent.

This rapid growth has contributed to a stunning surge in Tencent's valuation.One of its largest shareholders, South African media company Naspers,said last monththat it would sell more than $10bn of shares in the company, cutting its stake forthe first time in almost two decades from 33 to 31 per cent.Naspers  original 2001 investment of $32m in Tencent is now worth $175bn.

The success of both Tencent and Alipayhas been inextricably tied to their ecosystems. For Alipay, that means a tight linking to the online shopping universe of Taobao, where Chinese users can buy everything from French cheese to distressed property assets andshares in listed banks.

OnSingle s Day, an online shopping festival invented by Alibaba, Chinese people spent $25bn on Taobao in a single day last year, with the majority of the transactions supported by Alipay.

But Tencent users have witnessed a rapid expansion ofthe company s WeChat platform. Three years ago, WeChat was primarily used to chat with friends and share photos. Today it has become a full-blown lifestyle platform where users can book plane tickets, order delivery, read news and hail a taxi, all while chatting and sharing plans with friends.

 That intersection of social and commerce has driven usage of the underlying WeChat Pay infrastructure, which has given them an edge in payments,  said Zennon Kapron, a payments specialist at consulting firm Kapronasia Shanghai.  Alipay is still leveraging it's lead in ecommerce to maintain market share, but the market is rapidly moving beyond just ecommerce and Alipay risks being left behind. 

Tencent s progress is showing broader results in connecting with high-profile partners. Only last week, Walmart said it wasgetting rid of Alipayin its stores in western China in order to bring in Tencent in its place. Walmarttold Reutersthat it was a  business decision to improve customer experience .

The fight for China s payments market has been at the heart of the fierce, long-running struggle between Alibaba and Tencent.

Tencent was launched by Ma Huateng in 1998 as an online messaging service. Alibaba followed a year later as an upstart ecommerce platform led by Jack Ma. Alipay, which was originally part of the Taobao online shopping mall, was one of the country s earliest Web-based payment platforms when it went live in 2003. WeChat Pay, which is part of the eponymous mobile chatting app, would not launch for another decade.

The two companies have fought a number of proxy wars to dominate certain markets. In 2013, both groups were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidise rides on rival ride-hailing applications. The same tussle has played out in bike-sharing, with the companies backing rivals ofo and Mobike.

The scene for the nextbattle between the payments platforms could be set in China s countryside.

The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, an affiliate of the World Bank, noted in December that there are about 100m people in China s countryside who are using mobile payments compared to about 400m in the cities. But the countryside is home to some 407m who neither use mobile payments nor the internet, giving the companies a huge market to conquer.

The social functions of WeChat that have seen such rapid pick-up in urban settings are likely to be highly popular among rural users as they come online,CGAP says.  The trend will probably be even more pronounced in rural settings, where WeChat is widely popular among first-time smartphone owners,  according to the CGAP report.

Further fintech fascination

Chipping awayTechnology companies are set totake a big chunkof customers from banks, as they intensify their challenge to traditional lenders across a range of mass-market financial services, say industry executives and analysts. Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, told the Financial Times that Italy s biggest bank by market capitalisation expects to lose market share to digitally focused rivals in many mainstream areas such as payments.But he added that most older, wealthy Italian clients would be reluctant to entrust their money to tech groups   prompting it to focus on areas such as insurance andasset management. His comments are backed up bynew research predicting North American banks could lose more than a third of revenues from traditional savings, lending and investment activities to tech-based rivals,including some backed bybanks themselves, according to Citigroup s Bank of the Future  report.

Down timeCapital markets fintech ventures attracted less than half as much equity funding last year as they did in 2015 and 2016, according to a study from the Boston Consulting Group, the consultancy.The declinecomes even as investment banks and exchanges are still exploring ways to harness broad technology changes such as artificial intelligence and automation.

China crackdownThousands of online lenders could be facing extinction as China rolls out a newlicensing framework, amid complaints about a lack of clarity on how the regime will work. The peer-to-peer lending sector is braced for a second regulatory crackdown as a new  record filing  system kicks off in April. But with the first batch of approvals expected by the end of the month, lenders say they are still in the dark on the filing process itself.

Existential thoughtsMarcus Schenck, one of the most senior executives at Deutsche Bank, believes that bank accounts as we know them nowcould disappearin as little as five years. MrSchenck,co-head of corporate and investment banking at the German lender, told Bloomberg's European Capital Markets Forum that a recent trip to China had opened his eyes to the fact that the retail banking sector is ripe for disruption from new technologies.Chris Skinner, author of the Finanser blog, agrees that banking is being "reinvented from the ground up for the digital age".

GE to Sell Part of Health-Care Division to Veritas Capital for $1.05 Billion; New private-equity owner to transition the value-based care division to a stand-alone company

General Electric Co. has reached a deal to sell part of its health-care information-technology business to private-equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion in cash, the latest move from the conglomerate to streamline its operations.

Veritas said Monday that an affiliate entered into an agreement to buy GE Healthcare's value-based care division, comprising of Enterprise Financial Management, Ambulatory Care Management and Workforce Management, formerly API Healthcare.

Veritas said it would work alongside GE management to transition the business into a stand-alone company. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter.

"Our team has significant knowledge and expertise in the health-care IT space, and by operating as a stand-alone business under Veritas' ownership, we now have the opportunity to further revitalize our product portfolio and pursue complementary acquisitions," said Jon Zimmerman, vice president and general manager of value-based care solutions at GE Healthcare, in prepared remarks.

GE Chief Executive John Flannery has discussed plans to divest about $20 billion worth of assets as part of his strategy to turnaround the struggling conglomerate. In October, The Wall Street Journal "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-explores-exiting-from-the-railroad-business-1509031146" a buyer for part or all of its health-care information-technology business, people familiar with the matter had said at the time.

GE Healthcare, which makes MRI machines and other equipment used in hospitals and laboratories, is one of the company's biggest divisions with about $19 billion in revenue last year. The company is selling a small part of that division that provides software to manage health-care staffing and payroll services.

"GE Healthcare will continue to significantly invest in core digital solutions, such as smart diagnostics, connected devices, AI and enterprise imaging, that will drive precision health for our customers," Kieran Murphy, president and chief executive of GE Healthcare, said in prepared remarks.

Veritas has been focusing on health-care technology investments, all of which have been corporate carve-outs, the company said. It acquired Truven, formerly the health-care division of Thomson Reuters Corp., for $1.25 billion in 2012 and sold the business to International Business Machines Corp. for $2.6 billion in 2016.

In 2016 Veritas acquired Verisk Health, the health-care services business of Verisk Analytics Inc., in a roughly $820 million deal. Verisk Health was rebranded as Verscend Technologies Inc.

GE shares fell 2.7% to close at $13.12 on Monday amid a broader market selloff. The stock is down 56% in the past year.

Intesa Sanpaolo plans asset management merger

The chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo plans to merge its asset management business with a rival while keeping control in a deal designed to help the Italian bank respond to the growing threat of technology-focused rivals.

Carlo Messina told the Financial Times that while digital challengers willtake a significant share of mass-market customers from banks, he believes they will find it harder to compete for older, wealthier clients.

This is one reason Italy s biggest bank by market capitalisation aims to bulk up its insurance and private banking activities and is seeking a merger partner in asset management.

 We are studying the possibility to make a strategic alliance with a big player in assets under management and we are ready to also sell a minority stake in order to have a possibility to play a game of consolidation of assets under management in Europe,  he said.

Last year, Intesa said it had dropped its takeover interest in Assicurazioni Generali, Italy s biggest insurance company, deciding it could instead achieve an extra  ¬1bn of profits by expanding its insurance and wealth management operations organically.

Mr Messina said it also aims  to create an Amundi equivalent , referring to the company created by merging the asset management arms of Crdit Agricole and Socit Gnrale.

 If you make the segmentation of your client base, you have the family, so mass market, and you have affluent, you have private clients, ultra high net worth, so you have a lot of kinds of clients with different needs,  said Mr Messina.

Many young people never go into bank branches and instead carry out financial transactions on mobile phones. But Mr Messina said the majority of Intesa s affluent customers were more than 60 years old and still valued being able to  look in the eyes  of a relationship manager.

While Facebook and other  big tech  companies are facing a backlash for mis-handling customers  data, Mr Messina said banks had a potential advantage in being considered more trustworthy custodians of people s money and their financial information.

 If you asked my clients would you prefer to have your information, your data, with your relationship manager or with Google or others, they can answer:  I prefer Intesa Sanpaolo ,  he said.

 The relations with clients is from one side the area from which you need to have reputation and trust and from the other side it is the area that can be the mitigant to the threat from Google, Facebook and all the others in this fintech new world,  he said.

To burnish its reputation, Intesa recently announced plans to create a  ¬1.2bn  impact fund  to lend to new families, university students, researchers, start-up businesses and female entrepreneurs. It is also promising 10,000 meals a day and 6,000 beds for people in need.

Mr Messina said banks would need to partner with fintechs in consumer payments and other mass-market financial services to maintain their relationships with younger customers.

 There is a portion of the strategy for the future that can be set to be sure to manage in the right way the mass market, the payments area; make a combination with these competitors; try to invest in start-ups; try to invest in advanced analytics in the bank,  he said.

Tensions run high at Deutsche Bank amid rift between chairman and chief

Financials

John Cryan's appointment as chief executive of Deutsche Bank in 2015 was intended to herald a fresh start for the German lender after years of lacklustre returns, a battered share price and a legacy of legal cases.

However, three years on and the nononsense veteran banker's position is looking vulnerable after it emerged that Paul Achleitner, the bank's chairman, has, for some months, been quietly sounding out potential successors to the Briton.

The relationship between the affable Austrian, who has chaired Germany's largest lender since 2012, and the dry-humoured Mr Cryan, installed as a turnround chief, was never an easy one.

But, since late last year, it has become increasingly fraught, according to several people familiar with the inner workings of Deutsche.

The pressure on Deutsche is intensifying ahead of what looks likely to be a fiery annual meeting in May.

There are two versions circulating in Frankfurt about what has caused a deterioration severe enough to make Mr Achleitner consider replacing the chief prematurely. One is that the bank's poor performance in the past few months had undermined the chairman's trust in his chief executive's ability to deliver. The other is that Mr Achleitner is prepared to sacrifice his chief in an attempt to safeguard his own position at a time when large shareholders are increasingly losing patience.

The first version of events has been promoted by people close to Mr Achleitner. In the space of a few months, Deutsche has reported its third annual loss in a row, suffered further declines in investment banking revenue and dropped its 2018 cost-cutting target. This, combined with Mr Cryan's alleged "lack of leadership", is said to have "shocked" Mr Achleitner.

"It just appears as if John is lacking the resolve to put the strategy in practice," said a person familiar with the chairman's thinking, adding that "the supervisory board is really puzzled about what has been going on with him".

Tension in the relationship between the chairman and the chief emerged more than a year ago.

One sticking point was Mr Cryan's lukewarm treatment of Chinese investor HNA, as he avoided meeting his biggest shareholder for many months. While a person close to Mr Achleitner talked down that spat, the executive board's late revelation to the supervisors in December that it wanted to pay out  ¬1bn more in bonuses than previously thought profoundly irritated the chairman. "This came as a complete surprise to the supervisory board," said an insider.

Several people say the differences between the two stretch to strategic questions. A key issue is the future of the investment bank.

According to two people familiar with boardroom discussions, Mr Cryan is toying with much deeper cuts in the investment banking division, which Mr Achleitner wants to avoid   a position backed by the two Qatari funds that are among Deutsche's largest shareholders and which want the lender to re-emphasise its investment banking franchise.

"[Mr Cryan and Mr Achleitner] just need to make a decision on the investment bank strategy; that is what is behind all this," said one boardroom insider.

After years of decline, a growing number of bankers are advocating much more radical cuts at the franchise that generates almost half of Deutsche's revenue. "Without radical steps   a drastic reduction of the investment bank   Deutsche almost looks like a break-up case," said a senior Frankfurt banker working for a global rival.

With regard to shrinking the investment bank, a person with inside knowledge said: "John knows what needs to be done, but Paul is hesitant."

The planned appointments to the supervisory board   including Michele Trogni, an executive at IHS Markit, and Mayree Clark, a former Morgan Stanley executive   will bolster its investment banking, data analytics and wealth management expertise.

John Thain was CEO of the New York Stock Exchange from 2004-07, when he took charge of Merrill Lynch just as the financial crisis hit and sold it to Bank of America a year later amid heavy criticism of big bonuses paid to executives. A fourth nominee is Norbert Winkeljohann of PwC.

In mid-March, James von Moltke, Deutsche's chief financial officer, hinted that more radical cuts at the investment bank would not be taboo. "An attempt to do something radical is [ ... ] something one has to give thought to," he told analysts, with the caveat that such a decision would be "very challenging, difficult and painful".

This week, it emerged that Deutsche had launched a review of underperforming investment banking divisions in a project dubbed "Colombo".

People loyal to Mr Cryan point out that the bank's woes would not disappear under a new chief. A senior Deutsche executive said: "It's hard to see what could be done differently. John's strategy is clearly the right one. And he is executing it efficiently. Replacing him doesn't solve anything."

Mr Cryan's supporters point to the  ¬2.6bn in costs that have been taken out since 2015, the successful initial public offering of asset manager DWS and the bank's better-than-perceived 2017 performance in fixed income and currencies. "The public perception that our market share and revenue are in free fall is simply not true," a senior banker said.

A number of observers in Frankfurt interpret Mr Achleitner's actions as an attempt to distract from his own shortcomings. "I am really surprised that investors have been holding on to Mr Achleitner for so long," said a senior banker at an international rival.

In a letter to Deutsche's staff on Wednesday, Mr Cryan made clear he would not leave his job voluntarily, pointing out he was "absolutely committed to serving our bank". The fact that Mr Achleitner seems to be finding it difficult to attract a potential replacement might also help to calm the waters.

Thain to Join Deutsche Board

By Jenny Strasburg

John Thain, former chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange and crisis-era leader of Merrill Lynch & Co., is expected to join Deutsche Bank AG's supervisory board in May, according to a person familiar with the board's plans.

Mr. Thain, a former longtime Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive and more recently CEO of midsize lender CIT Group Inc., is one of four nominees who have been invited by the German lender's supervisory board to fill seats coming open this year, the person said.

The 20-member board plans to submit the nominees to shareholders for election at the bank's annual meeting May 24.

Mr. Thain, 62 years old, would be a high-profile addition to Deutsche Bank's supervisory board at a trying time for the lender. John Cryan, its CEO since 2015, and the board are being tested by three consecutive full-year losses and missed cost-cutting targets, as well as high-level tensions over strategy and performance.

The Wall Street Journal and other media reported this week that Deutsche Bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, has reached out externally to potential candidates to replace Mr. Cryan, citing people briefed on the discussions. The outreach raises the possibility that Mr. Cryan could leave before his contract ends in 2020,

Mr. Achleitner didn't respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Cryan didn't address the reports directly, but a day later told employees in a memo the bank made public that he is "absolutely committed" to serving the lender and carrying out its turnaround strategy.

Other nominees to the supervisory board are Michele Trogni, former executive at data and analytics firm IHS Markit Ltd. and UBS Group AG, and Mayree Clark, a former longtime Morgan Stanley wealth-management executive, according to the person familiar with the board's plans.

The fourth nominee is already known: Deutsche Bank previously announced that Norbert Winkeljohann, a European executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, would be nominated to the supervisory board this year.

Mr. Thain didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The other nominees weren't immediately reached.

Mr. Thain's nomination was earlier reported by Germany's WirtschaftsWoche.

Deutsche Bank, like other German companies, has a dual-board structure. The CEO-led management board is directly responsible for strategy and operations; the supervisory board appoints, oversees and dismisses management-board members.

Mr. Thain would bring a long history of experience in financial services, some of it tumultuous.

Early in his career, he spent more than two decades at Goldman Sachs, working his way up the ranks to co-chief operating officer and president. In 2004, he became head of the New York Stock Exchange. He then became chief executive of Merrill Lynch in late 2007, when the investment bank was grappling with debilitating mortgage-related losses.

He helped orchestrate Merrill's sale to Bank of America Corp. at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, then lost his job and was lambasted by investors, regulators and politicians for big bonuses paid to Merrill employees.

He later told the Journal that he regretted taking the job and having to sell Merrill to Bank of America.

Mr. Thain then earned credit for shepherding a turnaround at CIT Group. He left CIT in 2016.

Vanguard Clients Gripe at Snafus

Louise Robbins bought shares in an exchange-traded fund last Friday afternoon as markets fell, knowing that she had enough money in her Vanguard Group settlement fund to pay for the trade.

Tuesday morning, the 60-year-old Boston book editor received an erroneous email saying her settlement account didn't have sufficient funds to pay for the transaction. A Vanguard spokesman confirmed that other retail clients received similar messages and the problem would be resolved without customers having to take any action.

The recent settlement-fund snafu is part of a larger perception problem facing the $5.1 trillion money manager: Customers say Vanguard's size and record inflows are increasingly putting strains on an enterprise known for its devoted customer following and low costs.

Vanguard is one of the biggest beneficiaries of an investor shift over the past decade to cheaper passively managed investment products that track the performance of indexes. It pulled in a record $369.3 billion in new investor money in 2017. It has long had a nearly pristine reputation among customers attracted to the firm's principles of low-cost, long-term investing.

Over the past year, some customers have complained via Twitter, investment discussion forums and interviews with The Wall Street Journal of technical problems, administrative foibles and service across Vanguard's brokerage and retirement businesses.

Some of these complaints were aired on bogleheads.org, a popular online investing website named after Vanguard founder John C. Bogle. The full scope of the service issues at Vanguard isn't known.

Over the past year, sentiment expressed about Vanguard on Twitter has been less favorable than opinions about rival brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Investments, according to Social Market Analytics, Inc., a company that uses information on social media to analyze how companies are perceived.

Issues flagged by Vanguard customers include incorrect cost-basis information -- what investors paid for shares in a fund -- shown on their accounts, and problems with required minimum distributions for retirees, incorrect account balances displayed online, long customer-service wait times and login troubles. Some of the problems identified by customers have the potential to trigger tax consequences for investors.

A company spokesman said "these are periodic systems issues unrelated to our growth." He added that "Vanguard is increasingly focused on investing in the people and technology to serve our clients more effectively and efficiently, protect investor assets, and enhance fund performance."

Vanguard isn't the only investing firm to experience technical problems of late. Earlier this year, it was one of several brokerage and mutual-fund firms that suffered outages and slowdowns as market turmoil sent individual investors scrambling to access their accounts.

"It's kind of a shame that Mr. Bogle's creation, which is extraordinary, has been somewhat sullied by their performance administratively," said former Vanguard client Barry Bergsman.

The retired Los Angeles media and marketing executive said he experienced problems last year when he decided to move his Vanguard accounts to a more "hands-on" wealth management firm.

Mr. Bergsman said he instructed Vanguard to transfer some fund positions to a custodian that would complete the account transition and instead those positions were liquidated, leaving him with a "substantial" tax bill.

He said Vanguard didn't quickly resolve the issue and he lost patience, ultimately paying the tax bill.

Some Vanguard clients who have 403(b) retirement plans have complained about administrative problems after Vanguard outsourced some of its record-keeping duties to the Newport Group in 2017. A spokeswoman for Newport Group declined to comment. A 403(b) plan is typically offered to teachers, clergy and some medical workers.

Chris Herbert, who manages four accounts at Vanguard including his wife's 403(b) retirement plan, noticed last year that the value of his wife's 403(b) account appeared to be $120,000 less than it was supposed to be. Four of the eight funds in the account were missing in both online and print statements.

Mr. Herbert, who is retired and lives in Tempe, Ariz., said he corresponded with customer-service representatives by phone and online for several weeks before the problem was resolved.

"I don't want to leave Vanguard, but problems like these lead you to ask if this is going to continue to occur," he said.

Earlier this week, a new technical problem surfaced at Vanguard that hadn't occurred before: some customers who made new investments received emails erroneously informing them that there were insufficient funds in their relevant settlement accounts.

Issues flagged by Vanguard customers include incorrect cost-basis information -- what investors paid for shares in a fund -- shown on their accounts, and problems with required minimum distributions for retirees, incorrect account balances displayed online, long customer-service wait times and login troubles. Some of the problems identified by customers have the potential to trigger tax consequences for investors.

A company spokesman said "these are periodic systems issues unrelated to our growth." He added that "Vanguard is increasingly focused on investing in the people and technology to serve our clients more effectively and efficiently, protect investor assets, and enhance fund performance."

Vanguard isn't the only investing firm to experience technical problems of late. Earlier this year, it was one of several brokerage and mutual-fund firms that suffered outages and slowdowns as market turmoil sent individual investors scrambling to access their accounts.

"It's kind of a shame that Mr. Bogle's creation, which is extraordinary, has been somewhat sullied by their performance administratively," said former Vanguard client Barry Bergsman.

The retired Los Angeles media and marketing executive said he experienced problems last year when he decided to move his Vanguard accounts to a more "hands-on" wealth management firm.

Mr. Bergsman said he instructed Vanguard to transfer some fund positions to a custodian that would complete the account transition and instead those positions were liquidated, leaving him with a "substantial" tax bill.

He said Vanguard didn't quickly resolve the issue and he lost patience, ultimately paying the tax bill.

Some Vanguard clients who have 403(b) retirement plans have complained about administrative problems after Vanguard outsourced some of its record-keeping duties to the Newport Group in 2017. A spokeswoman for Newport Group declined to comment. A 403(b) plan is typically offered to teachers, clergy and some medical workers.

Chris Herbert, who manages four accounts at Vanguard including his wife's 403(b) retirement plan, noticed last year that the value of his wife's 403(b) account appeared to be $120,000 less than it was supposed to be. Four of the eight funds in the account were missing in both online and print statements.

Mr. Herbert, who is retired and lives in Tempe, Ariz., said he corresponded with customer-service representatives by phone and online for several weeks before the problem was resolved.

"I don't want to leave Vanguard, but problems like these lead you to ask if this is going to continue to occur," he said.

Earlier this week, a new technical problem surfaced at Vanguard that hadn't occurred before: some customers who made new investments received emails erroneously informing them that there were insufficient funds in their relevant settlement accounts.

OneConnect, a subsidiary of China s largest insurance company that sells technology platforms to smaller banks, is preparing an initial public offering in Hong Kong that could launch this year, say two people familiar with the matter.

The timing of the deal for the Ping An company has not yet been determined, they said.

One banker involved in the offer estimated it could raise more than $2bn. Bloomberg reported the deal could happen as soon as September, and would involve Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and CCB International.

OneConnect raised $650m this year, valuing it at $7.4bn, Ping An said in its annual results for 2017. The company declined to comment on the IPO.

Ping An is a vast financial conglomerate with a background in insurance, banking and trust businesses. During the past five years it has launched dozens of start-ups focused on areas such as medical care, financial technology, online car sales and artificial intelligence.

As one of the conglomerate s start-ups, OneConnect started as an internal unit that developed financial technology for the group. During the past four years, it has launched an outward-facing business that sells such technology to small banks, insurance companies and non-bank financial institutions around China.

Services include everything from credit checks and interbank transactions to product sales and mobile applications for retail banking services. OneConnect has sold its products to 468 banks and 1,890 non-bank financial institutions, and handled more than 900m credit inquiries last year, according to Ping An.

Ping An has joined other large Chinese technology and internet groups that have nurtured portfolios of start-ups and are now positioning the groups for fundraisings and IPOs.

Lufax, on online wealth management platform and the first sizeable anticipated spin-off from Ping An, has delayed its IPO due to regulatory concerns. Ping An Healthcare & Technology, which owns the health platform Good Doctor, filed for a $1bn IPO in February.

Chinese internet group Tencent has taken a similar approach to launching IPOs for companies it has developed, such as Tencent Literature, which raised more than $1bn late last year in a Hong Kong listing.

A handful of large Chinese tech IPOs are lined up for 2018 debuts after similar Chinese companies raised $7.6bn globally, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

State Budgets Face Historic Squeeze --- Medicaid, pensions consume highest proportion of nonfederal tax revenues since 1960s

Corrections & Amplifications

A chart showing year-over-year change in per capita gross investment in new infrastructure by state and local governments that appeared with a March 29 Page One article about state budgets incorrectly omitted a footnote stating that the data were adjusted for inflation.

(WSJ April 11, 2018)

(END)

The only speaker standing between state budget officers and the opening cocktail hour at a Washington conference was the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. What he said left no one in a celebratory mood.

Medicaid costs, said then-Secretary Michael Leavitt, were projected to grow so fast that within 10 years they would "crowd out virtually every other category of spending." State spending on higher education, infrastructure and safety, he predicted, would all get squeezed.

Nearly 10 years after that October 2008 speech, Mr. Leavitt's prediction -- part of HHS's first-ever annual projection of Medicaid's costs -- is looking prescient.

As state and local officials prepare their next budgets, many are finding that spending decisions have already been made for them by two must-fund line items that barely mattered when baby boomers such as Mr. Leavitt were growing up: Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled, and public-employee health and retirement costs.

These days, they consume about one out of every five tax dollars collected by state and local governments. That is the highest share since Medicaid was created in 1965. Postretirement health benefits, which are harder to quantify, add to that burden and have cumulatively cost states more than $100 billion since 2008, according to government financial disclosures compiled by Merritt Research Services.

Those costs are outpacing growth in tax revenue year after year. In 2016, state and local governments collected about $136 billion more in taxes than they did in 2008, adjusting for inflation. Two-thirds of those additional dollars went to fund pensions and Medicaid, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Commerce Department spending data.

"The more we stare at the data, the more we realize all roads lead back to Medicaid and pensions," says Dan White, a director at Moody's Analytics who has studied the issue.

The resulting revenue squeeze is making it harder for governments to pay for core services such as education, infrastructure, police and fire protection.

It also is fueling bitter state budget battles. Twenty-two states faced budget shortfalls in 2017. Ten couldn't agree on a new budget before the start of their next fiscal year. Illinois's credit rating was downgraded nearly to junk status.

To save money, states are sending less aid to cities. Many cities, in turn, are increasing fees and fines on everything from garbage collection to parking tickets. Others, such as Hartford, Conn., have teetered on the brink of bankruptcy.

The cash crunch is likely to get worse. Federal actuaries predict that Medicaid's annual cost, which was $595 billion in 2017, will exceed $1 trillion in 2026. States and many localities pay about 38% of that tab. The remainder is covered by the federal government.

Policy makers in Washington have talked about revamping entitlement programs such as Medicaid, but so far their efforts have gained little traction. That leaves it up to states to try to contain spending -- and make do with less.

Nearly 70 million Americans, about one-fifth of the population, depend on Medicaid for health coverage, including more than 28 million children. The biggest financial beneficiaries are the disabled, the elderly and poor working-age adults.

Medicaid costs have transformed state budgets. In 1964, states' top three spending items were education, highways and public welfare, according to data from the Council of State Governments. As of 2014, public welfare, which includes Medicaid, had moved into the No. 2 position.

"Governments are spending less on what they want so they can spend more on what they must spend," says Don Boyd, a senior research fellow at Rockefeller College in Albany, N.Y. "There's been a lot of crowding out."

Public-employee pensions are legally protected in most states. With Medicaid, states can set criteria for coverage, but then must pay for anyone who qualifies.

"Whatever that bill is, you have to cover it," says John Nixon, a former state budget director for Utah. In 2010, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder tapped him to run that state's budget. At the time, Michigan was spending about $1.5 billion more than it collected, Mr. Nixon says. The governor wanted to close the gap and boost funding for the state's underfunded pension and retiree health plans, among other priorities.

Mr. Nixon couldn't touch Medicaid, which then took up almost a quarter of Michigan's general fund. So he and lawmakers looked for savings elsewhere as they wrote the state's 2012 budget. Eventually, they agreed to cut $222 million from higher education, $452 million from K-12 education and $105 million from statutory tax revenue sharing with Michigan cities. Mr. Snyder, a Republican, said "tough decisions" were necessary to close Michigan's fiscal gap.

State and local governments nationwide shed 286,000 employees from 2008 to 2016, shrinking to 19.4 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's public-employment survey.

Over the past two years, Mississippi closed 10 of its 95 county health clinics, eliminating 153 positions and two inpatient drug-treatment centers. Nonprofit drug-treatment providers also lost funding.

"We have an opioid crisis going on," says Amy Turner, who runs a nonprofit drug-treatment center near Biloxi. Mississippi cut Ms. Turner's grant for treating female drug addicts by 33%.

Nationwide, state spending on higher education and local tax revenue sharing, adjusting for inflation, have both declined since 2008, according to the Journal's analysis. So has state and local spending for infrastructure.

For college students, shrinking state higher-education budgets mean paying more to attend public universities. In 1980, 48 of 50 states funded their college budgets mostly through annual appropriations of tax revenues, not from tuition. By 2017, that was true in just 20 states, as tuition had become the larger funding source in 28 states, according to data from the State Higher Education Executive Officers' Association.

"For the first time in our nation's history, we are at the cusp of college students and their families paying the majority of college costs," Robert Anderson, the group's president, testified at congressional hearing in February.

For cities, the budget squeeze means they must rely less on state aid to balance their books. The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, which tracks the budgets of 150 U.S. cities, found that 85 received less state aid in 2015 than they did in 2005. In 54 cities, aid declined by more than 10%.

Last summer, a legislative standoff over Connecticut's debt and pension costs delayed the state budget and froze aid to municipalities. In the state's capital, Hartford, Mayor Luke Bronin warned he would seek bankruptcy protection if the city didn't receive additional aid from the state.

The aid finally arrived when lawmakers reached a budget deal in October. To find money for Hartford, lawmakers took aid away from other cities, prompting some towns to shelve infrastructure projects and consider tax increases.

"State and local governments made big commitments, particularly on pensions and retiree health care, but didn't adequately fund those liabilities," says Mr. Bronin, a Democrat.

Connecticut has just 31.7% of what it needs to pay its employees' future retirement benefits, according to state financial reports. A fund for teachers has 52.3%. Together, that adds up to more than $37 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, or about $10,300 per Connecticut resident.

Connecticut's unfunded pension liabilities resulted from nearly 40 years of politicians making promises about benefits without adequately funding them, according to a 2015 study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

After the long bull market of the 1990s, seemingly flush with cash, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey and many other states sweetened retirement benefits. In 2008, stock markets plunged and those promises became harder to fund. To balance budgets, many governments skimped on annual pension contributions. The average funding level of large public pensions dropped from 100% in 2001 to 72% in 2016, according to the Public Plans Database, which tracks 170 large public plans.

Cost was an afterthought when Medicaid was enacted in 1965 under President Lyndon Johnson, who championed free health care for the poor and elderly as part of his "Great Society" program. "I'll go a hundred million or a billion on health or education," Johnson told his vice president in a March 1965 phone call, according to a recording in his presidential library. "I'll spend the goddamn money. I may cut back some tanks, but not on health."

The Medicaid legislation didn't levy taxes to pay for the program. Most states copied that approach, tapping general funds as the main revenue source and sharing some costs with local governments.

Cost wasn't a problem in the 1960s, when health care wasn't as sophisticated. "People used to go to the hospital to die back then," said Joseph Califano, who served as President Johnson's chief domestic policy aide in 1965. As treatments and longevity improved, many states also expanded Medicaid eligibility. Enrollment and costs rose.

Since 1967, the state and local share of Medicaid has grown at a compound annual rate of about 7%, exceeding the 3% annual growth in their tax revenues, adjusting for inflation, according to the Journal's calculations.

The math can overwhelm states when they hit a rough patch in tax growth. Declining tax revenue is what led to Michigan's budget cuts in 2011.

Today, the state is doing better. It has a "rainy day" fund of $889 million and is gradually increasing transportation, higher-education and K-12 funding. Michigan even expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, bringing health coverage to an additional 675,000 adults through federal matching funds that President Donald Trump wants to scale back.

John Walsh, the state budget director, says Medicaid expansion has been "physically healthy for the individuals and financially healthy for the state," since it helps lower Michigan's uncompensated health-care costs. One out of every four Michiganders now benefits from Medicaid.

The financial picture is bleaker for many Michigan cities, including East Lansing, home of Michigan State University. Since 2009, annual state funding for the city and the school has fallen by about 17% each, adjusting for inflation. To offset the cuts, the university has increased tuition repeatedly. The city, which is struggling with almost $125 million in unfunded pension and retiree health-care liabilities, has been cutting services because state law caps property tax increases.

Things came to a head last summer when East Lansing asked MSU to pony up $100 million over 20 years to help shore up the city's underfunded pension plan. The alternative, the city said, was asking voters to approve a 1% income tax that would hit university employees and working students.

After negotiations went nowhere, the city brought the income-tax proposal before voters in a referendum last November.

Undergraduate student body president Lorenzo Santavicca, 21 years old, said the measure would take away from his generation. "We are getting the short end of the stick because of commitments that were made years ago," he said.

When his 53-year-old father attended Eastern Michigan University in the 1980s, state support for higher education was so generous that he was able to cover his tuition with the money he made raking hay on his grandmother's farm during summers and selling it for $3 to $4 a bale. He graduated debt-free in 1987.

Mr. Santavicca says that to pay for his four years at MSU, he and his father have borrowed about $63,000. He expects to graduate this spring with a degree in international relations and would like to someday work in government, but he is unsure he can afford to.

On Nov. 7, East Lansing residents shot down the income-tax referendum, forcing the city to debate what services to cut to save money for the pension obligations.

Staffing cuts in the police department are making it difficult for detectives to investigate opioid overdoses, according to a police memo. The city hopes to shed another 17 police and fire positions over the next two years, but even that won't provide enough savings, according to Erik Altmann, a Democrat on the city council.

At a public hearing late last year, Mr. Altmann suggested a long list of potential cuts to make more room in the budget for increased pension payments: closing the fire station on MSU's campus, shuttering the city's pool, aquatic center, dog park and soccer complex, suspending bulk leaf pickup and plowing of public sidewalks and ending annual jazz, folk, film and art festivals.

The city is now implementing some of these and other measures.

The U.S. economy entered 2018 with stronger momentum than earlier thought, though corporate profits weakened at the end of 2017 against a backdrop of significant changes to the tax code.

Gross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S., "https://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm", adjusted for seasonality and inflation, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

That exceeded economists' expectations and was up from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gdp-growth-revised-down-to-2-5-pace-in-fourth-quarter-1519824712" growth, and only a little slower than "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-output-grew-3-2-in-third-quarter-1513863109" and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-second-quarter-gdp-rose-3-1-1506602195" in the second quarter. Consumer spending was revised higher for the fourth quarter, and private inventories exerted a smaller drag on growth than earlier thought.

Overall growth in the almost-finished first quarter is shaping up on the softer side; forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers on Wednesday projected a 1.8% growth rate for GDP in the first three months of the year.

Still, total output expanded 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier, and many economists expect another strong year in 2018 aided by tax cuts, government spending, rising incomes, low unemployment and healthy growth overseas.

"The bottom line is that the U.S. economy remains on a solid footing," said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, in a note.

Wednesday's report also contained the government's first broad estimate of profits at U.S. companies in the fourth quarter. After-tax corporate profits, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, fell 9.6% from the prior quarter and were down 6.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.

Corporate profits weakened in 2015 as the U.S. energy industry was squeezed by plunging oil prices, but earnings have picked up over the past two years.

The weak reading for the final months of 2017 may have reflected one-time effects of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/taxes-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-fourth-quarter-earnings-season-1515061801" enacted in December. The Commerce Department said "https://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2018/tech4q17_3rd.htm" in the fourth quarter changes to the expensing of bonus depreciation and a one-time repatriation tax on foreign earnings.

"I would certainly peg it to that," said Christine Short, senior vice president at analytics firm Estimize.

Among other things, the tax legislation enacted in December slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% starting Jan. 1. It scrambled fourth-quarter earnings at some large public companies due to various one-time effects, and may have created an incentive for some firms to shift earnings and expenses between late 2017 and early 2018. It could take several quarters for tax-related noise to fade from the profits data.

Ms. Short said business earnings are benefiting from solid economic growth.

"The underlying trend for 2018 is still very good," she said.

Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of total economic output. Wednesday's report said personal-consumption expenditures rose at a 4.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from a previous estimate of 3.8% growth and the strongest quarterly reading in three years.

Year-end spending was boosted by robust outlays on durable goods as many Americans replaced motor vehicles and other items damaged by "https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2018/01/26/how-hurricanes-helped-and-hurt-fourth-quarter-growth/".

Business investment remained solid in the fourth quarter, with fixed nonresidential investment rising at a 6.8% annual rate. Capital expenditures were led by 11.6% growth for spending on equipment.

The housing sector was a tailwind for growth in late 2017 as residential investment rose at a 12.8% annual pace. Government expenditures were up at a 3.0% annual rate in the fourth quarter, including a 5.5% growth rate for federal spending on national defense.

Net exports subtracted 1.16 percentage points from the quarter's 2.9% GDP growth rate, and inventories subtracted 0.53 percentage point. Both categories tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter.

Playboy Deactivates Its Facebook Accounts; Publisher cites 'mismanagement' of user data in Cambridge Analytica controversy

Playboy Enterprises Inc., the publisher of Playboy magazine, is signing off of Facebook.

"The recent news about Facebook's alleged mismanagement of users' data has solidified our decision to suspend our activity on the platform at this time," the lifestyle company founded by Hugh Hefner said Wednesday.

Playboy said it would deactivate the various Facebook pages it manages. More than 25 million Facebook users have engaged with these accounts, the company said.

A Playboy spokesman said the privately held company has no plans to return to the platform. Facebook Inc. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Facebook has been under fire after it disclosed that information about tens of millions of its users "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica-for-failing-to-delete-user-data-1521260051" to data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked with the Trump campaign in 2016 and other Republican candidates. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is expected to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-zuckerberg-expects-to-testify-at-congressional-hearing-1522172611" on the social network's handling of data.

The issues have caused some individual Facebook"https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-worry-for-facebook-disenchanted-users-1521717883?tesla=y" the platform and advertisers to cut back.

Elon Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX, had his companies' official Facebook pages taken down last week after being asked about it on Twitter, though he said it wouldn't change much. "I don't use FB & never have, so don't think I'm some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don't advertise or pay for endorsements, so &don't care," "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/977236378105798656" Friday.

Facebook on Wednesday said it would make it simpler for "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-streamline-privacy-settings-1522234802?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=6" some of the personal data Facebook tracks. The company also said it would redesign its settings menu for mobile devices and consolidate privacy and security options in a single place

Playboy, in its sharing of racy photos and celebration of sex, said it has had to censor itself over the years to stay within Facebook's strict content guidelines.

The company, whose controlling shareholder is private-equity firm Rizvi Traverse, has been "https://www.wsj.com/articles/playboy-might-kill-magazine-to-focus-on-world-of-playboy-1514808003" built around the Playboy name and bunny logo and less on its editorial roots.

Facebook shares, which have been battered by the Cambridge issue and are down more than 10% over the past week, are down less than 1% premarket Wednesday.

Humans + AI = More VC Interest; Help-desk startup Electric raises $9.3 million Series A

Venture investors are showing more interest in startups that combine data science with human work to deliver a service, says entrepreneur Ryan Denehy.

His New York startup, Electric AI Inc., offers remote IT support by relying on a help desk staffed by people. But it's also training its machine-learning algorithms on help-desk tickets with the view of automating most of the tasks.

"http://www.electric.ai/" just secured a $9.3 million Series A round led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Bob Goodman, partner at Bessemer, is joining Electric AI's board of directors.

Mr. Denehy says that his startup is similar to others that "are leveraging humans to assist machine learning, and over time rely more heavily on machine learning than humans."

StitchFix Inc. has human stylists assisted by algorithms. SelfMadeMe Inc. combines the work of photo editors with artificial intelligence. And Pilot.com Inc. s bookkeepers use software to offer a more efficient service.

For its part, Electric delivers its remote IT service via the Slack. Electric employs 10 people on its remote help desk and has local independent contractors who can quickly provide on-site service.

Electric generated revenue of $2 million in 2017 and expects to increase that four times this year, Mr. Denehy said. Previously it raised a $2 million seed round in 2016. Its seed investors Bowery Capital and Primary Venture Partners joined the Series A.

REITs Put Up the 'for Sale' Sign to Raise Cash

More real-estate assets owned by publicly listed REITs are up for sale as the gap widens between their discounted share prices and the value of private-market transactions of physical assets.

Shares of real-estate investment trusts have underperformed the broader stock market for the third year running, in part because of rising interest rates, which cause these dividend-paying stocks to lose some of their appeal. The total return of the FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs index has declined 8.8% this year, compared with a 1.8% drop in the S&P 500's total return.

Because it would be difficult to issue new shares if REITs continue to trade at discounts, some are now compelled to sell assets to raise cash to help them reposition their remaining assets or fund share buybacks.

REITs could sell individual assets, sell stakes in assets to other institutional investors and enter joint ventures in which they also could earn some management fees, or be acquired entirely and privatized by an investor.

Industry insiders said that while there are more for-sale signs popping up, these sales aren't driven by the need to reduce debt because REITs have been more disciplined since the financial crisis, so property prices aren't likely to fall drastically.

Listed REITs have been net sellers of assets since 2015, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. From January to March 23 of 2018, there were $6.91 billion in disposals, compared with $5.38 billion in acquisitions.

Disposals topped acquisitions in 2017 and 2016, $60.9 billion to $56.1 billion and $71.4 billion to $48.4 billion, respectively, Real Capital said.

"There hasn't been any reprieve in the valuation of REITs," said Gil Menna, a partner at law firm Goodwin Procter LLP. Asset sales and joint ventures with pension plans, private-equity firms and other institutional investors that have occurred in recent years "should be happening in a bigger way this year," he said.

This month Santa Monica, Calif.-based Macerich Co. sold a portion of Westside Pavilion by forming a 25%-75% joint venture with Hudson Pacific Properties to redevelop the Los Angeles shopping mall into office space.

Phoenix-based REIT Vereit Inc., formerly known as American Realty Capital Properties Inc., has unloaded real-estate assets valued at $3.2 billion from 2015 to 2017. In February, Vereit closed the sale of Cole Capital, its investment-management business, to Los Angeles-based real-estate investment firm CIM Group.

Vereit, which underwent a rebranding and replaced its board members and management team after an accounting scandal in 2014, plans to sell another $300 million to $500 million in assets this year to continue efforts to diversify its portfolio.

"If you have to sell today, instead of 10 bidders you get five," said Glenn Rufrano, Vereit's chief executive officer, noting that while there is more competition from other sellers in the office market, the REIT had started selling earlier and isn't under pressure to sell cheaply. "At this point, we're at a bit of an advantage," Mr. Rufrano said.

Cleveland-based Forest City Realty Trust in recent months has sold shopping centers to Australian institutional-investment firm QIC and some New York retail assets to Madison International Realty LLC.

Forest City has been undergoing a strategic review for the past six months with an eye toward possibly selling itself completely.The REIT said last week that its financial advisers had narrowed the bidding process to one buyer, but both parties couldn't agree on the terms of a sale. Forest Citysaid that rather than a sale, nine of its board members would resign to make room for new faces.

Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund eyes overseas expansion

Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund is considering opening offices around the world as it plans to expand its assets under management to $400bn by 2020 through overseas as well as domestic investments.

Yasir al-Rumayyan, managing director of the kingdom's Public Investment Fund said it was weighing opening up offices in the US - New York and San Francisco - the UK and Japan as it seeks to become a "global investment powerhouse'.

Speaking at a gathering of Saudi and US business leaders in New York, he said the PIF had grown from around 50 people in 2015 to 240 today and he sought to double this number by the end of the year.

The PIF has become the vehicle through which the powerful crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has sought to drive the transformation of the kingdom's economy through high-profile investments. It currently has more than $250bn assets under management.

Having visited Washington and Boston, Saudi officials are in New York as part of a US tour by the crown prince to drum up investment for the kingdom and build confidence about its economic future.

The PIF aims to raise funding from the proceeds of privatising state assets, including the planned stock market listing of energy giant Saudi Aramco, government allocations and debt.

So far it has paid $3.5bn for a stake in ride-hailing company Uber, agreed to funnel $45bn into a technology fund with Japan's softbank and put up half the capital for a $40bn infrastructure fund managed by private equity company Blackstone. It recently agreed to invest $400m in Magic Leap, which develops "mixed reality" headsets.

"We don t want to invest just in the current things. we want to enable new industries," said Mr Rumayyan, who said the kingdom was increasing its focus on robotics and artificial intelligence.

Mr Rumayyan said the PIF was being advised by Michael Klein, a former star Citigroup banker, but the fund was also looking to hire more experts in-house.

His comments come as some Saudi watchers have questioned the capabilities of the PIF to make the right investments, criticising it for following the whims of the country's highest authorities.

Mr Rumayyan said financial returns are a priority for the PIF, and all the big investments it has made so far are in companies with "outstanding growth rates". Yet he also acknowledged the challenge in making strategic decisions.

"Sometimes we have longterm views and sometimes if we have volatility on short term it will have impact on our performance," said Mr Rumayyan.

Cole Capital was Vereit's investment-management business. An earlier version incorrectly described Cole Capital as Vereit's single-tenant portfolio of commercial real estate. (March 27, 2018)

More real-estate assets owned by publicly listed REITs are up for sale as the gap widens between their discounted share prices and the value of private-market transactions of physical assets.

Shares of real-estate investment trusts have underperformed the broader equity market for the third year running, in part because of rising interest rates, which cause these dividend-paying stocks to lose some of their appeal.

Forest City said that rather than a sale, nine of its board members would resign to make room for new faces.

For pension plans and funds with more limited resources to manage the brick-and-mortar assets, establishing joint ventures is easier because the REITs can stay in place to operate the properties.

Retail REITs, which had been facing more challenges compared with other real-estate sectors due to the higher number of store closures and retailer bankruptcies, have been more active in unloading weaker assets in secondary markets.

Philadelphia-based global investment firm CenterSquare Investment Management said it is planning to make some purchases of assets put up for sale by retail REITs this year, such as neighborhood shopping centers, as well as power centers, a type of open-air shopping center with large anchors that have lost tenants.

For some power centers, CenterSquare could redevelop the asset, including shrink the retail space and add other uses to the property such as building multifamily residences or a distribution facility, said Scott Crowe, CenterSquare's chief investment strategist.

"They want to get rid of assets that we want to buy," said Mr. Crowe, noting that there also is less competition from other prospective buyers amid the uncertainties clouding the retail industry. "It's a buyers' market," he added.

Matrix Partners is raising three new funds in the U.S., India and China, according to a person familiar with the situation.

The firm is aiming to raise about $450 million for Matrix Partners XI to invest in U.S.-based early-stage startups, about $750 million for Matrix Partners China V, and roughly $300 million for Matrix Partners India III, the person said.

In the U.S., and India, the funds would be the same size as their predecessors. In China, the new fund would increase from the $500 million fund closed in 2016.

 Machine learning  helps lenders cut fraud and plan for stress tests

Banking Artificial intelligence tools offer operational cost savings, writes Laura Noonan

While chatbots are the public face of artificial intelligence in financial services, bankers are more interested in how machine learning can be used to mitigate risk.

Institutions have been quietly experimenting with the technologies to catch fraudsters, for instance, and for making credit decisions so they can lend more and lose less. At the more technical end, machine learning and AI are becoming important tools for preparing stress-test submissions, which help set the bar on how much capital banks need.

Shameek Kundu, Standard Chartered's chief data officer, says the bank spends about 40 per cent of its total AI budget on "risk in its broadest sense". AI includes machine learning that enables the analysis of vast amounts of data. Regulators are getting in on the act as well.

A November report by the Financial Stability Board, a global standard-setter, on the use of AI in financial services noted, for example, how the Australian Securities and Investments Commission was using machine learning to catch rogue financial services professionals through their marketing materials.

The report noted that in the US the Securities and Exchange Commission's machine learning techniques were "five times better" than random searches for finding "language that merits referral to enforcement", and that the tool showed "substantial promise" in the financial services industry more generally.

Fraud detection is one of the most important applications for machine learning in finance. Something as seemingly insignificant as a person using a computer in a non-typical way to complete an online form can point to potential wrongdoing.

Alexey Utkin, principal solution consultant at global technology consultancy DataArt, describes a recent case at a large bank when a fraud was thwarted by technology "that picked up the perpetrator's activity because they used the scroll bar while logged in". The real user preferred the track pad, and the machine learning technology was able to detect the anomaly because of its ability to interpret vast amounts of data.

In a report last summer, rating agency Moody's said such technology "contributes significantly to credit risk-modelling applications"   which decide whether a borrower will meet loan repayments or not   because "a machine learning model, unconstrained by some of the assumptions of classic statistical models, can yield much better insights that a human analyst could not infer from the data".

As well as helping banks sidestep fraudulent borrowers or those with poor credit, it enables them to more confidently lend to those who pass the machine learning tool's risk tests. Stan-Chart's Mr Kundu says most of its AI risk projects "are about improving our risk appetite, reducing the risk but also increasing our ability to take risk in some situations".

Half of the risk managers surveyed by McKinsey for a report published in October said they expected credit decision times to fall by 25 to 50 per cent because of AI and other digital innovations. The consultancy posited that credit losses "may fall by up to 10 per cent" because of the technology.

Charlie Delingpole, chief executive of due diligence company ComplyAdvantage, says machine learning offers a big advantage for banks in anti-money laundering and terror financing checks.

The company scans prospective clients' names and checks them against public records, media reports and other online resources to alert banks to those who breach their thresholds.

"People get tired, people make mistakes. If you have a machine doing it then necessarily it [can be] a lot more vast," says Mr Delingpole. His services are in high demand; after starting from his garage four years ago, ComplyAdvantage now has 200 clients, employs 80 people in London, New York and Romania, and will soon open in Singapore. "We're hiring super fast," he says. The FSB report cites an example of a global corporate investment bank using "unsupervised learning"   in which an algorithm is asked to detect patterns in data that have not been previously labelled   to help predict how much it might lose and how much capital it has. In another example an institution used AI to help model the performance of its capital markets business in stress tests.

Banks are reluctant to estimate the financial benefit of deploying machine learning in their risk management functions. But DataArt's Mr Utkin says the potential cost savings "are huge".

It is not all good news, however. AI's lack of "auditability" could present its own risks, the FSB report says, leading to unintended consequences. Actions decided by trading algorithms, for instance, may have negative effects when they interact with markets.

25-50% Estimated potential fall in credit decision times by using AI 10% Possible fall in credit losses from AI tools, predicted by McKinsey

Uber Sells Southeast Asia Business to Rival Grab; Latest deal follows Uber's exit from China and a merger in Russia

Uber Technologies Inc. said Monday it would relinquish its battle for Southeast Asia's riders, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-near-deal-to-exit-southeast-asia-for-stake-in-rival-1520521744" in exchange for a minority stake in homegrown champion Grab Inc.

In exchange for its operations in Southeast Asia, Uber is gaining a 27.5% stake in Singapore-based Grab, which has more monthly active users across much of the region than Uber, according to app analytics firm App Annie.

"This deal is a testament to Uber's exceptional growth across Southeast Asia over the last five years. It will help us double down on our plans for growth as we invest heavily in our products and technology to create the best customer experience on the planet," Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's CEO, said in a statement.

Mr. Khosrowshahi

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-selects-expedia-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-to-lead-company-1503881482" in September and is trying to shore up the company's finances ahead of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-uber-ceo-says-company-could-go-public-in-18-months-1504119090". In 2017, the company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-posts-fourth-quarter-loss-of-1-1-billion-on-higher-sales-1518572881" on sales of $7.36 billion.

In the past, Uber has left markets where it was struggling against local rivals. Last year, it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-merges-russian-arm-with-yandex-taxi-1499940002" with Yandex.Taxi, forming a joint venture with parent company Yandex in exchange for a stake of nearly 37%. In 2016, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-s-didi-chuxing-to-acquire-rival-uber-s-chinese-operations-1470024403" to Didi Chuxing Technology Co., receiving a 20% stake in Didi in exchange.

"https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-grab/", Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote: "It is fair to ask whether consolidation is now the strategy of the day, given this is the third deal of its kind, from China to Russia and now Southeast Asia. The answer is no."

"This transaction now puts us in a position to compete with real focus and weight in the core markets where we operate," he wrote, adding that Uber had invested some $700 million in the region.

Both Uber and Grab "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-battles-ride-sharing-startups-in-softbank-family-1520164801": Japan's SoftBank Group Corp., which in January "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-succeeds-in-tender-offer-for-large-stake-in-uber-1514483283" in Uber for $7.7 billion.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Uber and Grab had reached an agreement in principle.

A joint statement from the two companies said Grab will integrate Uber's ride-share and food delivery business in the region into Grab's existing transportation and mobile-payments platform. It also said Mr. Khosrowshahi will join Grab's board.

"Today's acquisition marks the beginning of a new era," Anthony Tan, group CEO and Grab co-founder said in a statement.

Stocks to watch: Hays, RBS, Shire, Purplebricks, Fresnillo

Here s what s happening

Smurfit Kappa was the top FTSE 100 faller after rejecting a sweetened takeover proposal from International Paper valued at  ¬36.90 a share, including  ¬24.605 a share in cash net of a dividend. The latest proposal was a 3 per cent increase on an initial offer from International Paper, whose shares dropped 15 per cent since that bid was submitted.

Aim-listed Purplebricks slipped on news that Axel Springer plans to buy an 11.5 per cent stake in the branchless estate agent, via a 100m share issue along with management disposals. The news came with a warning from Purplebricks that  some UK underlying softness and adverse weather in late February and early March has resulted in group revenues for the year being expected to be approximately 5 per cent below company consensus .

UBS repeated  sell  advice on Purplebricks, saying:  The recent weak UK performance is a concern given this market represents the most mature region for Purplebricks, and we believe provides question marks around the aggressive expansion Purplebricks are currently pursing. 

Shire edged higher following a reheat of takeover speculation among day traders. Takeda, the Japanese drugmaker, was the latest name being linked to the theory.

US-listed Finish Line was indicated 27 per cent higher in pre-market trading after JD Sports agreed to buy the footwear retailer for $558m cash, or $13.50 a share.

 The only potential competing bid we envision would be Foot Locker, which may have significant strategic incentive to block JD s entry to the US,  said Baird Equity Research, which called the purchase price  full . Sports Direct, Finish Line s 9.9 per cent shareholder, is unlikely to make an offer after the US group s management last year put in place a poison pill that blocks hostile takeovers, Baird said.

Sellside Stories

%Ï Canaccord Genuity raises Berkeley Group to  buy  as part of a bullish review of the housebuilding sector, which also starts coverage of MJ Gleeson with  buy  and a 795p target price.

 There is political support for more house building, and the land market remains supportive of sustainable margins. There is less scope for earnings upgrades and managing margins looks set to become more challenging, but assuming employment trends remain generally supportive with house prices holding up the sector looks well positioned to manage its challenges, and deliver strong margins and return on capital to support significant net asset growth and pay out attractive dividends.

 Balance sheets across the sector, in terms of land banks and leverage, remain strong and position the sector relatively well for any potential downturn. For investors who can overcome the UK macro anxieties and worries around the land banking review, we believe the sector offers attractive value after its recent pullback. 

%Ï Goldman Sachs upgrades Fresnillo to  buy  and added the gold miner to its  conviction list  as part of a sector review.

 Our commodities team is bullish on gold for the first time in more than five years based on higher inflation, rising emerging-markets wealth and concerns about an equity correction. While our economists are more bullish than Bloomberg consensus on expected 2018 Fed hikes (four versus three)   we believe gold could actually outperform once the tightening cycle is complete.

 Normally in a rising gold price environment we would recommend more leveraged names; however, with under-investment and the need to invest in replacement production, any excess cash flow is likely to go to higher capital expenditure. Because of this, we select stocks with a solid or growing production profile and low costs, where those with any excess free cash flow that can be returned to investors and grow dividends could be relative outperformers. 

%Ï HSBC upgrades both Smith & Nephew and ConvaTec to  buy  in a note on European medical technology companies.

HSBC said it had turned positive on S&N  as we see it as a key beneficiary in the sector from foreign exchange tailwinds and US tax-rate reduction . On ConvaTec it said:  With the company likely presenting new midterm targets in the second half 2018 and supply issues being resolved, we expect sentiment to rebound and the stock to re-rate from its low 16 times 2019 price-earnings level. We see this as a buying opportunity .

%Ï Deutsche Bank raises Royal Bank of Scotland to  buy  from  hold  with a 305p target price. A valuation of 8.8 times 2019 earnings provides an  attractive entry point  as RBS is among the most geared European bank to interest rates, which will rise sooner in the UK than in the EU, Deutsche said.

%Ï Redburn starts coverage of Hays with  buy  advice, saying the recruitment agent is  a cyclical stock offering structural growth  and high potential for capital returns.

A shrinking working-age population in Germany, along with the rise of automation and artificial intelligence,  will create a skills shortage on which Hays can capitalise , Redburn said.  As skills become harder to find, outsourcing the recruitment process to specialists will become the only option for employers. [ 	. 	. 	.] Hays has built a market-leading business in Germany tilted towards contracting and high-skilled candidates in growth industries. It is ideally positioned to capitalise on a once-in-a-lifetime workforce transition .

%Ï In brief: Credit Suisse raises Intu Properties to  neutral ; Sterling Energy cut to  add  at Peel Hunt; Sartorius cut to  hold  at Berenberg; AP Moller Maersk upgraded to  hold  at Berenberg; Citigroup resumes coverage of William Hill with  buy ;

China's ZhongAn in blockchain food-safety push

Insurance

An insurance company in China is looking to shake up the chicken supply chain   using blockchain technology.

ZhongAn Online Property & Casualty Insurance, launched in 2014 with the backing of Alibaba payments affiliate Ant Financial, Tencent and Ping An Insurance, quickly grabbed attention with peculiar products such as a "binge drinking" policy that paid out if Chinese fans got drunk during football matches and suffered alcohol poisoning.

The company's assets more than doubled in 2017 to Rmb21.2bn ($3.3bn), its annual report showed this week.

Last year the online-only insurer raised $1.5bn in a Hong Kong listing that was the world's first "insurtech" offering and attracted Japan's SoftBank as a cornerstone investor. Insurtech companies try to use technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain to simplify products and make them accessible.

Like many groups in China, ZhongAn has rapidly diversified. One of its latest projects, GoGo Chicken, targets the supply chain   a trial run before ZhongAn rolls out the technology to other applications. The company uses tracking devices and facial recognition technology to follow the movement of freerange chickens, from hatching to packaging, on hundreds of farms across China. Poultry are fitted with tracking devices on their legs and the data are logged using a blockchain ledger.

Customers can download an app on their smartphones to track a chicken's route to the supermarket and gain access to the bird's life history.

Using a blockchain record to track food in China could help address some of the perennial food safety problems, said Francis Tang, ZhongAn's chief financial officer. China has been repeatedly rocked by food product scandals. "They [the farmers] want to sell these free-range chickens at a higher price but a lot of people don't know if this is really a free-range chicken," Mr Tang said.

ZhongAn's technology "shows you where [a chicken] has been" and whether hormones or other harmful elements have been introduced", he added. Analysts have expressed scepticism about ZhongAn's insurance business. The company this week posted a net loss of about Rmb1bn for 2017.

Bank Indonesia Keeps Benchmark Repo Rate Unchanged at 4.25%

JAKARTA, Indonesia Indonesia's central bank kept interest rates unchanged Thursday, maintaining its support for economic growth despite recent downward pressure on the rupiah, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise U.S. rates.

Bank Indonesia left the benchmark 7-day reverse repo rate unchanged at 4.25%, where it has remained since a quarter-point cut in September.

"Bank Indonesia is of the view that the recent easing is still sufficient to help maintain the economic growth momentum," Bank Indonesia's spokesman said.

The decision was expected by all 11 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

The Fed's latest decision to raise rates and its projection for a total three increases this year were in line with Bank Indonesia's forecasts.

Following the Fed's move, the dollar weakened a touch to 13,735 rupiah from 13,761 rupiah before the decision.

While the Fed's rate increase prompted policy makers in China and Hong Kong to raise some of their rates, central banks in New Zealand, the Philippines and Taiwan chose to leave their policy unchanged.

Still, Moody's Analytics said it expects Bank Indonesia will start monetary tightening in the second half of this year.

Softness in the rupiah, which recently fell to its weakest level in two years, is seen as the biggest factor favoring a move by Bank Indonesia to follow the Fed. But the central bank looks determined to use its foreign reserves to support the currency for now rather than resort to higher interest rates that could cool growth.

The central bank currently holds $128.1 billion in foreign exchange reserves, compared with $105.3 billion in August 2015, when the rupiah fell close to 15,000 to the dollar. That gives it more fire power to prop up the rupiah if needed.

Meanwhile, raising borrowing costs is seen as difficult to do in the lead up to the 2019 parliamentary and presidential elections.

Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 5.07% in 2017, slightly more than the 5.02% in 2016, but a long way off the 7% average annual growth promised by President Joko Widodo, whose five-year term ends in October 2019.

Health-Care Firms Turn to Drugmaker Executives as Businesses Converge; Three recent high-profile hires underscore health-care companies' demand for leadership skills that span across the industry

Health-care companies are tapping executives from drugmakers as they seek out finance and other critical skills found outside their core business to help navigate a recent wave of consolidation.

A flurry of mergers is transforming -care as patients increasingly get their medical services outside of hospitals, in smaller venues including drugstores. CVS Corp. is acquiring Aetna Inc. for $79 billion. United Group Inc. announced plans for the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-to-buy-major-doctor-group-for-4-9-billion-from-davita-1512560700" of DaVita Inc.'s doctor group in December. And last month, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. made a takeover approach to drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp.

At the same time, these companies have made three high-profile executive hires from the pharmaceutical industry so far this month. CVS on Tuesday named Derica Rice, a former finance chief for drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co., to run its pharmacy benefit business. Walgreens appointed James Kehoe, formerly CFO of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., its new global finance chief. United named Andrew Witty, the former chief executive officer of drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC as the new CEO of its Optum -services businesses. All three begin their new positions within the next few weeks and months.

Deals that aim to integrate previously disparate businesses, as well as a push by Amazon.com Inc. to become a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-latest-ambition-to-be-a-major-hospital-supplier-1518517802" to U.S. hospitals and outpatient clinics, will stoke demand for executives with broad experience, recruiters and consultants said.

"To have a CFO or key executive who has a better understanding of how these businesses operate more holistically, it's an underlying indicator of some of these broader trends," said Per Hong, a partner at global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

Companies are looking for executives who can add outside expertise, in an effort to keep costs down while integrating, said Tim Dietlin, a partner at executive recruitment firm Heidrick & Struggles International Inc.

"This is a very nascent trend...the hope [is] that cross-pollination of talent and leadership will help inform the entire value chain and bring improvement to the industry," he said, adding that the health-care sector had been known for its insular hiring practices.

There has been a notable shift in the last two to three years, Mr. Dietlin said.

Mr. Rice worked at Lilly for about 27 years, serving as finance chief from 2006 until his retirement in December. He was interim CEO at the Indianapolis drugmaker for a few months in 2013 when then-CEO John Lechleiter took a medical leave.

He will join CVS next week as head of its pharmacy benefit management, or PBM business, which acts as health-care middleman and helps select which drugs are covered for insured patients and negotiates discounts with drugmakers.

"We selected Derica Rice as the new president of our CVS Caremark PBM business because he is a highly qualified executive with solid experience within the health-care sector," said a CVS spokeswoman. "We believe his expertise in the pharmaceutical sector will help us continue to effectively serve our PBM clients' needs while also developing and delivering innovative solutions and offerings that help us continue to evolve the business."

Mr. Witty, who will join UnitedHealth's Optum unit in July, retired from GlaxoSmithKline in 2016 after "https://www.wsj.com/articles/glaxosmithkline-says-andrew-witty-to-retire-as-ceo-1458199536" at the company.

Mr. Witty "brings more than three decades of health-care system strategic thinking and knowledge from around the globe, a record of fostering innovation and partnerships," said David Wichmann, chief executive of UnitedHealth in a statement. "Critically, he has deep experience with how data and analytics and new technologies can be used to improve patient outcomes, better serve consumers, lower costs and drive value across the system."

Meanwhile, at Walgreens, Mr. Kehoe brings his experience as finance chief of Takeda and the consumer goods industry, including Mondelez International Inc. and Kraft Foods Group Inc.

Walgreens and UnitedHealth declined to comment further.

The frenetic pace of deal-making in the health-care sector in recent months underscores the emerging sea change in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-medical-care-shifts-out-of-hospitals-companies-plan-deals-1513716507" There is a decline in hospital use under way sending companies scrambling to strengthen their position amid the shifting landscape.

"If you are changing the dynamic that much your executive team needs to understand the manufacturer side of the industry, the provider side of the industry and the insurer side of the industry," said Yogesh Bahl, a managing director of the life science practice at AlixPartners LLP, a global consulting firm.

China's Tencent Invests in Video, AI and Mobile Payments, as Earnings Soar; Tech titan indicates doubles down on mobile investments to ensure its presence on smartphones carried by nearly 800 million Chinese users

HONG KONG Tech titan "http://quotes.wsj.com/TCEHY"Ltd. indicated it was doubling down on investments in China's mobile-first world to ensure it remains a central presence on the smartphones carried by nearly 800 million Chinese users.

Tencent executives signaled they remained bullish on investments in video, artificial intelligence and mobile payments. "Many of the current achievements are really results from investments we made years ago," said Tencent President Martin Lau at a Wednesday press conference.

The plans emerged as the Shenzhen-based company said its fourth-quarter revenue grew 51% year over year to 66.4 billion yuan ($10.2 billion), boosted by strong growth in mobile payments, digital content subscriptions and advertising on its flagship mobile social apps, WeChat and QQ. Its earnings, meanwhile, nearly doubled from the same period a year ago to $3.2 billion.

The numbers reflected shifts in China's internet crowd. As of December, China had 772 million internet users, up 2.6% from the year before, with nearly 98% of those being mobile internet users, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. Mobile video users grew by 9.7% and mobile payment users grew by 12%.

While such trends helped gain Tencent's video arm 63 million paid subscribers, up from 43 million at the end of September, they signal a change of habit in one of Tencent's core profit drivers: videogame users. Tencent's active PC videogame users declined this quarter, in part due to migration to mobile games, but also because the company is beginning to be seen as the purveyor of China's casual games.

"Hardcore gamers rather spend their money on [competitor] Netease games or on overseas titles because Tencent's games are too simple for them," said Pacific Epoch analyst Benjamin Wu.

Tencent's Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell also acknowledged a tougher U.S. investing environment, noting that regulatory scrutiny of cross border investments has become "more severe in the last year."

"The U.S. is one market, and it's an important market," he said. "But there are many other markets, too."

But he added that many of the industries Tencent invests in aren't "a top concern to government."

The company also has boosted investment recently in so-called smart retail technologies designed to give consumers a more efficient shopping experience which is also a target of competitor Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Tencent Chief executive Pony Ma said on Wednesday the company has no intention of going into the retail business, but rather wants to help traditional brick-and-mortar stores integrate their online and offline services, to aid users and not have to use other platforms.

"I feel competition with Alibaba is healthy to development," Mr. Ma said. "The reason why mobile payment developed so rapidly in China is because of competition. So it's good."

Facebook is under increasing pressure from investors over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, with a number of shareholders putting their stakes in the social media network under review and others launching class action lawsuits against the world s biggest social network.

Investors are demanding answers from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg , who did not comment publicly until Wednesday on reports the UK data analytics company that worked for Donald Trump  s presidential campaign had improperly obtained data from 50m Facebook users.

Nordea Asset Management , the  ¬330bn Nordic investment house, has banned its sustainable funds from investing in Facebook in the wake of the scandal.  Given the mandate of the sustainability funds, we can no longer take on the risk in relation to this,  said Sasja Beslik, head of group sustainable finance.

Union Investment, the German asset manager, and a number of smaller investors are reviewing some of their holdings in Facebook .

Index provider MSCI and Sustainalytics, a rating company, said they were reassessing the environmental, social and governance scores they have awarded Facebook , in light of the revelations. These scores are often used by investors when deciding whether to invest in or sell a stock, meaning a downgrade by either could spark a further sell-off in the company.

A spokesperson for Facebook pointed to a statement by Paul Grewal, the company s deputy general counsel.  We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,  he said.

Cambridge Analytica said it deleted the data when it realised they were collected in contravention of Facebook  s terms of service and that none were used for its work with the Trump campaign. Facebook said it discovered the problem in 2015 and is now investigating whether the data were actually deleted.

But investors have been heavily critical of Facebook  s response to the scandal. Jonas Kron , senior vice-president at Trillium Asset Management, which owns about $12m of Facebook shares, said before Mr Zuckerberg s statement on Wednesday evening that it had been very concerning that the company had been sending relatively junior people to speak at Congress.

Mr Beslik has written to Facebook .  We are seeking clarification from the company and hopefully we will be able to meet them soon,  he said.  There are so many big questions they need to answer and there is so little information available. 

Natasha Lamb, managing partner at Arjuna Capital, an impact investing firm, said:  [The revelations are] fundamentally troubling from the investor perspective, not only because the company has been so recalcitrant in its response. There are material risks here in terms of regulator risk, revenue risk and brand risk. There are also risk to our democracy. 

Arjuna Capital has a proposal on the ballot at Facebook  s annual meeting later this year that will call for better policies on election interference, hate speech and dissemination of violence on the site.

Trillium Asset Management also has filed a proposal for Facebook to introduce a risk oversight board committee.

Stephen Beer, chief investment officer for the Methodist Central Finance Board, said the church held Facebook stocks through the funds in which it invests.  We will be talking to them about the recent news,  he said.

The technology company has also been hit by two class action suits in the US. One, brought by Facebook investor Fan Yuan, accused the social network of misleading shareholders by failing to disclose the problem earlier.

The other suit, by a Facebook customer called Lauren Price, alleges that the company has an  absolute disregard  for users  personal information and accused it of failing to stop the  improper  data collection. The suit includes Cambridge Analytica as a defendant.

Cambridge Analytica did not immediately return a request for comment on the lawsuit.

The actions filed on Tuesday add to the mounting legal woes for the social network, which is facing investigations in the US and Europe over the scandal.

The Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether Facebook violated a 2011 privacy settlement, while the attorneys-general in New York and Massachusetts have also opened investigations.

Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT s daily deals briefing

But first 	. 	. 	. 	Pete Peterson, the billionaire co-founder ofBlackstone, has died at the age of 91.Peterson had Lunch with the FT in 2007, just before theBlackstone IPO. Here is our obituary for a fuller picture of his life, which crossed politics and business.

Back to our normal programming 	. 	. 	. 	

The undisputed heavyweight champion among private equity firms isBlackstone,which manages well over $400bn in assets across every conceivable alternative investment strategy. ButApollo Globalhas mastered a trick that has even left the mightySteve Schwarzmanenvious.

Apollo, the firm founded byMichael Milkenacolytes, naturally has built its reputation on savvy credit investing. But perhaps more impressive ishow it has found assets to invest in debt securities.

Marc Rowan, an Apollo co-founder, in 2009 noticed the upheaval among life insurance companies whichhad been decimated by losses from the financial crisis. He createdAthene Holding, a vehicle to scoop up dislocated blocks of insurance policies.

Insurance premiums are typically invested in fixed income assets. So Athene could take insurance liabilities that were bought on the cheapand then use Apollo's credit expertise to generate outsized returns. (These liabilities were annuities where, once the promised return of a few percentage points was delivered to policyholders, the excess spread could be kept by the insurer.)

For Apollo, Athene created a source of permanent capital and a river of fees. Take a look below at how the firm's credit assets under management havesoared.

DD's Sujeet Indapexplores the whole host of Athene copycats that have emerged   includingBlackstone itself  after observing how profitable insurance has been for Apollo. Apollo's shares have doubled in the past two years as its fee income has exploded.You canread Sujeet's Inside Finance column.

The latest on China's CEFC

As China s largest private groups come under fire,  watch which companies buy up their assets , one senior state banker told the FT last year. The buyers are clearly the companies in favour with the leadership in Beijing, and probably alsowith Chinese PresidentXi Jinpinghimself, this person said.

With that in mind, the FT reports that China s largest state-controlled conglomerateCiticis in preliminary talks to take a stake inCEFC China Energy, the latest acquisitive private groupto come under pressure.

CEFC s chairmanYe Jianmingwas removed from his position three weeks ago and little information has been available on the future of the company until now. Ye is no ordinary businessman. After emerging from relative obscurity in 2014, his company last year agreed to take a $9bn stake in Russian oil giantRosneft.

Now the fate of that deal hangs in the balance, with the sellers of the stake  Swiss trading firmGlencoreand theQatar Investment Authority as well as Russian banksscrambling for more information. Several other deals that Ye struck in eastern Europe are also thought to have tipped over. Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg discussed the deal at the FT Commodities summit in Lausanne yesterday, as you can seefrom the tweetbelow.

Two weeks ago another state group,Huarong Asset Management, bought a stake in a subsidiary of CEFC. Huarong, which was created by theMinistry of Financein 1999 as a dumping ground for bad loans, has often swept in at the state s command to clean up corporate defaults.

The crackdown on CEFC has been swift. It s still unclear which state companies will take over the assets ofAnbang Insurance, the investment group that bought theWaldorf Astoriain 2014. Its chairman,Wu Xiaohui, was detained last June.

It's no surprise to see names like Citic and Huarong taking bites out of CEFC. The two companies are longstanding stalwarts of state business.

A Constellation bankruptcy

Private equity firms have found it tough to spend the $1tn plus of dry powder they have on hand.

So tough, it seems, thatConstellation Healthcare Technologieslooked like a good purchase for formerBlackstonedealmakerChinh Chuin his first deal after going solo. (Even after somedigging from Alphavillerevealed that former CEOPaul Parmarhad a long and colourful legal record.)

The company has filed for bankruptcy, with a twist:Constellation's former executives have been accused of fraud. Back when the company was listed on London's lightly regulated AIM markets, it went on an acquisition spree funded by secondary offerings.The restructuring officer said in a sworn document that theyfabricatedsome of thesecompanies, customers and revenue streams.

After the $309m go-private transaction   whichKPMGhelped audit  Constellation quickly ran into cashflow problems, for reasons that now seem obvious. The company either has sold or plans to sell the parts of its business that are actually operating (check the flow chart below):

Investigators believe some of the funds raised in UK public markets went to a firm calledSage Group Consulting, though they added they have "limited knowledge as to the facts and circumstances" of the payment. Court documents obtained by Alphaville show the firm agreed to lend Parmar more than $2m to help refinance his mortgage in 2012.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the company disclosed a grand-jury subpoena in its filing, and has hinted at an FBI investigation. Parmar denied allegations of fraud through his attorney. Find Alexandra Scaggs's full storyhere at FT Alphaville.

Chinese insurer ZhongAn plans blockchain chicken coup

An insurance company in China is looking to shake up the country s chicken supply chain   using blockchain technology.

ZhongAn Online Property & Casualty Insurance, launched in 2014 with the backing of Alibaba payments affiliate Ant Financial, Tencent and Ping An Insurance, quickly grabbed attention with peculiar products such as a  binge drinking  policy that paid out if Chinese fans got drunk during football matches and suffered alcohol poisoning.

The company s assets have ballooned since, more than doubling in 2017 to Rmb21.2bn ($3.3bn), its annual report showed this week.

Last year the online-only insurer raised $1.5bn in a Hong Kong listing that was the world s first  insurtech  public offering and attracted Japan s SoftBank as a cornerstone investor. Insurtech companies try to use technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain to simplify insurance products and make them more accessible.

Like many groups in China, ZhongAn has rapidly diversified away from its original business. One of its latest projects, GoGo Chicken, takes aim at China s chicken supply chain   a trial run before ZhongAn eventually rolls out the technology to other applications.

The company uses tracking devices and facial recognition technology to follow the movement of free-range chickens, from hatching to packaging, on hundreds of farms across China. Poultry are fitted with tracking devices on their legs and the data are logged using a blockchain ledger   an unalterable record that underlies cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Customers can download an application on to their smartphones that allows them to track a chicken s route to the supermarket, and provides access to the bird s life history along with charts showing its level of activity.

Using an incorruptible blockchain record to track the origin of food in China could help address some of the country s perennial food safety problems, said Francis Tang, ZhongAn s chief financial officer. China has been repeatedly rocked by scandals in which dangerous food products have made it on to supermarket shelves.

 They [the farmers] want to sell these free-range chickens at a higher price but a lot of people don t know if this is really a free-range chicken,  Mr Tang said.

ZhongAn s technology, said Mr Tang,  shows you exactly where it [a chicken] has been  and whether hormones or other harmful elements have been introduced along the way.

The company s foray into China s food supply chain underlines the nature of ZhongAn: it has always considered itself a tech company first and insurance group second.

Analysts have expressed scepticism about ZhongAn s insurance business. The company this week posted a net loss of about Rmb1bn for 2017, which management blamed on regulations requiring it to set aside reserves for a growing pool of longer-term products.

The company sold 5.3bn policies last year to 432m customers, roughly a third of China s population, solely via online distribution   an unheard of achievement for a traditional insurer. But to distribute its products the company is highly reliant on partnerships with other online companies, whose fees have eroded the thin margins on ZhongAn s low-cost policies

ZhongAn was also forced last year to refund about Rmb500m in investment products, Mr Tang disclosed, after Chinese regulators banned them as part of a crackdown last year on short-maturity, high-yield wealth management products.

CME pursuit of Nex reflects shift in US money markets

CME Group s potential purchase of the UK s Nex Group looks like a contrary move.

The world s largest exchanges operator s influence in Washington remains undimmed while it has retreated from London. International investors prefer to trade CME s Treasury futures, which track the prices of the US government debt, and eurodollar futures, which are a proxy for US interest rate moves, in Chicago.

Analysts forecast operating cost cuts of 30 per cent by matching CME s futures market with Nex s fixed income and foreign exchange businesses. But CME made $2.3bn in operating income last year, and hardly needs Nex, which likely to make operating profits of 145m in the year to March, to grow. A stronger rationale for this deal is the changing structure of US money markets.

Next month the US will begin publishing alternative reference rates for dollar Libor. US authorities are very keen for the derivatives market to adopt a new reference rate as some $45tn of futures and options business references dollar Libor. It is all traded at CME. Virtually all of it will mature by the end of 2021, when banks will be no longer compelled to submit to Libor.

The new benchmark, called Sofr, is based on the overnight Treasury repo market, which trades more than $700bn a day. The CME will be the first to offer futures and options on Sofr as it seeks to build the new market.

Among Nex s assets include US fixed income and repo trading venues that both trade on average more than $250bn a day and a data unit that supplies analytics on those markets.

Shifting away from Libor may also require more spring cleaning of banks  derivatives portfolios. This can be done by tearing up billions of dollars of old, fully-hedged, derivatives trades   a process known as compression. Nex owns the market leader.

A deal would strengthen CME s hegemony of US dollar-denominated trading assets as the Fed continues on the path of rate rises in the coming years. In past times this push into money markets might have angered the big investment banks, who feared the growing power of the CME. The Chicago exchange s bold stance shows how far their priorities have shifted.

Fink like a machine

FT BIG READ. THE FUTURE OF INVESTING BlackRock fired some of its fund managers last year and transferred the assets to its computer-powered investment unit on the west coast. It is betting that artificial intelligence can help it pick better stocks. By Robin Wigglesworth

L ast year, Larry Fink finally threw his lot in with the machines. On March 28, BlackRock unveiled a secret project codenamed "Monarch", a radical restructuring of its equities unit that is still reverberating across the industry.

The chief executive took an axe to BlackRock's underperforming stockpicking business, sacking seven fund managers and shifting billions of dollars they used to manage to a little-known arm of the asset manager's sprawling $6tn empire based in San Francisco, called Systematic Active Equities.

When BlackRock in 2009 swooped for Barclays Global Investors, the crown jewel was the iShares exchange-traded fund business, the biggest player in a growing industry that recently smashed past $5tn of assets under management. But some at BlackRock now reckon that the simultaneous acquisition of SAE, a $100bn computer-powered "quantitative" investment unit, could turn out to be an even bigger deal than the imperious iShares business.

"I firmly believe that, if we look back in five to 10 years from now, the thing that we most benefited from in the BGI acquisition is actually SAE," says Mark Wiseman, global head of active equities at BlackRock.

That may seem outlandish, given the success of iShares. But one of the biggest trends in the money management industry is the explosion of interest in quantitative investing, using high-powered computers and artificial intelligence to scour markets and gargantuan data sets for patterns that can be exploited by trading algorithms.

More importantly, BlackRock hopes that SAE will not only become its own "quant" powerhouse but also help transform its wider business by incubating new techniques and data sources that will be spread across its asset management complex.

The stakes are high. If Mr Wiseman succeeds in turning around BlackRock's underperforming equity unit he will put himself in a good position to succeed Mr Fink at the helm. And such is Black-Rock's heft that a successful quant revolution there will have an impact that is felt across the investment industry.

"It would be very aspirational for other firms if they pull it off," says Gary Chropuvka, a partner at Goldman Sachs Asset Management's quant arm. "As more people try to do this, the bar will probably go even higher for everyone, demanding and requiring even further innovation."

California dream BlackRock's San Francisco headquarters feels far away from Wall Street, both geographically and in spirit. An ecological co-working space and a medical cannabis dispensary are a stone's throw away from the asset manager's office on Howard Street. Even on February 5, when the US stock market suffered its biggest fall in six years, casually dressed SAE employees shuffled around unperturbed by the turmoil.

But this is where BlackRock's future might be forged. Mr Wiseman, who was poached from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to turn around Black-Rock's "active equities" business in 2016, wants SAE to be the company's Bell Labs, a reference to the research institute that traces its antecedents to Alexander Graham Bell.

"I think it's at the centre of what BlackRock does," Mr Wiseman says. "It'll be the place where we test new product and it will be the place that will continue to spawn things that are utilised more broadly for the whole firm." SAE is older than BlackRock, tracing its genesis back to an investment arm set up by Wells Fargo in 1971, which pioneered the index-tracking fund before Vanguard founder Jack Bogle turned the product into a markets-conquering phenomenon. By 1985 it launched a fund called Alpha Tilts which leaned on research that showed how investors could systematically beat indices by "tilting" towards certain stock characteristics, such as cheapness. Nikko Securities bought half of Wells Fargo Investment Advisors in 1989, before Barclays bought the outfit in 1995. The unit was long known as Scientific Active Equities, until a renaming last year.

SAE now employs 80 portfolio managers and researchers, who include more than 30 PhDs in computer science, physics and engineering. The goal is not to achieve dramatic wins but consistent market-beating results, according to Ron Kahn, head of research at SAE. "If we could deliver 1 per cent outperformance every year that would be nirvana," he says.

With increasingly efficient markets and an arms race between traditional and quantitative investors to be the first to spot even transitory opportunities, quants are faced with a constant challenge of finding research on new signals and data sets. Luckily, the amount of information that can now be collected, and the computing power needed to parse it, is now bigger than ever.

"This is one of the greatest opportunities in active management that I have ever seen," Mr Kahn says. "It is an explosion of data, technology and analytics and I have never seen anything like this before."

SAE's research process borrows from academia. An analyst proposes an investment idea, and is then assigned a "referee" who spends a week trying to demolish the thesis. It then gets presented to an approval board, which decides whether it should be included investment portfolios and what kind of weighting it should be given.

These days, the competitive advantage of such signals tends to be lost quite quickly, so SAE often gives a heavy weighting to new signals, and gradually reduces the money allocated as its effectiveness "decays".

A good example is Glassdoor, where employees can anonymously review their companies. Two decades ago investors might have looked at Fortune magazine's ranking of the happiest workplaces, but today SAE can systematically monitor for signs of a company's employees getting happier or restive.

That analysis has turned out to be a good predictor of stock returns.

This is just one of more than 1,000 signals that SAE has accumulated in its library, of which between 100 and 200 are currently being traded. Roughly a fifth of SAE's models are changed every year, with few signals working for much longer than five years.

"There is a lot of disruption going on in asset management," Mr Kahn says. "It may not be a great time to be a 50-year-old asset manager but it is a great time to be a 28-year-old with a lot of quantitative abilities."

Raffaele Savi, one of the co-heads of SAE, jokes that the difference between quants and traditional fund managers has historically been that the former are "one mile wide and one inch deep" and the latter are "one mile deep and one inch wide". In the theorist Isaiah Berlin's framework, quants are the foxes of markets, knowing a little about a lot of securities, while traditional investors are the hedgehogs, knowing a lot about one specific corner of markets.

But the new era of quant investing   evolving from simple signals that can be packaged into cheap exchange traded funds and into more research-intensive, complex strategies   could upset this.

"I think the big promise and opportunity of big data is that you can now build models that are one mile wide and a few feet deep," Mr Savi says.

Cultural difference There have been setbacks. In August 2007, almost everyone in the industry, including Goldman Sachs' Quantitative Investment Strategies division, took a beating from what became known as the "quant quake". But SAE's was particularly heavy. "It was all pretty ugly," recalls a fund manager who was there at the time. More recently, SAE funds had a poor 2016, when a host of its products underperformed their benchmarks after being wrongfooted by the turmoil of January and February that year.

But on a longer term perspective, the unit has performed well. Although SAE's assets under management are far below the $300bn high water mark of 2007, about 89 per cent of its assets have outperformed their benchmarks over the past three years, net of fees, according to BlackRock. Over the past five years it rises to 93 per cent, and even over the decade to 2017   which includes the quant quake   96 per cent have beaten their yardsticks.

Mr Shen argues that SAE's advantage over other quant investors is the expertise that BlackRock's traditional fund managers can also bring to the table. "We're certainly quite excited about how to augment humans with machines," he says.

Still, the bigger question is whether SAE can help turn round the wider equities unit. Although BlackRock executives stress that SAE stands on its own two feet, the hope is that resources ploughed into the quant arm will be a catalyst for the entire company. One example is the real-time economic gauges SAE has created for the Black-Rock Investment Institute, based on a host of alternative data sets like internet searches, online invoices and even traffic patterns. But the cross-unit pollination will need to be much broader and bigger to be judged successful.

Both inside and outside BlackRock there is some scepticism. "They're trying to catapult these groups together, but there are real cultural differences. And helping another group just takes your eyes off the ball," says one executive at a rival asset manager. One traditional BlackRock fund manager says that while some of SAE's data sets are useful, the "vast majority" are useless. "Most quant models are very short term, but I look three to four years out," he says.

To ensure that SAE's expertise is transmitted throughout the company, BlackRock last April poached Fidelity executive Doug Chow to head a new integration group that Mr Wiseman has dubbed "Middleware".

Mr Chow has already hired more than a dozen people, and hopes to have 30 in his team by 2019. He calls them "centaurs"   because of their hybrid quant-traditional investing roles   and plans to embed them into the broader BlackRock empire to develop new SAE-inspired data tools for its fund managers.

"One of the things I've learnt is that technology won't get adopted until you make the user interface so darn easy," Mr Chow says.

Michelangelo, but better The danger is that quantitative investing has grown too popular, too quickly. Virtually every investment group is now engaged in a race for talent and new data sets that can give them an edge. Sceptics say this will just lead to quants scouring the same data sets with the same tools and finding the same patterns.

But while the quant industry might be increasingly crowded, Mr Wiseman argues that traditional stockpickers are at risk of obsolescence. He is convinced that human fund managers can still hold their own against the onslaught of the machines   but only if they embrace a more hybrid approach.

He compares it to giving Michelangelo modern sculpturing tools like laser measurement tools and X-rays to detect flaws in the marble.

"I would argue that he could either produce something that would even be more remarkable and more beautiful than 'David' or he could produce 'David' more quickly," he says. "Those tools don't diminish his capabilities as a sculptor; quite the opposite; they would enhance his capabilities. So the fundamental investor has to learn to be Michelangelo in the common era."

'1% outperformance' Executives at Systematic Active Equities aim for consistent, market-beating results Innovation centre BlackRock hopes SAE will incubate the use of new data sources and techniques across the firm Quant time BlackRock head of active equities Mark Wiseman says managers need a hybrid approach to investing The third wave 'Everyone should have quant inputs' Stockpickers enjoyed a welcome renaissance last year, bouncing back from one of their worst spells in history with the best bout of performance since 2009. But the longer-term outlook still looks murky.

"The industry underestimates the magnitude of cost efficiencies needed to protect current industry profit margins," Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman warned last week.

Quantitative investors are not immune from pressures on fees and rising costs, but many in the industry are optimistic it will be able to supplant traditional investing approaches.

"We are in the third wave of quant," says Andrew Dyson, head of QMA, the $137bn quantitative investing arm of PGIM. "It mirrors the rising acceptance of technology in our lives, so having technology as part of your investment process feels natural now."

Quants time these waves differently, but most say the first era of the 1980s and 1990s was characterised by simple signals that are now largely commoditised through exchange traded funds, and "black box" strategies that many investors could never quite get comfortable with. The second era began in the 2000s, when there was a proliferation of computer-driven funds. That era ended in the "quant quake" of August 2007, when many funds suffered painful losses.

The current third era is driven by rising enthusiasm for the potential of artificial intelligence to sift through the sea of data for profitable signals. Even traditional funds hope the technology can help them turn round the post-crisis run of poor performance and investor outflows.

"Everyone should have quant inputs today," Mr Dyson argues. "If you're not incorporating that you're handicapping yourself against your rivals."

OakNorth becomes first UK digital bank to report annual profit

OakNorth has become the first of the UK s digital-focused challenger banks to report an annual profit, recording a pre-tax gain of 10.6m after its second full year of operations.

The bank, which specialises in lending to entrepreneurs and fast-growing businesses, generated net interest income of 24.9m in 2017, up from 7.2m the previous year, according to documents filed with Companies House this week.

It tripled the size of its loan book over the period, to 851.5m, while customer deposits more than doubled to 491m.

OakNorth is part of a wave of new lenders to spring up in the UK in the last few years, alongside groups such as Tandem, Atom and Revolut. Revolut said earlier this year that it had broken even on a monthly basis, but OakNorth is the first to report a full year of profit.

Rishi Khosla, OakNorth chief executive, told the Financial Times the figures were a  reflection of how we think and how we operate in terms of building businesses   we build them for profit and on strong foundations so as you grow you re scaling a real business rather than what happens to a lot of fintech where you just keep building for top-line or number of customers, but don t necessarily have the strongest business model .

The company has kept its cost base low through measures such as becoming the first British bank to operate all its core IT systems through the cloud, and hiring fewer staff than many rivals.

OakNorth Bank is part of a group that includes a  sister entity  focused on growing its fintech platform called Acorn; financial numbers for the wider group have not been published, but Mr Khosla said the difference in group profit was  marginal .

The lender s advisory board includes city grandee Adair Turner, former Conservative party chairman Francis Maude, and Nick Lee, the Bank of England s former head of new banks   appointments which were seen as a seal of approval for the challenger. Cyrus Ardalan, OakNorth chairman, said that with the latest results  we have demonstrated to the market that we are a disrupter that is here to stay .

The company said it was confident of achieving further domestic growth in the year ahead, despite rising competition for deposits and concerns about a potential economic slowdown.

It is also looking to expand internationally by licensing its technology to other banks, rather than building up its own balance sheet in multiple countries. The Acorn platform uses machine learning to speed up the process of lending to small and medium-sized businesses, and Mr Khosla said discussions with potential partners were  going really well .

He added that the majority of interest had come from established larger banks, and  the confidence that gives us in terms of the value of our proposition is very strong .

Banks

N26, the German online bank and a flagship start-up in the Berlin fintech sector, has raised $160m from a group of investors led by Tencent, the Chinese internet and social media group, and Allianz X, the insurance group's digital investment unit.

The funding round marks the latest vote of confidence in Berlin's technology sector, which has seen a flurry of big investments and stock market listings over the past year.

According to data released by EY yesterday, Berlin-based start-ups raised  ¬2.97bn in 2017, up from  ¬1.1bn the previous year. Among European tech hubs, only London was more successful, with start-ups based in the UK capital drawing  ¬4.88bn in investment last year. Valentin Stalf, co-founder and chief executive of N26, said the deal with Tencent and Allianz X was "one of the biggest funding rounds for a fintech in Europe and the biggest ever for a German fintech". He described the two new investors as "powerhouses in their respective fields of financial and internet services".

Mr Stalf said the company planned to use the latest investment to accelerate its expansion   N26 is due to launch in the UK and the US later this year   and to invest in product development. The company, which was awarded a German banking licence in 2016, has raised $215m to date. It has not revealed the size of the stake taken by outside investors, nor the overall valuation of N26. Founded in 2013, N26 is a digital retail bank that allows customers to conduct payments and other banking transactions through its mobile phone app. It has 850,000 customers in 17 European markets, and claims to sign up more than 2,000 new customers every day.

Unlike traditional retail banks, N26 operates no branch network, giving it a lower cost base than rivals. Despite the recent rapid growth, the company has just 380 employees.

N26 said in a statement yesterday that it planned to personalise its offering to clients further through the use of artificial intelligence, adding that AI "will allow the bank of the future to become more adaptive to customers' needs and solve the problems in a way that is currently missing among traditional retail banks".

Solmaz Altin, chief digital officer of the Allianz group, said in a statement: "N26 is a clear frontrunner in mobile banking. N26's banking platform is modernising traditional business models of financial services."

The German group contributed a quarter of the funding, investing about $40m, a person with knowledge of the matter told the Financial Times.

Lin Haifeng, managing partner at Tencent Investment, said: "We see the increasing demand of digital banking products and services in European markets and we are delighted to be a strategic investor of N26 to build a long-term partnership and participate in their growth."

How Google Is Racing to Shut Down Malicious Ads, a Growing Risk for Corporations

Malicious advertisements are a growing issue for companies whose online customers might be tricked into giving up credit card information or personal data.

Malicious ads can take many forms. A common type involves disguising the ad to make it look like a legitimate website, but directs people to a phishing site where they can be tricked into giving up sensitive information. Companies should be concerned about the rise of such ads, because they place their own reputations and customer base at risk. Companies should understand the scope of the threat and be prepared to work with tech platforms such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google to shut down problems.

Google -- the biggest player in the digital advertising market -- is using image recognition technology and artificial intelligence to detect and block a record number of malicious and deceptive ads, researchers at the company said.

E-commerce sites and digital publishers have been particularly concerned with how so-called malvertising affects their users and reputation, said Susan Bidel, senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc. New technologies and policies are the primary way companies in the digital advertising market can address emerging threats, such as ads embedded with cryptocurrency mining malware, she said.

"A lot of companies use Google to fill that white space with ad revenue, and they wouldn't want any kind of potentially negative user experience to affect how users view their site overall," said Ms. Bidel.

Machine learning algorithms that scan ads for signs of suspicious activity, such as embedded malware and code that collects credit card data on non-secure servers, helped Google block 3.2 billion ads in 2017, up from 1.7 billion in 2016 and 780 million in 2015, according to data released last week by the search and advertising giant.

Google's image recognition technology uses deep learning algorithms to classify shapes and text in photographs and recognize patterns that appear among malicious advertisements, said Shyam Sheth, a product manager at Google who leads its anti-malvertising efforts. AI allows Google to block an average of 100 bad advertisements per second.

"There's no human team that can possibly do that action so quickly," said Scott Spencer, a director of product management at Google who oversees a team of about 1,000 people working on these issues.

Google announced last week that starting in June it will "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-ban-ads-for-cryptocurrencies-1521000060" on its search and display advertising network. Scammers have capitalized on the rise in popularity of Bitcoin and other digital currencies by using online ads to promote fraud, according to Mr. Spencer. In recent months, hackers have embedded malicious software that surreptitiously drains a computer's power to mine for cryptocurrency into thousands of ads, WSJ Pro Cybersecurity reported.

Mobile advertising security presents a big challenge for Google.

Smartphones generally are harder to infect with malware than desktops and other devices because their operating systems are more secure and users update their mobile devices regularly, he said. As a result, scammers have focused on techniques that exploit user behavior instead of the device's code.

In one common mobile scam, ads redirect users to a fake app store or phishing site, where their personal information and credit card data can be stolen, said Mr. Sheth.

"Scammers and malicious actors are really good -- it's an arms race where they're constantly investing on their side and shifting their techniques," said Mr. Sheth.

Bank Indonesia Expected to Stand Pat on Rates; Moody's Analytics  expects the bank's monetary tightening to begin in the second half of 2018

JAKARTA Bank Indonesia is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday, even as expectation of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate increase has depreciated the local currency by about 2% to the greenback so far this year.

All of the 11 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect Bank Indonesia to keep the benchmark 7-day reverse repo unchanged at 4.25% for the sixth consecutive month.

Bank Indonesia has not raised borrowing costs recently to keep pace with the Fed's tightening, leading some economists to expect it to tighten by a quarter point later this year, if the pressure on the rupiah continues.

Moody's Analytics said it expects the bank's monetary tightening to begin in the second half of 2018.

Bank Indonesia has said it's policy bias is neutral following 200-basis points worth of easing in the past two years, citing rising inflationary pressure. Last week, Governor Agus Martowardojo indicated the bank won't rush to raise interest rates, while other central bank officials hinted the bank would continue to use its foreign exchange reserves to defend the rupiah.

Bank Indonesia currently holds $128.1 billion in foreign exchange reserves, compared with $105.3 billion in August 2015, when the rupiah fell close to 15,000 to the dollar.

Indonesia has been also able narrow its current-account deficit to 1.7% of gross domestic product last year from 2.1% in 2015.

Although the deficit is likely to widen again this year, investors are unlikely to punish Indonesia as the widening is being attributed to rising investment boosting imports of capital goods.

Rising foreign direct investment is also expected to mitigate the damage of the widening current-account deficit on the nation's balance of payment.

"The current rupiah's exchange rate doesn't reflect the fundamentals of Indonesia's economy. Therefore, after the market players are well-informed regarding the dot plot and path of the U.S. interest rate outlook this year, the pressures on the rupiah along with other emerging market currencies will be easing," said Josua Pardede, an economist with Bank Permata.

"The current rupiah's level isn't worrying yet," said Bank Mandiri's chief economist Anton Gunawan.

The rupiah on Wednesday morning traded at 13,760 to the dollar.

Uber Suspends Driverless-Car Program After Pedestrian Is Killed; Accident in Tempe, Ariz., is believed to be the first such fatality from an autonomous vehicle

By Greg Bensinger and Tim Higgins

An Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona in the first known fatality involving an autonomous vehicle, an accident that could stir regulators to action and damage the public perception of the young industry.

In response, Uber on Monday temporarily pulled its self-driving cars off the roads where it has been testing them in four cities. An Uber spokeswoman said the company is investigating the incident and cooperating with authorities.

Police in Tempe, Ariz., said the Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with a human safety operator at the wheel when it hit 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg on Sunday night while she was walking her bicycle outside of a crosswalk. The woman later died from her injuries, according to a police statement.

While it isn't clear yet whether Uber's vehicle was at fault in the accident, the fatality confirmed the fears of those who have warned for several years that someone would eventually die from driverless cars. Tempe Police at a news conference Monday said the vehicle was traveling nearly 40 mph at the time of the accident in a 35 mile-per-hour zone and didn't initially show any signs of slowing; the Uber operator in the car wasn't impaired, they said.

Auto makers and technology giants have braced for this inevitability but contend that the technology will ultimately save thousands of lives by eliminating human error.

The biggest auto makers, including General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., along with a slew of technology giants such as Uber and Alphabet Inc., are collectively spending billions of dollars in their historic pursuit to replace the human driver with essentially a computer on wheels. While they tout the safety benefits, the introduction also holds promise of upending the automotive business and potentially crowning new transportation giants.

Uber has called its self-driving efforts "existential" and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-reaches-settlement-with-waymo-over-trade-secrets-1518192710" from rival Alphabet's self-driving unit, Waymo, over allegedly stolen trade secrets; Uber denied the claims. Uber, which has logged 3 million test miles, has been racing to keep up with Waymo, which has conducted more than 5 million miles on public roads and billions more in computer simulation.

The accident comes at a pivotal time for the industry. Mainstream car makers are already incorporating semiautonomous systems in their vehicles that allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel for periods of time. Waymo, which has been testing vehicles in the Phoenix metro area without humans behind the wheel, plans to begin commercial robot taxi services there this year.

The fully-autonomous technology is still unproven, yet federal and state regulators have allowed these companies to test the robot cars on public roads. More than 50 companies are licensed in California alone to test self-driving vehicles there, as long as they have human operators in the car.

Both the National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said they were dispatching teams to Tempe to investigate the accident. NHTSA said it was in contact with Uber, state and local authorities as well as Volvo, the car maker Uber relies on for its self-driving vehicles.

Volvo, a unit of China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., said in a statement: "We are aware of this incident and our thoughts are with the family of the woman involved."

Industry observers pointed to the fatal accident as evidence that the nascent technology needs more time to be fully developed before being deployed on public roads. 

Missy Cummings, a professor of mechanical engineering and material science at Duke University, cautioned Congress in 2016 about companies rushing to put systems into widespread deployment and warned that a death could set back development of the potentially lifesaving technology.

"There is no question that someone is going to die in this technology," she said to Congress in 2016. "The question is when and what can we do to minimize that?"

On Monday, Ms. Cummings repeated that message, saying, "It is a day that we knew would come."

Regulations vary widely by state and are murky at the federal level. It isn't clear the public is willing to surrender control to a computer, and unexpected safety issues could arise in tricky environments.

Congress has been considering legislation to clear up regulatory questions about autonomous-vehicle deployment. The legislation appeared to be moving quickly until stalling in the Senate this year under concerns about the safety of the technology.

Sen. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.) reiterated his calls to Congress to enact a federal law that would ensure certain safety and privacy protections are in place before they are tested on public roads. The Consumers Union called the death a reminder "of the risk that comes with rushing to get more and more self-driving cars on public roads before we know they are safe."

Developers of self-driving technology have argued they can only ensure the vehicles are safe by testing them in real world situations. 

Tesla Inc. became the first auto maker to come under significant government scrutiny for a semiautonomous driving system when a man driving one of its Model S electric cars operating with the company's Autopilot system "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-draws-scrutiny-from-regulators-after-autopilot-feature-is-linked-to-a-death-1467319355" with a truck on a Florida highway.

Ultimately, NHTSA concluded Tesla's technology "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulators-to-close-tesla-autopilot-probe-1484845021" while the NTSB decided that the company shared blame in the crash by failing to include enough safeguards.

Tesla has said Autopilot significantly makes its vehicles safer and that the company would continue to evaluate recommendations as the technology evolves while ensuring drivers understand the system doesn't render cars fully self-driving.

According to government figures, 94% of crashes involve human error. The number of lives lost on U.S. roads surged nearly 6% to 37,461 in 2016, according to the most recent government data. A recent nonprofit study found motor-vehicle deaths remained near decade-high levels in 2017.

U.S. highway safety regulators, in the absence of codified rules, are working on updating guidance for autonomous vehicles that began under the Obama administration. The Trump administration has taken pains to emphasize that it is voluntary for companies to submit safety assessment letters to regulators that the guidance suggests are advisable.

Regulators maintain a role overseeing safety of automated driving systems, but they are "not going to be top-down, we are not going to be command and control, we're tech neutral," said Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao during a January stop in Detroit at the city's annual auto show. She put the onus on auto makers and Silicon Valley firms to persuade consumers that driverless-car systems are safe lest motorists lose confidence in them, which could hinder companies' technology development and growth.

While robot cars are being created to follow traffic rules, interactions with humans continue to present hurdles. Pedestrians, in particular, can confuse systems because they are unpredictable.

Even human drivers struggle to deal with pedestrians. About 50% of pedestrian fatalities involve people running into the road, failing to yield the right of way or otherwise crossing improperly, according to research by Duke's Ms. Cummings. The Governors Highway Safety Association estimates nearly 6,000 pedestrians were killed in the U.S. last year, representing about 16% of all motor-vehicle deaths.

Autonomous cars often use a complicated fusion of data coming from cameras, radar and laser sensors used by artificial intelligence to identify other cars, pedestrians and obstacles.

"The computer vision systems are incredibly brittle in these cars," which could pose problems in detecting pedestrians, Ms. Cummings said Monday.

For example, the 2016 Tesla crash involved the Model S hitting a truck that was crossing the road. The company said its car's system couldn't see the truck's white trailer against a bright sky. It isn't clear if Uber's laser senors failed to detect the pedestrian.

This is the second crash in Tempe, a city of about 180,000 that is home to Arizona State University, to rock Uber's autonomous-car program in the past year. Almost exactly a year ago, Uber "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-suspends-self-driving-vehicle-program-after-accident-1490468860" after one of its Volvo SUVs collided with another in an intersection, flipping the Uber vehicle on its side. No one was seriously injured, and police determined the Uber vehicle wasn't at fault. The company resumed operations in three days.

Uber began testing the autonomous vehicles in Tempe last year after California regulators revoked the cars' registrations because the startup failed to get a permit to operate them there. Uber has since paid $150 to get a permit in California, where it is testing them without customer passengers. It has also been testing in Pittsburgh since September 2016, and last year it put autonomous vehicles in Toronto.

The financing will help the company expand its products for capital markets and wealth management and work on technology in areas including speech analytics.

* "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spy-software-gets-a-second-life-on-wall-street-1438541720"

Barclays PLC and Square Capital participated in the financing, as did previous investors Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Nasdaq, Lemhi Ventures, HCA Healthcare Inc. and the Partnership Fund for New York City.

Angel Rodriguez-Issa, who is global head of strategic investments, global markets at BNP Paribas, has joined Digital Reasoning's board.

In 2016, Nasdaq and Digital Reasoning announced an alliance to provide surveillance technology for capital markets, including buy-side, brokers, regulators and exchanges. Lemhi and Nasdaq led a $40 million Series D round for Digital Reasoning in 2016.

When the partnership was announced, Nasdaq and Digital Reasoning said a "holistic surveillance" effort comparing the comments and trading activity of traders was intended to improve upon existing technology at the time. For example, keyword searches didn't account for the context of a word like "tank."

Barclays  board has declared there is still more work to do to improve controls and compliance at the British bank, while calling on senior managers to try harder to hold individuals to account when they fall short.

Since being fined billions of pounds in recent years for attempting to manipulate interest rate and foreign exchange markets, Barclays has been told by regulators to tighten up its oversight and monitoring of employees to snuff out further misconduct.

The bank has been hiring a significant number of people to bulk up its internal policing team, including new heads of internal audit for its main UK and international divisions, as requested by regulators after a recent review of this area.

The Barclays audit committee  observed that the issues arising from unsatisfactory audits indicated that there was still work to do in embedding the required level of control consciousness across the group and ensuring that control exceptions were highlighted clearly in management reporting , the bank said in itsannual report last month.

The committee also  challenged the application of the lessons learned process in view of the low level of coverage of significant control incidents . It added:  Management has taken steps to enhance the process and ensure compliance. 

It said the committee had  requested that senior management support BIA [Barclays internal audit] in holding individuals accountable for failure to remediate risks effectively where they had failed BIA validation .

A Barclays spokesman said the audit committee was merely doing its job by scrutinising the bank s internal controls and it was not particularly concerned about the area. But the language of the Barclays audit committee is much tougher than in rivals  annual reports.

Since being fined $2.4bn for attempted forex rigging and $450m for trying to manipulate the Libor interest rate benchmark, the bank has launched a number of initiatives to clean up its act. The audit committee said its efforts were producing a  positive change  and it was  on track to meet its milestones  in the remediation plan it agreed with US and UK regulators.

However, Barclays still faces litigation over several areas of potential wrongdoing. The US Department of Justice issuing the bank over accusations that it mis-sold billions of dollars of subprime mortgage securities before the financial crisis, while the bank and several former senior executives facecriminal charges in the UK over the terms of a fundraising from Qatar.

Barclays has rejected the DoJ s claim and said it would vigorously defend the complaint. The bank has also said it intends to defend the charges related to the Qatar fundraising.

Furthermore, British and US regulators are investigatingJes Staley, the bank s chief executive, over his attempts to uncover the identity of a whistleblower in 2016.Barclays has said that Mr Staley s attempts to identify a whistleblower were  honest but mistaken .

Since that incident, Barclays has been training staff on how to blow the whistle and managers on how to handle these incidents. It also surveyed staff on whether they feel able to speak up about dishonest or unethical behaviour and  monitored instances of retaliations reports and whether any instances have been substantiated .

There have been severalhigh level exits from Barclays  compliance team in recent months. Michael Roemer, its head of compliance, and Jonathan Cox, its head of whistleblowing, both left in October. Troels Oerting, its head of security, took a leave of absence last year.

TheBank of England sPrudential Regulation Authority has called on Barclays to improve its internal audit function, focusing on  its independence and impact, quality and weight of resources and productivity and methodology .

The Barclays audit committee reviewed several  material control issues and associated remediation plans  last year, including  model risk, resilience, cyber, compliance, technology, credit risk transaction operations and data management .

Barclays last year appointed Deloitte to carry out a review of its internal audit function   something it has to do every five years. The bank said the review concluded that  the focus on increased headcount in BIA will help drive audit capacity and capability .

The audit committee said it was  satisfied with the conclusions of the report, while noting the potential development areas identified, in particular, extending the use of data-analytics .

The sovereign-wealth funds of China and Ireland have launched a  ¬150 million ($185 million) fund to invest in technology companies.

The venture is a collaboration between one of the world's largest state-backed investors and a relative minnow. China Capital Corp., which is backing the fund through its CIC Capital direct investing arm, oversees $200 billion, according to its website. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, or ISIF, is a  ¬8 billion fund backed by the country's National Treasury Management Agency.

The fund will invest in Chinese technology companies interested in entering the European market and Irish companies eager to expand into China, ISIF said in a statement. The vehicle, which will target deals in sectors including the Internet of Things, big data, robotics and artificial intelligence, is the successor to the $100 million China Ireland Technology Growth Fund, which was launched in 2014.

That fund is now fully invested after investing in six Irish firms, including chip developer Movidius Ltd., which was sold to technology company Intel Corp. in 2016, the release said.

Like its predecessor, the new fund will be run by Dublin-based fund manager Atlantic Bridge and Beijing-based WestSummit Capital, ISIF said, adding that the two firms will offer local networks for the portfolio companies.

ISIF, which spent  ¬17 billion to bail Irish banks between 2009 and 2011, was rebranded from National Pension Reserve Fund in 2014. It has provided capital to a number of funds, including  ¬125 million to Carlyle Group LP's lower midmarket buyout fund and  ¬25 million to Motive Partners, the specialist technology private-equity investor, according to its website.

In 2015 the fund manager partnered with KKR & Co.'s credit arm to launch Activate Capital, a new real-estate lender that it said would provide  ¬500 million for Irish residential development projects, Private Equity News previously reported.

CIC also invests in private equity through CIC International, its dedicated overseas-investment division. It recently completed the  ¬12.3 billion acquisition of European logistics company, Logicor Ltd., from private-equity giant Blackstone Group LP, CIC said in December.

Big Issues: Personal Finance (A Special Report) --- Will There Be a Need for Credit Cards in Five Years?

An evolution is under way in the global payment system. Advances in mobile phones and internet technology are giving rise to apps and other digital platforms that allow people to pay for goods and services with their smartphones instead of with cash or traditional credit and debit cards.

How quickly U.S. consumers adopt these technologies -- and whether they ditch the plastic as a result -- remains to be seen.

A survey by Accenture Consulting found that while 56% of U.S. consumers are aware of technologies that allow them to use their smartphones to pay, less than 25% regularly do it. Still, the survey suggests adoption is poised to rise.

Some experts say reports of the credit card's death have been greatly exaggerated. Cards aren't going away soon, they say, and neither is the credit-card account, which consumers value and are comfortable using. Others say credit cards won't be needed in five years because mobile payments are more convenient, cheaper and more secure.

YES:

They Still Offer

Services That New

Platforms Don't

----

By Tom Miller Jr.

Are credit cards going away in five years in favor of new payment technologies or new ways to transfer funds? Not likely. For most Americans, plastic credit cards are an example of "low tech, good tech."

Mobile wallets and other forms of digital payments compete with plastic credit cards, but adoption rates in the U.S. have been relatively slow, with 45% of respondents in a recent survey saying it's just easier to pay with a card. Consumers aren't clamoring for a way to stop using credit cards because they aren't bulky, there is no battery to charge and they can survive drops and exposure to water. They also can be given to family members to use or their numbers can be read over the phone.

A millennial colleague recently opined that the future will likely bring a smaller chip-carrying form. She's right: Visa has tested a payment ring. Fingerprint or retina technology might ultimately become the "chip" used by many consumers. These technologies might end up being superior to what we have now in terms of security and convenience.

But no matter what form the credit card of the future takes, demand for credit-card accounts will endure far longer than five years.

The ability to buy goods and services anytime and anywhere, coupled with the flexibility to pay for those purchases over time, is what makes credit cards so attractive to consumers. Once a luxury reserved for the wealthy, access to credit via a credit card is now available to consumers across many demographics.

Americans' commitment to credit cards is strong, even among the millennial generation. My consumer-finance students talk about cellphone apps that facilitate fund transfers, yet most of them also have a credit card -- as do three-quarters of U.S. consumers, according to a 2015 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston survey. Some 44% of U.S. families carry balances month to month, and among families that do maintain this kind of debt, the average balance is roughly $5,700, according to a survey from the Fed's Board of Governors.

Internet technology has given rise to new online payment networks and lending platforms that some say will reduce transaction costs and the cost of supplying unsecured credit to borrowers. While these platforms benefit some businesses and consumers, they aren't a complete substitute for credit cards. Subprime borrowers might not have access to new lending platforms. All consumers benefit from credit-card features, including the freedom to access credit instantly without having to get outside approval each time, the option to carry a balance, protection from disputed charges and the variety of rewards programs.

Airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars are easy to reserve with a credit card. It is also easy to channel daily living expenses through credit cards to earn airline miles or cash-back bonuses. For the people who use credit cards this way, and for many others, not having one seems almost unimaginable.

Electronic Payments

Are Safer, Easier to

Use and Cheaper

----

By Cristian deRitis

Credit cards have played a vital role in our economy, but the need for them will fade away in the next five years. Electronic payments are more convenient, cheaper and more secure, and adoption of these technologies is going to accelerate as a result.

The credit cards of today perform two key functions. They facilitate commerce by allowing consumers and businesses to quickly and easily pay for goods and services. They also are the primary method for delivering unsecured credit to consumers. The economy will still need a system to perform these roles, but credit cards won't have to be that system.

Given high barriers to entry and large economies of scale, only a few credit-card networks exist, leading to relatively high transaction fees of 1% to 4% on every purchase. Mobile phones and the internet are quickly disrupting this model as the cost of establishing a new, online payment network plummets.

Consumers can now make payments with text messages and online services, bypassing the proprietary networks of the credit-card processors. Smartphone applications such as Apple Pay and Google Pay are also bringing down transaction costs by incorporating biometric security, geolocation technology and other tools that can sharply decrease fraudulent transactions relative to physical cards.

While credit cards won't be needed in five years, some people will still want to use them, just as some people still prefer paper checks even though better alternatives exist. Still, there are signs the momentum is shifting.

Millennials are adopting services such as Venmo and PayPal at fast rates, and survey data suggest that nearly 40% of smartphone users have at least one payment app.

Meanwhile, generational attitudes toward credit cards are rapidly shifting. Younger millennials don't have the same affinity for credit cards as their parents, partly due to a 2009 law that makes it difficult for borrowers under age 21 to get a credit card without a cosigner. Many of them will bypass cards altogether as digital-payment options expand.

Having an unsecured line of credit for emergencies and to smooth out fluctuations in income and savings is what many people value about credit cards. But this flexibility comes at a cost. Credit-card interest rates are high due to the default risk posed by borrowers.

Here again, internet technologies are giving rise to services that can fulfill this role, but at a cheaper cost. Online lending platforms such as LendingClub and Prosper connect individual borrowers with a wider range of potential lenders, reducing the interest rates some borrowers face to consolidate existing debts or finance new purchases.

The next generation of consumer lending may include more "sale-based" financing, where lenders use real-time spending and income data to price default risk on a purchase-by-purchase basis.

Consumers will still demand and need sources of unsecured credit. They just won't need to carry around slips of plastic to get it.

Pharmaceutical companies and venture capitalists alike have many choices today when it comes to selecting a startup using artificial intelligence to accelerate drug delivery.

SoftBank Ventures, the early-stage investment arm of SoftBank Group, settled on twoXAR Inc. for its potential scalability. The firm is leading a $10 million Series A in the company, along with previous backers Andreessen Horowitz and new investor OS Fund.

The financing, which is planned for hiring more employees, brings the company's total raised to date to $14.3 million.

While similar companies may use a combination of computer science and physical lab experiments, twoXAR software aims to take an all-encompassing approach to drug discovery. The platform screens large data sets of existing compounds and diseases for potential new targets, and looks for clues to create entirely new compounds.

SoftBank Ventures Managing Director Joonpyo Lee said the methodology will translate to quick growth for twoXAR. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company, founded in 2014, works with pharmaceutical companies and is developing its own drug pipeline.

Kenya's 4G Capital plans crypto bond

Capital markets

4G Capital, a Nairobi-based microfinance and training company, is to become the first such financial institution to issue a tokenised bond using cryptocurrencies.

The initial issuance aims to reach about $10m and a targeted coupon of 10 per cent to prove the concept, according to Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 4G's founder and chief executive. It will be offered next month to the company's existing institutional and qualified investors, who can pay in either bitcoin or ether.

It highlights the rapidly growing enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in Kenya, which has been in the vanguard of digital financial innovation since Safaricom, the country's dominant mobile telecom company, launched the Mpesa mobile money platform in 2007.

Last year the government and central bank launched M-Akiba, the world's first government bond to be sold only via mobile money platforms.

Kenyans' holdings of cryptocurrencies represented 2.3 per cent of the country's $74bn gross domestic product in December, according to Citibank   the fifth highest in the world.

The 4G Capital cryptocurrency tokens will be issued on a platform run by Finhaven, a Canadian technology company. Returns will be paid monthly in either cryptocurrencies or US dollars.

Finhaven claimed investors would be given the same protection as if investing in a normal bond, even though the structure is largely unproven.

Mr Hennessy-Barrett said the issuance was partly driven by the high cost of capital in Kenya. Banks are reluctant to lend because of a law that caps lending and borrowing rates, while bonds are even more expensive.

"There's a big gap in the market for small African businesses to raise working capital," Mr Hennessy-Barrett said. Weekly cryptocurrency transactions in Kenya have grown from nothing to Ks150m ($1.5m) in less than four years according to Michael Kimani, chairman of the Blockchain Association of Kenya.

"What cryptocurrencies are doing is acting as a bridge to new sources of funding, to elsewhere in the world where there is more capital," he said, adding that 4G Capital's bond was "the most logical use of cryptocurrencies".

But, in contrast to Mpesa and M-Akiba, the Central Bank of Kenya has taken the most cautious approach to cryptocurrencies of any African regulator   it is the only one that has banned banks from letting people use accounts to trade such products.

Patrick Njoroge, central bank governor, has said "blockchain technology is something that can be useful" but warned against cryptocurrencies. "If you want to invest in those things, know that it is a bubble of a kind," he said. "Be ready to lose all your money."

But as the data indicate, many Kenyans are ignoring Mr Njoroge and circumventing the banking restrictions. The central bank's approach "doesn't help the industry but parks it under the table", according to Elizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of Bitpesa, a blockchain payments platform that facilitates $20m of transactions a month. It was established in Nairobi in 2013 and has operations in eight African and several European countries. It is now headquartered in Luxembourg, partly because of the Kenyan restrictions. "It's a shame because there's a huge developer community growing in Kenya and they're not allowed to have accounts," she said.

The authorities' approach might change soon as the government has created a task force to explore distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence and gave it three months to produce a road map for their adoption.

Dimon rues Bear Stearns' costly legacy

Banks. Litigation bill JPMorgan's chief appeared to have pulled off a coup in 2008, but costs soon mounted

The takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase, sealed exactly a decade ago in the crucible of the 2008 financial crisis, was one of the signature deals of a turbulent year, and the knockdown price of $2 a share was a shock to Wall Street.

Even after the terms were raised to $10 a share, JPMorgan and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, appeared to have pulled off a coup. Acting at the urging of the US government, which feared the fallout from Bear's failure, JPMorgan had obtained a prestigious Wall Street franchise   plus a stately octagonal tower on Madison Avenue   for about $1.2bn, a fraction of Bear's $11bn in common equity.

Ten years on, JPMorgan is comfortably the biggest bank by assets in the US and has market-leading businesses all across the investment bank, some of them boosted by Bear. Mr Dimon, too, has grown into a role as elder statesman of the industry, reminding investors last month that his crisis-era acquisitions saved thousands of jobs and "avoid[ed] the devastation of communities".

Yet the full cost of the deal to JPMorgan probably outweighed the benefits. By the time of his letter to shareholders in 2012, Mr Dimon was already complaining about the "poor" systems he inherited from Bear, as well as a big pile-up of litigation connected to missold mortgages. In 2015, he lamented that the cost of settling lawsuits was pushing $19bn, about 70 per cent of which was connected to Bear and Washington Mutual, another distressed asset JPMorgan picked up in 2008. "We did not anticipate that we would have to pay the penalties we ultimately were required to pay," Mr Dimon wrote.

Bear hit trouble because it had loaded up on mortgage-related assets in what seemed to be an ever-rising housing market. When prices began to fall and loans went bad, creditors panicked and demanded their money back.

JPMorgan initially stepped in with emergency funds to Bear on Friday, March 14. But over that weekend, the US Treasury strong-armed Mr Dimon into buying the whole thing.

Bear was the smallest and most highly leveraged of the top firms on Wall Street, but rivals such as Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers were also showing signs of distress. The government feared carnage in Asian markets on the Monday if Bear was allowed to fail. At the same time, the Treasury wanted to send out a signal, according to people in the room at the time: if a bank got into trouble and the government came in to help, its shareholders would suffer.

The US Treasury declined to comment, as did Neel Kashkari, the former Treasury official who handled negotiations on the ground. He is now president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve.

Mr Dimon had big plans for Bear at the outset. In his 2009 shareholder letter he noted mounting losses on the bank's $370bn of assets but said that, in time, the acquisition should add $1bn to JPMorgan's annual earnings.

He said he was particularly pleased to bulk up in energy trading and also prime broking   a business within investment banks that acts like a concierge to hedge funds, supplying them with everything from loans and research to introductions to investors. Bear was dominant in both and JPMorgan remains a leader in prime broking. It sold out of physical commodities in 2014, however, with a $3.5bn sale of the business to Mercuria.

Bear also gave a leg-up to JPMorgan's equities business, through characters such as David Freedman, who runs merger arbitrage, and Nick Rosato, head of North American research. Institutional Investor magazine ranked Bear's research as the second best on Wall Street in 2007, two notches ahead of JPMorgan. Now JPMorgan is number one in the survey.

Still, many of Bear's big hitters, especially in bond trading, scattered almost instantly. Today, there are no ex-Bear people on JPMorgan's 11-member operating committee, or among the five corporate officers. According to one estimate, less than 4,000 of 14,000 Bear employees at the time of the deal were still at JPMorgan within a couple of years. These days, about 2,000 remain.

Mr Dimon had done his best to smooth things over with Bear's shellshocked employees. But during a first meeting at Bear's headquarters on a rainy Wednesday following the deal, he was barracked by senior managing directors, according to several people who were there. When he made an analogy to a "shotgun wedding" one trader fired back that it felt more like a "rape".

All had been hurt by the collapse of the share price. Employees owned about one-third of Bear's stock, often accumulated during long careers at the company, and at much higher prices than $2 a share, or even $10. A year earlier the stock had been at $170.

"I thought I'd be working until I was 100-years-old," says John Fitzgerald, who ran an expert-network business within Bear's equity unit.

This was a tight-knit group, says Michael Kiernan, who used to run the morning call on Bear's equities floor, when analysts presented to the bank's sales force. As the company began to splinter he used his connections to maintain a giant Excel spreadsheet, hoping to link people to job opportunities elsewhere. He hosted a networking event at the Public House bar on East 41st Street that first Thursday; 10 years on, he says, "hundreds" still show up to yearly reunions.

"It was a scrappy firm with good culture," says one former top executive. "We always viewed ourselves as the kids from the wrong side of the block."

JPMorgan's 2017 annual report, filed a fortnight ago, still shows a handful of outstanding litigation proceedings connected to Bear. Given the already huge bill for litigation, it seems unlikely that any other big bank will come to the aid of the government in the next financial crisis, says Rodgin Cohen, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell who acted for Bear's board on the sale.

JPMorgan's $13bn settlement with the Department of Justice over sales of mortgage-backed securities in 2013, in particular, appeared to involve an "unreasonable" component for Bear's misdeeds, says Mr Cohen.

Mr Dimon, meanwhile, was still bitter in his 2015 letter to shareholders. "In case you were wondering: No, we would not do something like Bear Stearns again," he wrote. "In fact, I don't think our board would let me take the call."

Pricing structure Skyscraper value estimated at $1.7bn A day after the board of Bear Stearns agreed a sale to JPMorgan Chase, some wag taped a $2 bill on the front door of the company's headquarters.

Bear did not own that building at 383 Madison Avenue, a 43-floor tower in the old financial heart of Manhattan. But it did have a right to buy the skyscraper at the end of its lease in 2012, provided it paid off the associated debt of the lessor.

According to Bear's last annual report, that option was worth a maximum of about $570m at the end of November 2007. It could be worth a lot more now. The lease has been extended but the structure of the deal is the same, according to one person familiar with the arrangement.

According to Financial Times' estimates derived from data on recent comparable sales provided by Real Capital Analytics, the building could fetch at least $1.7bn.

Patent Lift Opens Door for Cloning Deals

When Geron Corp. bought rights to the technique used to clone the first-ever mammal Dolly the sheep in 1999, its proposition was to cure degenerative disease.

But the pharmaceutical company soon turned its attention to meat.

Before it had made a single investment in the transgenic organs it told the market it would develop, Geron backed its first livestock-cloning deal. Later, it gained sole control over how cloning was marketed, stockpiling rights to the technology and fending off rivals in court, while fostering its use in beef and dairy farming. But its grip over the industry began to unravel last August when its exclusivity rights expired. Now, some foresee a land grab with more firms quietly buying interests in related technology.

Private-equity firms were fundamental to the foundation of the industry. British private-equity firm 3i Group PLC profited from the University of Edinburgh's sale of cloning technology to the pharma industry, and PPL Therapeutics, a former commercial cloning partner of the university that disbanded in the early 2000s, had early backing from private equity. The university's cloning technology research led to Dolly the sheep's birth in 1996. Meanwhile, Advanced Cell Technology, which pioneered cattle cloning before reaching a legal settlement over a patent violation dispute with Geron in 2006, was backed by Lincoln Park Capital and Socius Capital Group. The company was sold in 2016 to Astellas Pharma Inc.

Investment in cloning and genomic-related companies has surged in recent years. Private-equity and venture-capital investors poured nearly $6.6 billion into such deals globally from 2014 through the end of 2016, up from a total of $86 million from 2011 through the end of 2013, according to Moody's Analytics. The vast majority of capital, however, has gone into health-care applications, particularly those involving gene therapies.

Ashish Patel, who has a medical degree from the University of Oxford and is an investment manager at Mercia Technologies PLC, said the firm would consider investing in cloning organisms "if there was a benefit for health care." It recently invested in protein-cloning company Oxford Genetics Ltd.

But others, like Geron, see potential profits from applications in the livestock and dairy industries. The ability to replicate unusually productive dairy cows or high-quality beef cattle and then breed them gives producers more control over improving the quality of their stock.

However, cloning for food applications also faces its share of hurdles, including the costs associated with the technology and regulatory restrictions over its use, particularly in Europe.

A handful of companies appear ready to shoulder the risks. ViaGen LC and Clone International Pty Ltd., two companies that previously received backing and technical know-how from Geron, long dominated the market for livestock cloning. ViaGen already has cloned thousands of farm animals and has enough private backing from U.S. billionaire Randal Kirk to make cloning a staple of North American agriculture.

Cloning Timeline: Medicine to Meat

1996 The University of Edinburgh successfully clones the first mammal with the birth of Dolly the sheep, in partnership with private equity-backed biopharmaceutical company PPL Therapeutics.

1999 Geron Corp. acquires the rights to the technology used to clone Dolly with the initial intent to produce transgenic organs for medical applications, acquiring the University of Edinburgh's commercial cloning arm, Roslin Biomed, a spinout of Roslin Institute, the university's animal research department.

2001 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration asks food and livestock producers to voluntarily keep cloned animals and their offspring out of the food chain while it studies the safety implications of cloned livestock.

2001 Geron takes a stake in Australia-based livestock cloning company Clone International Pty Ltd. and gives it the exclusive license to use nuclear transfer in farming across Australia and New Zealand.

2003 Pig cloning company Revivicor Inc. forms as a spinout of PPL Therapeutics.

2003 ViaGen gets the global license to use cloning in farming everywhere but Australia and New Zealand when it buys Geron licensee ProLinia Inc.

2004 Geron buys a stake in Revivicor.

2006 Advanced Cell Technology and Geron settle a lawsuit over a patent dispute.

2007 ViaGen forms a joint venture with Trans Ova Genetics Corp. to promote bovine cloning in North America.

2008 The FDA rules that the use of cloned animals in meat production is as safe as that of animals bred through traditional methods, effectively paving the way for meat and dairy producers to embrace cloning technology in food production.

2008 Geron takes a stake in ViaGen when it merges ViaGen with its cloning intellectual property licensing joint venture (Start Licensing Inc.) held with Exeter Life Sciences Inc.

2010 A Boyalife Group stem cell databank officially launches in China.

2012 Geron sells ViaGen to Trans Ova Genetics.

2014 Intrexon Corp., a biotech firm owned by billionaire investor Randal Kirk, gains ownership of ViaGen as part of its acquisition of Trans Ova.

2016 Boyalife opens a beef cattle cloning factory capable of cloning 100,000 cow embryos a year.

2017 Exclusivity rights on cloning technology patents, including those held by Clone International in Australia, expire, opening the door for new market participants.

2017 Australian biotech company Reinclonation Pty. Ltd. launches a livestock cloning business.

When ViaGen merged with Geron's cloning licensing cache in 2008, it secured global rights to clone cattle and pigs for agricultural purposes everywhere except Australia and New Zealand. Geron took 27% of the Cedar Park, Texas, company's equity at the time, a stake that rose to 40% by 2011, and provided it with private loans, regulatory filings show. Mr. Kirk bought ViaGen in 2014 through Intrexon Corp., a biotechnology holding company he controls. Neither Mr. Kirk nor his company responded to requests for comment.

In October 2017, Third Security, a private-equity firm led by Mr. Kirk and a major investor in crop modification, bought $100 million of additional stock options in the holding company. Mr. Kirk said the funding would let Intrexon commercialize its "most mature" technologies. Jeffrey Perez, senior vice president at the biotech group and former patent strategist at Third Security, had hailed an "uptick" in demand for bovine reproduction services on an earnings call two months earlier.

Companies like ViaGen, however, soon may face growing competition from overseas.

China-based Boyalife Group, a biotech company formed by Chief Executive and Chairman Xiaochun Xu, has already built economies of scale that could move cloning beyond its niche status. The company stands to benefit from China's need to improve the quality of its beef stock, as its lean cattle historically were bred for agricultural labor.

In 2009, Mr. Xu, who once worked for Pfizer Inc., helped facilitate an initial framework agreement among the University of Edinburgh, Peking University and China's Wuxi municipal government to establish a joint venture to advance stem cell research. However, it isn't clear whether that framework resulted in a definitive partnership that exists today.

A spokeswoman for the University of Edinburgh said the university has no agreement or relationship with Boyalife.

In 2016, Boyalife opened a beef cattle cloning factory capable of cloning 100,000 cows a year, which is expected to start supplying the beef industry within two years, Mr. Xu said.

"There's a lot more technology being incubated and fostered into commercial businesses, including cloning," said Mr. Xu, who has a doctorate in immunology from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

Meanwhile, in Australia, Clone International co-founder and Chief Executive Richard Fry said the company's exclusive license to clone cattle in Australia and New Zealand expired in September, after the patents passed their 17-year sell-by date. That month, Australian rival Reinclonation Pty. Ltd. started a commercial livestock-cloning business, after previously using cloning only for research purposes.

"It's like a light bulb," Mr. Fry said. "Other companies can [now] come in and set up competition."

There is something odd about the insider trading case against Equifax IT executive Jun Ying. According to the US justice department , Mr Ying realised in August last year that the credit monitoring company had suffered a big data breach, searched for the impact of a similar breach on the share price of Experian , a rival credit checker, then sold almost $1m of stock in Equifax to avoid potential losses.

Mr Ying has not yet presented his defence (and his lawyers declined to comment). But the Experian hack provided little impetus to sell.

Experian announced in October 2015 that hackers had stolen the personal information of 15m customers of T-Mobile , the US wireless operator. Was the fallout dramatic, incentivising any later breach victim to run for the hills? Not really. T-Mobile was "incredibly angry". There were some lawsuits. Experian , whose revenues were $4.2bn that year, set aside $20m to cover one-off costs. Shares in the London-listed company fell 3.8 per cent on the day. That was the stock's low point. It has since risen by more than 50 per cent.

If there was a lesson to take from Experian , it is that investors, the public and customers have become inured to information theft. That lesson is visible, too, in Equifax 's own breach, although it was not quite so apparent at the time.

After Equifax revealed last year that data on more than 140m Americans had been stolen, its stock fell more than a third. The breach ignited a storm of political and regulatory protest.

However, the shares have since clawed back most of their losses. Although there were $114m of net one-off charges last year, the revenue drop attributed to the breach was just 3 per cent in the most recent quarter. Investigations and lawsuits continue and there is the chance of nasty surprises. But the credit checking market is tightly controlled, supporting operating margins of almost 30 per cent. The lesson from the next data breach: buy the dip.

? Jun Ying sold his stock before hack was made public ? Executive avoided $117,000 loss

A former Equifax executive has been charged by US authorities with insider trading for allegedly selling almost $1m worth of shares before the credit reporting company revealed a massive database breach last year.

Jun Ying, 42, who had been in line to become the company's global chief information officer, is accused of disposing of his shares in the group after learning it had been hacked. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission said Mr Ying sold his stock after looking for online information on how a big data breach can affect a share price. Paulino do Rego Barros, Equifax 's interim chief executive officer, said it had "separated" Mr Ying from the company after investigating the share sales and had reported its findings to the government. "We are fully co-operating with the DoJ and the SEC, and will continue to do so." he said.

Mr Ying's lawyers at Schulte Roth & Zabel said they would not comment as the case was pending.

The data breach last year exposed the personal details, including social security numbers, of almost 150m consumers in the US, and also affected 700,000 in the UK. The hack occurred after Equifax failed to fix a software flaw, despite being notified by the government. The hackers gained access to Equifax 's systems in May last year and the company got its first hint of the attack in July.

According to the indictment, Mr Ying was asked to assist in the response to the breach in August although he was initially told the hack had hit an Equifax customer, not the company itself.

The government alleges Mr Ying figured out the truth before he was officially informed by Equifax , pointing to two texts in which he allegedly told a colleague, "Sounds bad. We may be the one breached", and "I'm starting to put 2 and 2 together".

"As alleged in our complaint, Ying used confidential information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach," said Richard Best of the SEC's Atlanta regional office.

In late August, he allegedly searched online about the stock price impact of the 2015 breach of Experian , another credit bureau. An hour later, Mr Ying allegedly exercised all his stock options in Equifax and sold them for $950,000.

The SEC said he avoided over $117,000 in losses as a result. Soon after, Mr Ying, then the chief information officer of Equifax's United States Information Systems unit, was told that the company was the victim of the breach. Lex page 10

A former Equifax executive has been charged with insider trading for allegedly selling almost $1m worth of shares before the credit reporting company revealed a massive database breach.

Jun Ying, 42, who had been in line to become chief information officer, was accused of disposing of his shares in Equifax after learning that the company had been hacked.

The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission said Mr Ying sold the Equifax stock after looking for information on how a big data breach could affect a share price.

"Our office takes the abuse of trust inherent in insider trading very seriously," said Byung Pak, US attorney. Paulino do Rego Barros, Equifax 's interim chief executive, said it had "separated" Mr Ying from the company after investigating the share sales and had reported its findings to the government. "We are fully co-operating with the DOJ and the SEC," he said.

Mr Ying's lawyers at Schulte Roth & Zabel declined to comment.

The data breach last year exposed the personal details of almost 150m consumers in the US. The hack occurred after the group had failed to fix a software flaw, despite being notified by the government. The stock fell almost 14 per cent after the announcement. The hackers had gained access to Equifax data in May last year and the company got its first hint of the attack in July.

According to the DOJ indictment, Mr Ying was asked to assist in the response to the breach in August, although he was initially told the hack had hit an Equifax customer, not the company itself, according to the DOJ and SEC. They claim Mr Ying figured out the truth before he was informed by Equifax .

In August, he allegedly used search engine Bing to research the stock price impact of the 2015 breach of Experian . Experian shares fell 3.8 per cent when the hack was revealed in October 2015, although they had risen 50 per cent by August 2017. An hour later, Mr Ying allegedly exercised all his stock options in Equifax and sold them for $950,000, avoiding more than $117,000 in losses.

"As alleged in our complaint, Ying used confidential information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach," said Richard Best of the SEC's Atlanta regional office.

In late August, he allegedly searched online about the stock price impact of the 2015 breach of Experian , another credit bureau. An hour later, Mr Ying allegedly exercised all his stock options in Equifax and sold them for $950,000.

The SEC said he avoided over $117,000 in losses as a result. Soon after, Mr Ying, then the chief information officer of Equifax's United States Information Systems unit, was told that the company was the victim of the breach. Lex page 10

There is something odd about the insider trading case against Equifax IT executive Jun Ying. According to the US justice department , Mr Ying realised in August last year that the credit monitoring company had suffered a big data breach, searched for the impact of a similar breach on the share price of Experian , a rival credit checker, then sold almost $1m of stock in Equifax to avoid potential losses.

Mr Ying has not yet presented his defence (and his lawyers declined to comment). But the Experian hack provided little impetus to sell.

Experian announced in October 2015 that hackers had stolen the personal information of 15m customers of T-Mobile , the US wireless operator. Was the fallout dramatic, incentivising any later breach victim to run for the hills? Not really. T-Mobile was "incredibly angry". There were some lawsuits. Experian , whose revenues were $4.2bn that year, set aside $20m to cover one-off costs. Shares in the London-listed company fell 3.8 per cent on the day. That was the stock's low point. It has since risen by more than 50 per cent.

If there was a lesson to take from Experian , it is that investors, the public and customers have become inured to information theft. That lesson is visible, too, in Equifax 's own breach, although it was not quite so apparent at the time.

After Equifax revealed last year that data on more than 140m Americans had been stolen, its stock fell more than a third. The breach ignited a storm of political and regulatory protest.

However, the shares have since clawed back most of their losses. Although there were $114m of net one-off charges last year, the revenue drop attributed to the breach was just 3 per cent in the most recent quarter. Investigations and lawsuits continue and there is the chance of nasty surprises. But the credit checking market is tightly controlled, supporting operating margins of almost 30 per cent. The lesson from the next data breach: buy the dip.

How Jamie Dimon came to rue his Bear Stearns deal

The takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase, sealed exactly a decade ago in the crucible of the 2008 financial crisis, was one of the signature deals of a turbulent year, and the knockdown price of $2 a share was a shock to Wall Street.

Even after the terms were raised to $10 a share, JPMorgan and its chief executive Jamie Dimon appeared to have pulled off a coup. Acting at the urging of the US government, which feared the fallout from Bear s failure, JPMorgan had got a prestigious Wall Street franchise   plus a stately octagonal tower on Madison Avenue   for about $1.2bn, a fraction of Bear s $11bn in common equity.

Ten years on, the bank is comfortably the biggest by assets in the US and has market-leading businesses all across the investment bank, some of them boosted by Bear. Mr Dimon, too, has grown into a role as elder statesman of the industry, reminding investors last month that his crisis-era acquisitions saved thousands of jobs and  avoid[ed] the devastation of communities .

Yet the full cost of the deal to JPMorgan probably outweighed the benefits.

By the time of his letter to shareholders in 2012, Mr Dimon was already complaining about the  poor  systems he inherited from Bear, as well as a big pile-up of litigation connected to mis-sold mortgages. In 2015, he lamented that the cost of settling lawsuits was pushing $19bn, about 70 per cent of which was connected to Bear and Washington Mutual, another distressed asset JPMorgan picked up in 2008.  We did not anticipate that we would have to pay the penalties we ultimately were required to pay,  Mr Dimon wrote.

Bear hit trouble because it had loaded up on mortgage-related assets in what seemed to be an ever-rising housing market. When prices began to fall and loans went bad, creditors panicked and demanded their money back. JPMorgan initially stepped in with emergency funds to Bear on Friday, March 14. But over that weekend, the US Treasury strong-armed Mr Dimon into buying the whole thing.

Bear was the smallest and most highly leveraged of the top firms on Wall Street, but rivals such as Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers were also showing signs of distress. The government feared carnage in Asian markets on Monday if Bear were allowed to fail. At the same time, the Treasury wanted to send out a signal, according to people in the room at the time: if a bank got into trouble and the government came in to help, its shareholders would suffer.

The US Treasury declined to comment, as did Neel Kashkari, the former Treasury official who handled negotiations on the ground. He is now president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve.

Mr Dimon had big plans for Bear at the outset. In his 2009 shareholder letter he noted mounting losses on the bank s $370bn of assets but said that, in time, the acquisition should add $1bn to JPMorgan s annual earnings.

He said he was particularly pleased to bulk up in energy trading and also prime broking   a business within investment banks that acts like a concierge to hedge funds, supplying them with everything from loans and research to introductions to investors. Bear was dominant in both and JPMorgan remains a leader in prime broking. It sold out of physical commodities in 2014, however, with a $3.5bn sale of the business to Mercuria.

The building trade

A day after the board of Bear Stearns agreed a sale to JPMorgan Chase, some wag taped a two-dollar bill on the front door of the company s headquarters. Bear did not own that building at 383 Madison Avenue, a 43-floor tower in the old financial heart of Manhattan. But it did have a right to buy it at the end of its lease in 2012, provided it paid off the associated debt of the lessor. According to Bear s last annual report, that option was worth a maximum of about $570m at the end of November 2007. It could be worth a lot more now. The lease has been extended but the structure of the deal is the same, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. The building could fetch at least $1.7bn, according to FT estimates derived from data on recent comparable sales provided by Real Capital Analytics.

Bear also gave a leg-up to JPMorgan s equities business, through characters such as David Freedman, who runs merger arbitrage, and Nick Rosato, head of North American research. Institutional Investor magazine ranked Bear s research as the second best on Wall Street in 2007, two notches ahead of JPMorgan. Now JPMorgan is number one in the survey.

Still, many of Bear s big hitters, especially in bond trading, scattered almost instantly. Today there are no ex-Bear people on JPMorgan s 11-person operating committee, or among the five corporate officers. According to one estimate, less than 4,000 of 14,000 Bear employees at the time of the deal were still at JPMorgan within a couple of years. These days, about 2,000 remain.

Mr Dimon had done his best to smooth things over with Bear s shell-shocked employees. But during a first meeting on a rainy Wednesday following the deal, in the second-floor auditorium at Bear s headquarters, he was barracked by senior managing directors, according to several people who were there. When he made an analogy to a  shotgun wedding  one trader fired back that it felt more like a  rape .

All had been hurt by the collapse of the share price. Employees owned about one-third of Bear s stock, often accumulated during long careers at the company, and at much higher prices than $2 a share, or even $10. A year earlier the stock had been at $170.

 I thought I d be working until I was 100 years old,  says John Fitzgerald, who ran an expert-network business within Bear s equity unit.

This was a tight knit group, says Michael Kiernan, who used to run the morning call on Bear s equities floor, when analysts presented to the bank s sales force. As the company began to splinter he used his connections to maintain a giant Excel spreadsheet, hoping to link people to job opportunities elsewhere. He hosted a networking event at the Public House bar on East 41st Street that first Thursday; 10 years on, he says,  hundreds  still show up to yearly reunions.

 It was a scrappy firm with good culture,  says one former top executive.  We always viewed ourselves as the kids from the wrong side of the block. 

JPMorgan s 2017 annual report, filed a fortnight ago, still shows a handful of outstanding litigation proceedings connected to Bear. Given the already huge bill for litigation, it seems unlikely that any other big bank will come to the aid of the government in the next financial crisis, says Rodgin Cohen, a Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer who acted for Bear s board on the sale.

JPMorgan s $13bn settlement with the justice department over sales of mortgage-backed securities in 2013, in particular, appeared to involve an  unreasonable  component for Bear s misdeeds, says Mr Cohen.

Mr Dimon, meanwhile, was still bitter in his 2015 letter to shareholders.

 In case you were wondering: No, we would not do something like Bear Stearns again,  he wrote.  In fact, I don t think our board would let me take the call. 

Where are they now?

Business
Tesla's Make-Or-Break Moment Is Fast Approaching; The auto maker is racing to meet an ambitious production target for its Model 3 sedan

By Tim Higgins and Susan Pulliam

Copyright  2018, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

Elon Musk recently told attendees at the South by Southwest festival that two things are keeping him up at night: an apocalyptic future created by artificial intelligence, and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-teslas-production-delays-parts-of-model-3-were-being-made-by-hand-1507321057" of Tesla Inc.'s Model 3 car.

Mr. Musk has good reason to worry about Tesla. The auto maker is entering one of the most critical phases in its history, a make-or-break period in which Tesla must boost production of the Model 3 or possibly face severe financial consequences.

In April, Tesla will reveal whether it is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-posts-smaller-than-expected-loss-1518039313" of producing 5,000 Model 3s a week a goal that it already twice delayed. The Model 3 is Tesla's mainstream electric-car offering, priced more affordably than Tesla's luxury models, and a key part of Mr. Musk's strategy to broaden the company's business.

Meeting the goal of 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of June is critical to generating enough cash to sustain operations without having to raise more capital. Tesla burned through on average about $1 billion a quarter last year, largely because of heavy investments to bring production of the Model 3 online. That left it with nearly $3.4 billion in cash at year-end, suggesting that at a similar pace it would be out of cash later this year unless it can raise more funds or substantially boost production.

UBS analyst Colin Langan calculates that Tesla will continue burning cash until it reaches the 5,000-a-week inflection point for a quarter, a milestone that he calculates would generate about $1 billion in working capital in the short term.

If Tesla can't meet the goal, it would face greater pressure to raise money from the debt or equity markets, which could be challenging if investors lose confidence. Tesla says it has $2 billion in unused credit facilities and funds, though some of the capital is subject to specific conditions for use. However, it also faces higher interest payments tied to $10 billion in debt and increased costs associated with the production ramp.

Since going public in 2010, Tesla has burned through about $10 billion in cash, an unusually large sum for a publicly traded U.S. company of its size, said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Tesla has a market capitalization of roughly $57 billion.

Barclays analyst Brian Johnson expects the company to raise more money in the third quarter if it proves it can build 5,000 Model 3s a week a rate equating to roughly 250,000 vehicles in a single year, about what a typical automotive factory produces.

Mr. Musk said at SXSW that Tesla is "making good progress" on Model 3 production. He is grappling with these challenges after losing a number of financial executives. In recent days, Tesla's chief accounting officer and treasurer both left, following last year's exit of the financial chief and last month's departure of the top sales executive.

The company declined to make Deepak Ahuja, who rejoined as chief financial officer last year, available to comment.

Mr. Musk has repeatedly defied the odds. At SXSW on Sunday, he recounted how Tesla nearly went into bankruptcy in 2008 when money ran tight. Although many investors shorted the stock over the years, he proved Tesla could build a global luxury brand of electric cars with a devoted following beyond environmentalists.

But Tesla is no longer a startup. It is a 38,000-person company that is trying to compete with the world's largest auto makers. Mr. Musk has eschewed operating profit and racked up debt as he chases his dream of making a mainstream electric sedan. He had earlier pledged to deliver 500,000 vehicles this year, about five times last year's total.

These hurdles have weighed on Tesla's stock. Its share price has stalled since surging in early 2017 to give it a market value rivaling General Motors Co. The stock has fallen about 14% since around the time it began production of the Model 3 nine months ago.

"Some big investors are losing patience," said Nathan Weiss of Unit Economics, a research arm of investment firm Weiss, Harrington & Associates LLC, which has a bearish bet on Tesla but doesn't own shares. "They are less excited about it than they were a year ago."

Some investors are watching indicators of credit strength that are generally regarded as a gauge of a company's likelihood of bankruptcy, such as the "Altman Z-Score," which was developed by a New York University professor, Edward Altman in the late 1960s.

Based on the Z-Score formula which takes into account a number of variables, including share price, working capital, retained earnings and other items Tesla had a score of 1.26, its lowest score for any quarter since 2014. Any company with a score below 1.8 is considered distressed by many investors. A score of 1.0 or lower suggests bankruptcy is likely within two years.

Three of Tesla's 10 largest shareholders have recently sold shares of the auto maker, according to the shareholders' latest quarterly filings. Fidelity Investments, the second-largest Tesla shareholder behind Mr. Musk with a nearly 10% stake, sold close to one-third of its shares in the final three quarters of 2017, filings show. A Fidelity spokesman declined to comment.

Other shareholders have piled in. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. more than doubled its stake in the fourth quarter, making it the fourth-largest owner of Tesla shares.

Some investors say public school districts need their own operating system.

Entrepreneur Ahsan Rizvi, who used to work in a U.S. government foreign-development program, may have created one with his startup, Kiddom Inc.

Mr. Rizvi created Kiddom initially as a platform providing teachers lesson plans, teaching materials and other online resources at no cost. Now Kiddom, founded in 2013, has secured $15 million in new venture capital, making it the latest venture-backed platform offering an enterprise-grade product for tech-hungry U.S. schools.

"We really wanted to create something that would have teacher buy-in," said Mr. Rizvi, formerly with the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp.

Education-focused Owl Ventures led Kiddom's Series B round, with participation by Khosla Ventures and bringing total capital raised to date to $21.5 million. Khosla's Keith Rabois led Kiddom's seed and A rounds.

Kiddom has no revenue yet, as it has basically given away its content and services.

But the new funding is meant to fuel the launch of its enterprise offering, called Academy, which is designed as a way for school administrators to gather and analyze troves of data measuring student and class progress.

If the company were getting a report card on its product's adoption rates, it might earn an "A" grade. More than 70% of the nation's school districts have at least one teacher using Kiddom, according to Mr. Rizvi, mainly driven by word-of-mouth.

"It is the fastest-growing company we've ever encountered, by a wide margin," said Owl Managing Director Tory Patterson, who is joining Kiddom's board.

Edtech venture financing hit a high point in 2015, topping out at more than $1.5 billion, but that dipped to around $1 billion the next two years, according to PitchBook Data.

Other startups working on classroom management software include FreshGrade, which raised more than $11 million in 2016 with Reach Capital and Accel. Brightwheel, focused on early education, secured a $10 million Series A led by GGV Capital about a year ago.

Kiddom says K-12 teachers can use its platform to create curriculum in line with either Common Core or customized standards, while accommodating individualized learning.

The company has 26 employees with offices in San Francisco and New York.

Former Equifax executive charged with insider trading

A former Equifax executive has been charged with insider trading for allegedly selling almost $1m worth of shares before the credit reporting company revealed a massive database breach last year.

Jun Ying, 42, who had been in line to become the firm s global chief information officer, is accused by the US government of disposing of his shares in Equifax after learning that the company had been hacked.

The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission said Mr Ying sold the Equifax stock after looking for information on how a big data breach can affect a share price.

 Our office takes the abuse of trust inherent in insider trading very seriously and will prosecute those who seek to profit in this manner,  said Byung Pak, US attorney for the northern district of Georgia, in a statement.

Paulino do Rego Barros, Equifax  s interim chief executive, said it had  separated  Mr Ying from the company after investigating the share sales and had reported its findings to the government.

 We are fully co-operating with the DoJ and the SEC, and will continue to do so,  he said in a statement.

Mr Ying s lawyers at Schulte Roth & Zabel said they would not comment as the case was pending.

The data breach last year exposed the personal details, including social security numbers, of almost 150m consumers in the US. The hack occurred after the company had failed to fix a software flaw, despite being notified by the government. Shares in the company fell almost 14 per cent after the announcement.

The hackers had gained access to Equifax data in May last year and the company got its first hint of the attack in July.

According to the DoJ indictment, Mr Ying was asked to assist in the response to the breach in August, although he was initially told the hack had hit an Equifax customer, not the company itself, according to the DoJ and SEC.

The government alleges Mr Ying figured out the truth before he was officially informed by Equifax , pointing to two texts in which he allegedly told a colleague:  Sounds bad. We may be the one breached  and  I m starting to put 2 and 2 together .

 As alleged in our complaint, Ying used confidential information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach,  said Richard Best, director of the SEC s Atlanta regional office.

In late August, he allegedly used Bing to search online about the stock price impact of the 2015 breach of Experian , another credit bureau. Experian shares had fallen 3.8 per cent when the hack was revealed in October 2015, although they had risen around 50 per cent by August of 2017.

An hour after searching online, Mr Ying allegedly exercised all his stock options in

Equifax and sold them for $950,000. The SEC said he avoided more than $117,000 in losses as a result.

Soon after, Mr Ying, then the chief information officer of Equifax s United States Information Systems unit, was told that the company was the victim of the breach.

In mid-September, after the resignation of Equifax  s global chief information officer, Mr Ying was offered the top job, according to the SEC. The offer was apparently withdrawn after the company learned of the trades.

In November, the company said four other executives, including the chief financial officer, who had sold shares ahead of the announcement of the breach in September 2017, had not known about the hack when the sales occurred.

The data breach was one of the largest in recent history and sparked several investigations, including by the SEC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation . As well as nearly half of all US citizens, Equifax said that 700,000 customers in the UK had also been affected.

The company s chief information officer, chief security officer and its chief executive, Richard Smith , have since resigned.

The cowboy state goes crypto-crazy

Cheyenne in Wyoming is, on the face of it, an unlikely  cryptopia. 

Yet the capital of the Cowboy State looks set to become a haven for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, drawn to the city   population 59,466   for its enlightened view on the potential for bitcoin and other digital currencies to shake up the world s financial system.

In public, the big push has come fromTyler Lindholm, a 34 year-old Navy veteran who has served as a Republican member of the state s House of Representatives for the past three years.

From the Lindholm family ranch near Devil s Tower, the iconic rock formation featured in the 1977 sci-fi movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, he has set out to form a cadre of likeminded lawmakers. Together, they ve passedfive bills aimed at attracting crypto-related businesses. Governor Matt Mead signed them into law last week.

Among the highlights: a change to state laws to recognise tokens issued in initial coin offerings (ICOs) as distinct from money and securities, and therefore not subject to laws on money transmission.

 New industry, economic diversity, and the best part is that it wont cost the taxpayer a dime!  Mr Lindholmtweetedon Friday.

Crypto-related businesses have already leased office space downtown. One of them is theDigital Asset Trade Association (DATA), which describes itself as a lobbying and self-regulating body for the digital currency industry. It basically aims to do for crypto what the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association does for big banks and brokers.

Behind the scenes, a lot of the running has been done by Caitlin Long, a 22-year veteran of Wall Street who recently stepped down as president and chairman of Symbiont, a blockchain company. She says she started applying pressure last summer, when she tried to donate bitcoins to a foundation supporting female engineers, run by her alma mater, the University of Wyoming.

But Coinbase couldn t process the transaction; Wyoming was one of a handful of US states in which the exchange did not operate, because of the state s requirement that it maintain dedicated fiat currency reserves equal to the aggregate face value of all funds held on behalf of customers. The company said in June 2016 that it was  impractical, costly and inefficient  for it to do so.

That had to change. So she called up an old college friend, Rob Jennings, president of Florida-based RWJ Consulting, and David Pope, an accountant in Cheyenne, and formed theWyoming Blockchain Coalition. Its mission: to educate Wyomingites  about the power of blockchain technology to cut costs, streamline administrative processes and spur entirely new businesses. 

Most important, she says, is that utility tokens are now  expressly recognised as legal somewhere in the world.  Other territories likeSwitzerland, Singapore, Japan and Gibraltar have  favourable regulations,  she notes, but an elected body never officially made them law. Until now.

 Lawyers can now give an opinion [on initial coin offerings],  she says.  It s always better for an attorney to have an expressed statute to point to. 

(Tyler Lindholm, right)

No wonder crypto-visionaries are getting a little misty eyed.

 As I drove through Wyoming three years ago I thought,  this is the most beautiful state I ve driven through',  tweeted Andrew, a user with the handle @luther0333, on Sunday.  Now I feel it might be the wisest.

We recently caught up with Michael Rolph, co-founder and chief executive of Yoyo Wallet; Anne Boden, founder and CEO of Starling Bank; and Michael Kent, co-founder and CEO of Azimo. Thethree UK fintech entrepreneursdiscussed the recent introduction of "open banking" reforms that force banks to open up access to the accounts of clients who give their permission. Ms Boden said: "You could have the account provided one institution and the front-end app provided by another institution and that could be an Amazon-type institution." Mr Rolph gave the example of a new app to automatically collect loyalty points on purchases, saying it could be "a huge change". Mr Kent said: "I think it is faster for the technology companies to do the financial piece than for the financial companies to do the technology piece. I'm not long the traditional banking industry."Watch the full video here.

Cyber threats force US clearing house on to cloud

Options Clearing Corporation is drawing up plans to move its operations into cloud computing as the exchange industry battles the threat posed by cyber crime.

John Davidson, its chief operating officer, told the Financial Times the group has a three-year plan to phase out its 20-year-old technology and put its business on to remote computer servers.

Its plan underlines growing concerns from the exchange industry about the risks posed to the financial system by threats to their cyber security.

The US options clearing house clears more than 460m trades a month for the US options markets, as well as some emerging cryptocurrency futures.

DTCC, the main US securities clearing house, last year said cloud computing had reached  a pivotal point  because they were now more secure, cheaper and sophisticated than in-house IT systems.

Some regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as Finra, have moved their operations to private commercial services.

Mr Davidson said the move was prompted in part because it was hard to match the investments of the big technology companies.

 Amazon is going to spend billions on information security for Amazon Web Services this year. It offers security and economies of scale,  he said.

Many exchanges have started moving part of their own systems to the cloud, like historical data and collateral management although few clearing houses have publicly committed to doing so. Clearers play a critical role in financial markets, managing the risk to the market if a company defaults.

 We have plans to move the risk system, then the core system over the next three years. We are in the process of selecting the core vendors, and likely to finalise it by the end of the year,  said Mr Davidson.

McKinsey, the consultancy, has also forecast big tech companies that operated cloud infrastructure, such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, could spur further innovation in financial services.

It highlighted Microsoft s purchase of Maluuba, a specialist in artificial intelligence for speech and image recognition, as one example.

But a survey by the World Federation of Exchanges found its members were concerned that  cost savings on one end of a system must be weighed against the risk of data leakage, creating potential liability and reputational damage .

Mr Davidson added that OCC was comfortable with the performance of bitcoin futures. It has not changed the demands on investors for the initial margin, or amount of the trade price they must pay upfront to backstop the trade. It acts as the clearing house for Cboe Global Markets s cryptocurrency futures contracts.

 We get requests as to whether we d take crypto as margin. There is no way that would happen,  he said.

Cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks Inc. has agreed to buy cloud security company Evident.io for $300 million in cash.

Evident.io had raised more than $49 million in venture-capital funding. The company's investors included Bain Capital Ventures, GV, In-Q-Tel, True Ventures and Venrock.

Palo Alto expects to close the deal in its fiscal third quarter.

Evident.io's co-founders, Tim Prendergast and Justin Lundy, will join Palo Alto.

Evident.io, based in Pleasanton, Calif., provides the Evident Security Platform used with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.'s Azure.

Palo Alto's other acquisitions include a $105 million deal in February 2017 for LightCyber, which used machine learning to identify threats based on behavioral anomalies. LightCyber's technology was used in Palo Alto's Magnifier application announced in January. Palo Alto bought Cyvera for $200 million in 2014.

Last month, Palo Alto said adjusted earnings rose by more than half as revenue increased 28% to $542.4 million for the second quarter ended Jan. 31.

Palo Alto shares rose 55 cents after hours to $189.
